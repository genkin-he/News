            "description": "<div class=\"etf_articles__body\"><p>Gold exchange-traded funds have become a popular investment vehicle for individuals and institutions seeking exposure to gold without the complexities of physical ownership. These financial instruments provide an efficient and cost-effective way to invest in the yellow metal, offering liquidity, security and ease of access.<br/><br/>This report delves into the structure, benefits, risks and performance of gold ETFs, as well as their role in a diversified investment portfolio.</p><h2>Understanding Gold ETFs</h2><p>A gold ETF is an exchange-traded fund that aims to track the price of gold. These funds typically hold gold bullion or gold-related assets and trade on stock exchanges, making them accessible to investors who wish to gain exposure to gold without dealing with physical storage and security concerns.<br/><br/>Gold ETFs are structured either as physically backed funds, which hold gold bullion in secure vaults, or as derivative ETFs, which use futures and swaps to replicate gold price movements. The former is more popular among investors seeking an investment with a direct correlation with gold prices.</p><h3>History and Evolution of Gold ETFs</h3><p>Gold ETFs were first introduced in the U.S. in 2004 with the launch of the <a href=\"/gld\"><strong>SPDR Gold Trust (GLD)</strong></a>. Since then, they have proliferated, with various issuers offering gold ETFs with different characteristics. <br/><br/>The growth of gold ETFs has been fueled by increased investor demand for commodities, portfolio diversification and hedging against inflation and currency risks.</p><h3>Key Features of Gold ETFs</h3><p>1.   <strong> Liquidity</strong>: Gold ETFs trade on stock exchanges, providing investors with the ability to buy and sell shares throughout the trading day at market prices.<br/><br/>2.    <strong>Transparency</strong>: The holdings of gold ETFs are publicly disclosed, ensuring that investors know what they are investing in.<br/><br/>3.   <strong> Diversification</strong>: Gold ETFs offer a hedge against economic instability and inflation, making them a valuable component of a diversified portfolio.<br/><br/>4.    <strong>Cost-Effectiveness</strong>: Investing in gold ETFs eliminates the need for physical storage, security and insurance, reducing the associated costs.<br/><br/>5.    <strong>Tax Efficiency</strong>: Depending on the jurisdiction, gold ETFs may offer tax advantages compared to physical gold investments.</p><h3>Advantages of Gold ETFs</h3><p>1. <strong>Convenience and Accessibility: </strong>Gold ETFs provide an easy way for investors to gain exposure to gold without the need to purchase and store physical gold. These funds can be traded through brokerage accounts just like stocks, making them highly accessible.<br/><br/>2. <strong>Portfolio Diversification: </strong>Gold is known for its low correlation with traditional asset classes such as stocks and bonds. Including gold ETFs in an investment portfolio can help reduce overall portfolio risk and volatility, especially during periods of economic uncertainty.<br/><br/>3. <strong>Inflation Hedge: </strong>Gold has historically been considered a safe-haven asset that preserves value during inflationary periods. Gold ETFs offer a way to hedge against inflation without the complications of owning physical gold.<br/><br/>4. <strong>Lower Transaction Costs: </strong>Investing in gold ETFs is typically more cost-effective than buying and storing physical gold. Investors avoid markups, storage fees and insurance costs associated with physical gold ownership.<br/><br/>5. <strong>Liquidity and Transparency: </strong>Gold ETFs trade on major stock exchanges, ensuring high liquidity and price transparency. Investors can buy or sell shares at market prices without significant price discrepancies.</p><h3><strong>Risks Associated with Gold ETFs</strong></h3><div class=\"block--dfp text-center block block--dfp-ad39df3d1c-8e04-4acd-9bc3-71341c4bf83f\"><div class=\"block__content\"><div id=\"js-dfp-tag-in_article_unit\"><script type=\"d9f7436346d4aaed374c6e53-text/javascript\">\ngoogletag.display('js-dfp-tag-in_article_unit');\n</script></div></div></div><p>1. <strong>Price Volatility: </strong>Gold prices can be highly volatile, influenced by factors such as geopolitical events, central bank policies and changes in investor sentiment. As a result, gold ETFs can experience substantial price fluctuations.<br/><br/>2. <strong>Expense Ratios: </strong>While gold ETFs are cost-effective compared to physical gold, they still incur management fees and expense ratios that can eat into investment returns over time.<br/><br/>3. <strong>Tracking Error: </strong>Some gold ETFs may not perfectly track the price of gold due to factors such as management fees, derivative exposure and market conditions. This can lead to discrepancies between the ETF's performance and gold prices.<br/><br/>4. <strong>Counterparty Risks: </strong>Derivative gold ETFs, which use derivatives rather than holding physical gold, expose investors to counterparty risks associated with the financial institutions that issue these derivatives.<br/><br/>5. <strong>Regulatory and Tax Considerations: </strong>The tax treatment of gold ETFs varies by country. Some jurisdictions treat gold ETFs as collectibles, which may result in higher capital gains tax rates. Investors should be aware of tax implications before investing.</p><h3>Popular Gold ETFs</h3><p>Several gold ETFs have gained prominence in the market due to their liquidity, asset size, and tracking efficiency. Some of the most widely traded gold ETFs include:<br/><br/>1.    <a href=\"/GLD\"><strong>SPDR Gold Trust (GLD)</strong></a>: The largest and most liquid gold ETF, backed by physical gold stored in secure vaults.<br/>2.    <a href=\"/IAU\"><strong>iShares Gold Trust (IAU)</strong></a>: A large, liquid, and cost-effective gold ETF with a lower expense ratio compared to GLD.<br/>3.    <a href=\"/IAUM\"><strong>iShares Gold Trust Micro (IAUM)</strong></a>: Currently the cheapest gold ETF with an expense ratio of 0.09%.<br/>4.    <a href=\"/OUNZ\"><strong>VanEck Merk Gold Trust (OUNZ)</strong></a>: Allows investors to take physical delivery of gold, a unique feature among gold ETFs.<br/>5.    <a href=\"/UGL\"><strong>ProShares Ultra Gold (UGL)</strong></a>: A leveraged gold ETF that aims to deliver twice the daily performance of gold prices.</p><h3><br/><strong>Performance of Gold ETFs</strong></h3><p>The performance of gold ETFs is closely linked to gold prices, which are influenced by:</p><p><br/>•    <strong>Monetary Policy</strong>: Central bank interest-rate decisions affect gold prices, as lower interest rates make gold more attractive relative to interest-bearing assets.<br/><br/>•    <strong>Economic Uncertainty</strong>: Periods of economic turmoil or geopolitical instability often drive investors toward gold as a safe haven.<br/><br/>•    <strong>Inflation and Currency Trends</strong>: A weaker U.S. dollar and rising inflation tend to support gold prices.<br/><br/>•    <strong>Demand and Supply Dynamics</strong>: Jewelry demand, central bank purchases, and mining output affect long-term gold prices.<br/><br/>Historically, gold ETFs have provided strong returns during financial crises, such as the 2008-2009 economic downturn and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when gold prices surged due to increased investor demand for safe-haven assets.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>Gold ETFs offer a convenient, liquid, and cost-effective means of investing in gold without the complexities of physical ownership. They serve as an excellent hedge against inflation, economic uncertainty, and currency fluctuations. Investors should be mindful, though, of risks such as price volatility, tracking errors and expense ratios.<br/><br/>While gold ETFs provide numerous advantages, they should be considered part of a diversified portfolio rather than a standalone investment. <br/><br/>Understanding the nuances of different gold ETFs, their tax implications and market dynamics can help investors make informed decisions. As global economic conditions continue to evolve, gold ETFs remain a valuable tool for those seeking exposure to the precious metals market.</p></div>",

This, in turn, provided a temporary boost to investor confidence. </p><p>Following the initial decline, the <a href=\"https://www.etf.com/IBIT\"><strong>iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT)</strong></a> climbed back to the green, rising more than 7% off its morning low. </p><p>The imposition of 25% tariffs on Mexican and most Canadian imports, along with a 10% tariff on Chinese goods, has heightened fears of a trade war, leading investors to retreat from riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. Analysts suggest that these trade policies could fuel volatility across various markets, with cryptocurrencies being particularly affected due to their speculative nature.  </p><div class=\"block--dfp text-center block block--dfp-ad39df3d1c-8e04-4acd-9bc3-71341c4bf83f\"><div class=\"block__content\"><div id=\"js-dfp-tag-in_article_unit\"><script type=\"115e620bcecb056b9e6a1637-text/javascript\">\ngoogletag.display('js-dfp-tag-in_article_unit');\n</script></div></div></div><p>The <a href=\"https://www.etf.com/VIXY\"><strong>ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (VIXY)</strong></a>, which tracks short-term VIX futures and is a widely followed fear gauge, spiked nearly 10% in morning trading but retreated to +2% in afternoon trading. </p><p>Safehaven assets also jumped this morning as gold reached an all-time high, surpassing $2,800 for the first time, as funds like the <a href=\"https://www.etf.com/GLD\"><strong>SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD)</strong></a> followed the precious metal higher. </p><p><strong>For further reading: </strong><a href=\"https://www.etf.com/sections/news/trump-tariffs-best-worst-etfs\">Trump Tariffs: The Potential ETF Winners and Losers</a> </p><h2>ETHA, Crypto ETF Volatility: A Sign of What’s to Come?</h2><p>Today's seemingly overblown market reaction to new tariff announcements may offer key insights into how future market movements could unfold as trade policies evolve. Here are several takeaways: </p><h3>Market Sensitivity to Trade Policy</h3><p>The sharp drop in risk assets, including equities and cryptocurrencies, suggests that markets are highly reactive to tariff-related uncertainty. If similar tariff escalations occur, investors may continue to overcorrect in the short term before reassessing fundamentals. </p><h3>Flight to Safety &amp; Sector Rotation</h3><p>The initial selloff in risk assets and potential rebound in safe-haven assets (such as Treasuries, gold, or defensive sectors) suggests that future tariff fears could trigger similar rotations. If markets anticipate prolonged trade tensions, defensive stocks (utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare) may outperform, while trade-sensitive sectors (tech, industrials and emerging markets) could see volatility. </p><h3>Algorithmic &amp; Momentum-Driven Selling</h3><p>Today’s rapid price movements imply that algorithmic trading and momentum strategies may be amplifying volatility. Future tariff headlines could trigger knee-jerk selloffs, creating buying opportunities for long-term investors if fundamentals remain intact. </p><h3>Inflation &amp; Interest Rate Expectations</h3><p>If tariffs persist and contribute to higher consumer prices, the market may adjust its expectations for Fed policy. A strong reaction today could hint at increased market sensitivity to inflation surprises, impacting bond yields and rate-cut expectations. </p><p>Today’s wild market swings suggest that future tariff developments could lead to repeated bouts of volatility, creating short-term uncertainty but also tactical buying opportunities. Investors should monitor sentiment-driven overreactions for potential buying opportunities in fundamentally strong assets. </p><p><em>Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

The <a href=\"/voo\"><strong>Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO)</strong></a> is on the cusp of becoming the world's largest ETF, in part because its fees are one-third of its larger—for now—rival, the <a href=\"/spy\"><strong>SPDR ETF 500 Trust (SPY)</strong></a>. Investors focus on costs eating into returns, particularly as higher interest rates create opportunities in fixed-income markets. For long-term investors, even small reductions in fees can translate into thousands of dollars in savings over time through compounding returns.</p><p>CEO Salim Ramji is slashing the fees barely seven months after assuming the helm of the company, which manages $2.64 trillion—second to BlackRock Inc.—in 86 ETFs.</p><p>“Lower costs enable investors to keep more of their returns, and those savings compound over time,” Ramji said in the release.</p><div class=\"block--dfp text-center block block--dfp-ad39df3d1c-8e04-4acd-9bc3-71341c4bf83f\"><div class=\"block__content\"><div id=\"js-dfp-tag-in_article_unit\"><script type=\"9614c78a592a27766074d65a-text/javascript\">\ngoogletag.display('js-dfp-tag-in_article_unit');\n</script></div></div></div><p>Within fixed income, Vanguard's actively managed bond funds now carry a weighted-average expense ratio of 0.10%, compared to the industry average of 0.53% for active funds from other firms, according to Vanguard.

            "description": "<div class=\"etf_articles__body\"><p>A big day for earnings led to some interesting moves for tech stocks and the ETFs that hold them Thursday.<br/><br/><a href=\"/stock/META\">Meta Platforms Inc.</a>, <a href=\"/stock/MSFT\">Microsoft Corp.</a>, and <a href=\"/stock/TSLA\">Tesla Inc.</a> all reported quarterly earnings results after the bell Wednesday, leading to sharp reactions to not only their own stocks but shares of other big tech companies like <a href=\"/stock/nvda\">Nvidia Corp.</a> and <a href=\"/stock/avgo\">Broadcom Inc.</a> as well.<br/><br/>The <a href=\"/spy\"><strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)</strong></a> and the <a href=\"/qqq\"><strong>Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)</strong></a> were last trading up by 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively, reflecting the generally positive tone of the earnings releases.</p><h2>Tesla Gains on Robotaxi Talk<strong> </strong></h2><p>The biggest gainer among the reporting companies, however, was Tesla, which rose more than 3% on the day.<br/><br/>The automaker reported lackluster revenue and earnings numbers for the fourth quarter, missing on both the top and bottom lines. But investors didn’t seem to care as they focused on CEO Elon Musk’s bullish comments about the future. <br/><br/>According to Musk, Tesla plans to launch a fully autonomous taxi service in Austin, Texas in June, and the company will build 10,000 humanoid robots this year.<br/><br/>If Tesla is successful in these futuristic endeavors, Tesla could be worth “more than the next top five companies combined,” Musk predicted.<br/><br/>The bullish talk fueled enthusiasm among Tesla stockholders, helping them forget about the disappointing fourth-quarter results for Tesla’s current core electric vehicle business. </p><h2>Meta Pops, Microsoft Drops </h2><p>Not to be outdone, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made some bold predictions of his own, saying that 2025 could be the year his company builds “an AI engineering agent that has coding and problem-solving abilities of around a good mid-level engineer.\"<br/><br/>Shares of Meta climbed 2% Thursday thanks to Zuckerberg's excitement about the future, as well as strong earnings results for Q4.<br/><br/>On the other hand, shares of Microsoft tumbled more than 6% as growth in the company’s cloud computing business came in lower than some investors had hoped.  <br/><br/>“Azure growth of 31% was at the low end of guidance, with some impact from execution challenges in the broad partner channel. The issues appear fixable, though will impact revenue in the coming quarters,” analysts at Bank of America wrote in a report.</p><h2>Nvidia and Broadcom Diverge</h2><p>While Tesla, Meta and Microsoft were the companies reporting earnings this week, their results and accompanying management commentary had a big impact on shares of semiconductor companies like Nvidia and Broadcom.<br/><br/>Chip investors paid close attention to forecasts concerning how much money would be spent on capital expenditures, and in particular, AI data centers.<br/><br/>Both Microsoft and Meta indicated that spending on AI investments would continue to be strong, however, Microsoft hinted that growth would slow next year.<br/><br/>At the same time, Meta suggested that it could utilize its own custom AI chips in place of Nvidia GPUs for some workloads. The news shook Nvidia, which dropped 3% on Thursday, while Broadcom, a partner in Meta’s custom silicon efforts, rose by 5%.</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"etf_articles__body\"><p>With so much focus on the driving forces behind the massive growth of the <a href=\"/VOO\"><strong>Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO)</strong></a><strong> </strong>and its battle with the<a href=\"/SPY\"><strong> SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)</strong></a><strong> </strong>to claim the title of world's largest exchange-traded fund, it might be easy to overlook the <a href=\"/SPLG\"><strong>SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPLG)</strong></a>.</p><p>With a value of approximately $58 billion, SPLG could only be described as small if compared to the two $600 billion-plus ETFs vying for the top spot.</p><p>But against that backdrop, <a href=\"https://www.etf.com/\">etf.com</a> data reveals that SPLG stands out as leading both VOO and SPY when it comes to relative fund flows.</p><p>The <a href=\"/tools/etf-pulse\">etf.com Pulse Tool</a> shows that since the start of the year, when VOO began narrowing the gap between SPY, SPLG has experienced more than $3 million worth of inflows, which equals 0.0052% of the ETF’s assets.</p><p>By comparison, VOO’s nearly $21 billion worth of inflows represents 0.0034% of the ETF’s assets. Meanwhile, the $630 billion SPY has experienced $8.2 billion worth of outflows this month.</p><h2>How SPLG Stacks Up Against VOO, SPY</h2><div class=\"block--dfp text-center block block--dfp-ad39df3d1c-8e04-4acd-9bc3-71341c4bf83f\"><div class=\"block__content\"><div id=\"js-dfp-tag-in_article_unit\"><script type=\"7f7a39184e714aefb92d468f-text/javascript\">\ngoogletag.display('js-dfp-tag-in_article_unit');\n</script></div></div></div><p>Based purely on inflows this year, SPLG ranks fourth among all ETFs in the etf.com database, behind VOO, the $471 billion <a href=\"/VTI\"><strong>Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)</strong></a> with $3.8 million worth of inflows, and the $326 billion <a href=\"/QQQ\"><strong>Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)</strong></a>, which has garnered $3.2 million worth of inflows.</p><p>However, on a percentage-of-assets basis, SPLG tops the inflow leaders.</p><p>It is difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for SPLG’s surging popularity among investors, but it is safe to assume fees play a part. And once fees join the conversation, one must assume financial advisors are behind a good portion of the asset movement.</p><p>Still, there are a <a href=\"/sections/features/voo-vs-spy-looking-beyond-fees-find-value\">few nuances</a> to explain the ongoing appeal of SPY, which charges nine basis points, even when stacked up against VOO charging three basis points.</p><p>“It’s simple; you use SPY if you’re looking for an option strategy, because SPY has a more robust options market, and you use VOO if you’re simply looking for S&amp;P 500 exposure,” said Chuck Failla, principal at Sovereign Financial Group in Stamford, Connecticut. </p><p>But even beyond the options factor, which would make SPY the more attractive ETF for larger institutions and sophisticated traders, VOO holds an edge for its structure as an open-end ETF.</p><p>Unlike SPY, structured as a Unit Investment Trust, VOO’s structure allows for more immediate reinvestment of dividends, which presumably provides a slight compounding advantage. Thus, VOO is courting the types of financial advisors who are working with individual investors with long-term objectives.</p><p>And that brings us back to SPLG, which is also an open-end ETF, but the expense ratio comes in even lower than VOO at just two basis points.</p><p>In essence, while all eyes are fixated on the heated race between VOO and SPY, SPLG is still far back in the pack, but certainly coming on strong for all the right reasons.</p></div>",
