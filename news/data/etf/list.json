This, in turn, provided a temporary boost to investor confidence. </p><p>Following the initial decline, the <a href=\"https://www.etf.com/IBIT\"><strong>iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT)</strong></a> climbed back to the green, rising more than 7% off its morning low. </p><p>The imposition of 25% tariffs on Mexican and most Canadian imports, along with a 10% tariff on Chinese goods, has heightened fears of a trade war, leading investors to retreat from riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. Analysts suggest that these trade policies could fuel volatility across various markets, with cryptocurrencies being particularly affected due to their speculative nature.  </p><div class=\"block--dfp text-center block block--dfp-ad39df3d1c-8e04-4acd-9bc3-71341c4bf83f\"><div class=\"block__content\"><div id=\"js-dfp-tag-in_article_unit\"><script type=\"115e620bcecb056b9e6a1637-text/javascript\">\ngoogletag.display('js-dfp-tag-in_article_unit');\n</script></div></div></div><p>The <a href=\"https://www.etf.com/VIXY\"><strong>ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (VIXY)</strong></a>, which tracks short-term VIX futures and is a widely followed fear gauge, spiked nearly 10% in morning trading but retreated to +2% in afternoon trading. </p><p>Safehaven assets also jumped this morning as gold reached an all-time high, surpassing $2,800 for the first time, as funds like the <a href=\"https://www.etf.com/GLD\"><strong>SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD)</strong></a> followed the precious metal higher. </p><p><strong>For further reading: </strong><a href=\"https://www.etf.com/sections/news/trump-tariffs-best-worst-etfs\">Trump Tariffs: The Potential ETF Winners and Losers</a> </p><h2>ETHA, Crypto ETF Volatility: A Sign of What’s to Come?</h2><p>Today's seemingly overblown market reaction to new tariff announcements may offer key insights into how future market movements could unfold as trade policies evolve. Here are several takeaways: </p><h3>Market Sensitivity to Trade Policy</h3><p>The sharp drop in risk assets, including equities and cryptocurrencies, suggests that markets are highly reactive to tariff-related uncertainty. If similar tariff escalations occur, investors may continue to overcorrect in the short term before reassessing fundamentals. </p><h3>Flight to Safety &amp; Sector Rotation</h3><p>The initial selloff in risk assets and potential rebound in safe-haven assets (such as Treasuries, gold, or defensive sectors) suggests that future tariff fears could trigger similar rotations. If markets anticipate prolonged trade tensions, defensive stocks (utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare) may outperform, while trade-sensitive sectors (tech, industrials and emerging markets) could see volatility. </p><h3>Algorithmic &amp; Momentum-Driven Selling</h3><p>Today’s rapid price movements imply that algorithmic trading and momentum strategies may be amplifying volatility. Future tariff headlines could trigger knee-jerk selloffs, creating buying opportunities for long-term investors if fundamentals remain intact. </p><h3>Inflation &amp; Interest Rate Expectations</h3><p>If tariffs persist and contribute to higher consumer prices, the market may adjust its expectations for Fed policy. A strong reaction today could hint at increased market sensitivity to inflation surprises, impacting bond yields and rate-cut expectations. </p><p>Today’s wild market swings suggest that future tariff developments could lead to repeated bouts of volatility, creating short-term uncertainty but also tactical buying opportunities. Investors should monitor sentiment-driven overreactions for potential buying opportunities in fundamentally strong assets. </p><p><em>Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

The reductions affect both active and passive strategies, Malvern, Pennsylvania-based Vanguard said in the statement.</p><p>Fee battles are a long-standing feature of the exchange-traded fund industry. The <a href=\"/voo\"><strong>Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO)</strong></a> is on the cusp of becoming the world's largest ETF, in part because its fees are one-third of its larger—for now—rival, the <a href=\"/spy\"><strong>SPDR ETF 500 Trust (SPY)</strong></a>. Investors focus on costs eating into returns, particularly as higher interest rates create opportunities in fixed-income markets. For long-term investors, even small reductions in fees can translate into thousands of dollars in savings over time through compounding returns.</p><p>CEO Salim Ramji is slashing the fees barely seven months after assuming the helm of the company, which manages $2.64 trillion—second to BlackRock Inc.—in 86 ETFs.</p><p>“Lower costs enable investors to keep more of their returns, and those savings compound over time,” Ramji said in the release.</p><div class=\"block--dfp text-center block block--dfp-ad39df3d1c-8e04-4acd-9bc3-71341c4bf83f\"><div class=\"block__content\"><div id=\"js-dfp-tag-in_article_unit\"><script type=\"9614c78a592a27766074d65a-text/javascript\">\ngoogletag.display('js-dfp-tag-in_article_unit');\n</script></div></div></div><p>Within fixed income, Vanguard's actively managed bond funds now carry a weighted-average expense ratio of 0.10%, compared to the industry average of 0.53% for active funds from other firms, according to Vanguard. The firm's bond index funds feature a weighted-average expense ratio of 0.05%, less than half the competitor average of 0.11%.</p><h2>Fixed Income Fees</h2><p>The timing of these fee reductions may prove helpful for for bond investors, as yields are expected to stabilize at higher levels than seen in the past 15 years, Greg Davis, Vanguard president and chief investment officer, said in the statement.</p><p>The company said 91% of its active bond funds and ETFs have outperformed their peer group average over the past decade.</p><p>The expense ratio reductions span across U.S. equity, international equity, and money market funds as well, with changes effective immediately, the company said.</p><p>Vanguard exchange-traded funds carrry an average expense ratio of 0.09%, according to etf.com data.

That essentially serves as the active part of ONEZ, which has an expense ratio of 0.98%.</p><p>According to Michael Loukas, TrueMark principal and chief executive, ONEZ will typically allocate between 85% and 90% of the assets across the suite of buffered ETFs, which include some downside protection but no upside performance caps.</p><p>The remaining 10% to 15% of portfolio assets will be allocated to the hedged ETFs, which each include 100% downside principal protection, meaning the hedged component doesn’t alter the risk profile of ONEZ.</p><p>While TrueShares' new ETF has \"buffered\" in the name, it distinguishes itself from traditional buffered ETFs in that it functions as a laddered fund of underlying buffered ETFs.</p><p>“These are funds of funds that hold defined outcome products, but there is no defined outcome,” Loukas said. “With the laddered strategy, the buffer goes out the window and it’s just a plain old volatility-managed strategy.”</p><p>Even though ONEZ, along with all TrueMark ETFs, has no upside cap, Loukas said the ETF is not designed to track the broad markets 100%.</p><p>“All of our products are uncapped, but they have a participation rate, which means they will capture about 75% to 80% of upside,” he said. “This is squarely in the volatility managed category; if you’re bullish to the moon, just go straight into equities.”</p></div>",

Meanwhile, the $630 billion SPY has experienced $8.2 billion worth of outflows this month.</p><h2>How SPLG Stacks Up Against VOO, SPY</h2><div class=\"block--dfp text-center block block--dfp-ad39df3d1c-8e04-4acd-9bc3-71341c4bf83f\"><div class=\"block__content\"><div id=\"js-dfp-tag-in_article_unit\"><script type=\"7f7a39184e714aefb92d468f-text/javascript\">\ngoogletag.display('js-dfp-tag-in_article_unit');\n</script></div></div></div><p>Based purely on inflows this year, SPLG ranks fourth among all ETFs in the etf.com database, behind VOO, the $471 billion <a href=\"/VTI\"><strong>Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)</strong></a> with $3.8 million worth of inflows, and the $326 billion <a href=\"/QQQ\"><strong>Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)</strong></a>, which has garnered $3.2 million worth of inflows.</p><p>However, on a percentage-of-assets basis, SPLG tops the inflow leaders.</p><p>It is difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for SPLG’s surging popularity among investors, but it is safe to assume fees play a part. And once fees join the conversation, one must assume financial advisors are behind a good portion of the asset movement.</p><p>Still, there are a <a href=\"/sections/features/voo-vs-spy-looking-beyond-fees-find-value\">few nuances</a> to explain the ongoing appeal of SPY, which charges nine basis points, even when stacked up against VOO charging three basis points.</p><p>“It’s simple; you use SPY if you’re looking for an option strategy, because SPY has a more robust options market, and you use VOO if you’re simply looking for S&amp;P 500 exposure,” said Chuck Failla, principal at Sovereign Financial Group in Stamford, Connecticut. </p><p>But even beyond the options factor, which would make SPY the more attractive ETF for larger institutions and sophisticated traders, VOO holds an edge for its structure as an open-end ETF.</p><p>Unlike SPY, structured as a Unit Investment Trust, VOO’s structure allows for more immediate reinvestment of dividends, which presumably provides a slight compounding advantage. Thus, VOO is courting the types of financial advisors who are working with individual investors with long-term objectives.</p><p>And that brings us back to SPLG, which is also an open-end ETF, but the expense ratio comes in even lower than VOO at just two basis points.</p><p>In essence, while all eyes are fixated on the heated race between VOO and SPY, SPLG is still far back in the pack, but certainly coming on strong for all the right reasons.</p></div>",
