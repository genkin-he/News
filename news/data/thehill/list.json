Trump has long sought to wipe the Department of Education (DOE) from the federal government, and, responding to one of those reports, Elon Musk said he “will succeed” where other conservatives have failed.  </p>\n\n<p>“The whole thing is absurd,” said Jon Valant, director of the Brown Center on Education Policy at the Brookings Institute, of the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5123000-education-department-dei-trump/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">staffers placed on leave</a>. </p>\n<p>While it was pinned to Trump’s anti-diversity efforts, the DOE push to forced leave “feels much more connected to” reports that Trump is looking at executive actions to weaken the department, Valant said.  </p>\n<p>“I think they are trying to squeeze the department in any way they can, to try to encourage people to leave, force people to leave, do whatever they can to shrink, destabilize and kneecap the department, knowing full well that they can’t just outright eliminate it or most of its major programs and offices without the cooperation of Congress,” he added.  </p>\n<p><a data-id=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/education-department-trump-executive-order-eeaf1cb6?mod=hp_lead_pos2\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/education-department-trump-executive-order-eeaf1cb6?mod=hp_lead_pos2\">The Wall Street Journal reported</a> Monday that Trump is looking at executive actions to cripple the Education Department, such as taking away programs not explicitly written into law, moving functions to different departments and calling for Congress to pass a law completely abolishing the federal agency.  </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Multiple people familiar with the conversations told the outlet the specifics and timing are still up for debate and the president is facing pressure from others to wait on any such orders until after the confirmation hearing for Trump’s pick for Education secretary, which has not been scheduled yet.  </p>\n<p>“I think this is going to change the conversation in Linda McMahon’s confirmation hearings,” Valant said. “Regardless, we were going to see a good amount of questioning around the future of the department. I think that looks now like it’s probably going to be the dominant part of that conversation.”</p>\n\n<p>Trump made clear in the Oval Office on Tuesday that he wants “Linda to put herself out of a job.”</p>\n<p>“I told Linda, ‘Linda, I hope you do a great job and put yourself out of a job,'” Trump said, adding he would like to end the department through executive order.</p>\n<p>“So we’re ranked number 40 out of 40 schools, right? We’re ranked number one in cost per pupil, so we spend more per pupil than any other country in the world, and we’re ranked at the bottom of the list. We’re ranked very badly. And what I want to do is let the states run schools,” the president added.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>While Trump had promised to dismantle the department in his first administration, he made little effort to keep that pledge at the time.  </p>\n<p>The tone has shifted dramatically in his second term, with Musk, the head of the unofficial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that is <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5123000-education-department-dei-trump/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">currently gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)</a> and going through other departments, confident in Trump’s efforts.  </p>\n<p>“Reagan campaigned on ending the federal Dept of Education, which was created by Carter in 1979, but it was bigger when Reagan left office than when he started!” Musk <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5125069-department-of-education-trump-musk-doge/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said in response</a> to <a data-id=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/03/trump-education-department-dismantling-executive-order-draft/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/03/trump-education-department-dismantling-executive-order-draft/\">a report from The Washington Post</a> about Trump’s potential executive actions and DOGE going through data from the federal agency. </p>\n\n<p>“Not this time. President @realDonaldTrump will succeed,” he added.  </p>\n<p>Eliminating the department would require legislative action, as some of the programs are written into law, but there are significant ways the president could weaken it, such as abolishing others, cutting down personnel, investigating programs, shifting funding or moving programs to other federal departments.  </p>\n<p>“He can’t really do a whole lot. You can’t eliminate Title I. He can’t eliminate the [Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]. There are lots of other things that he can’t just stop,” said Neil McCluskey, director for the Center for Educational Freedom at CATO Institute.        </p>\n\n<p>“I think that it’s probably within his executive power: not to eliminate the programs, but to examine them and see how they work and whether or not they’re working properly. And I imagine that will be part of the executive order,” McCluskey added. </p>\n<p>When asked about potential executive action, a White House official told The Hill that Trump “plans to fulfill a campaign promise by revaluating the future of the Department of Education.” </p>\n<p>On Friday, DOE sent letters to dozens of staffers putting them on administrative leave due to executive action Trump signed to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs from the federal government.  </p>\n\n<p>The union for the staffers said many of the targeted employees had no direct involvement in DEI but attended a DEI program back in 2019 during Trump’s first term in office that was encouraged by his then-secretary of education.  </p>\n<p>“President Trump was elected to bring about unprecedented reform to the federal civil service to ensure it is merit-based and efficient at serving the interests of the American people. At the Department of Education, we are evaluating staffing in line with the commitment to prioritizing meaningful learning ahead of divisive ideology in schools and putting student outcomes above special interests,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Communications Madi Biedermann when asked for comment about the potential executive actions by the president and placing staff on administrative leave.  </p>\n<p>Eliminating the department altogether is an idea that certainly does have its defenders on Capitol Hill.</p>\n\n<p>“To my friends who are upset, I would say with respect, call somebody who cares. You better get used to this. It’s USAID today, it’s going to be the Department of Education tomorrow,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said on Fox News this week.</p>\n<p>Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) reintroduced a bill this month in the House to eliminate DOE. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) introduced a bill with the same goal in the Senate back in November. </p>\n<p>But such a measure would have to not only clear the House, where Republicans have a razor-thin majority, also secure 60 votes in the Senate to beat a filibuster. And no Democrat in the 53-47 upper chamber has backed the idea. </p>\n\n<p>McCluskey said even more “palatable” arguments such as not eliminating DOE functions but just moving them elsewhere would “still be a tough haul, because you’d have to get Democrats.” </p>\n<p>If none of Trump’s reforms get congressional approval, advocates are concerned about the political ping-pong that could develop with the agency. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>Schools have already experienced political whiplash with <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5118925-trump-biden-title-ix-education-gender-lgbtq/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Title IX regulations</a>, having to change how they handle sexual assault cases and discrimination protections for LGBTQ students back and forth between Trump and former President Biden. </p>\n<p>“What worries me here is that we’re sort of headed down a path where we’re going to have this pendulum swing in a lot of different parts of what the federal government does when it comes to education, and I don’t think that serves anyone well and I also don’t think anyone really wants that,” Valant said.  </p>\n<p>“I don’t think there’s much appetite for having these major, major changes to the federal role in education every time we move from a Republican to a Democratic administration and back,” he added. </p>\n</div>",

A hold on arms sales to Israel signals a major flouting of convention, where U.S. military support for Israel is viewed as an investment in American national security.   </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/u-s-readies-new-1-billion-arms-sale-to-israel-6832aa26\">Wall Street Journal reported</a> that the $1 billion arms sale package for Israel includes 4,700 1,000-pound bombs, worth more than $700 million, as well as armored bulldozers built by Caterpillar, worth more than $300 million, citing U.S. officials. </p>\n<p>The hold comes as Democrats <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5119639-democrats-frustration-trump-agenda/\">have seethed</a> over Trump’s actions a little over two weeks into his presidency. They pushed back on an initial federal aid freeze; are <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5116538-senate-democrats-oppose-trump-agenda/\">condemning a halt</a> on U.S. foreign assistance; <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5123663-democrats-blocked-entry-usaid/\">raising alarm</a> over the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID); and opposing the president’s threats of tariffs on America’s neighbors Mexico and Canada, to name a few of the high profile conflicts. </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>But there’s few options for Democrats to push back on Trump’s agenda absent Republican allies given the GOP’s slim majorities in the House and Senate. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5123870-schatz-trump-state-department-hold-usaid/\">have announced</a> they will delay and stall Trump’s State Department nominees until the administration retreats on its efforts to break up USAID. </p>\n<p>Trump could try and override the Israeli arms sale hold. In 2019, Trump issued an emergency declaration to push through more than $8 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan without congressional approval. The Republican-controlled Senate at the time <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/saudi-arabia-arms-deal-trump-what-to-know/\">voted to block</a> the arms sale. </p>\n\n<p>Arms sales to Israel are historically bipartisan, even as Democrats have increasingly raised alarm over Israel’s war conduct in the Gaza Strip and Netanyahu’s policies toward Palestinians. </p>\n<p>Amid Israel’s war against Hamas in response to the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack, an estimated half of the nearly 47,000 Palestinian casualties are women, children and the elderly. Nearly all of the two million Gaza residents require humanitarian assistance and 90 percent are displaced among widespread destruction. </p>\n<p>Still, Democrats in positions of power did not stand in the way of President Biden sending weapons to Israel or green-lighting arms sales. In June, Biden <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4727080-top-democrats-gregory-meeks-ben-cardin-israel-hamas-war-massive-weapons-package/\">moved forward</a> on a $18 billion arms sale to Israel. </p>\n<p>Netanyahu will meet with Trump at the White House on Tuesday and is expected to visit Capitol Hill and meet with lawmakers on Wednesday. </p>\n<p>The U.S. provides about $38 billion to Israel as part of a 10-year memorandum of understanding (MOU). That amounts to $3.3 billion in foreign military financing — generally a credit for Israel to purchase weapons systems in the U.S. and $500 million for missile defense programs annually. The MOU runs through fiscal year 2028 and will need to be renewed in 2029. </p>\n</div>",

When you take those things out, you are undermining the ability of the government … and you are ensuring that there is discrimination, that there is unfairness, that there is inequality,” Andrea Abrams, executive director of American Pride Rises (APR), told The Hill.</p>\n<p>Trump and Republicans have argued DEI is a discriminatory practice that wrongfully employs minorities while overlooking qualified candidates. </p>\n<p>In his inauguration speech, Trump said his administration would “forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based.” He doubled down on this in his executive orders, where he labeled “so-called” DEI programs “dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences.”</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Advocates have pushed back on such assertions, instead saying the role of DEI is to help hedge discriminatory practices and outcomes toward protected communities noted under equal employment opportunity policies.</p>\n<p>“The objective of these programs is to try and mitigate some of the still rampant, ongoing discrimination that’s faced by people from certain communities,” said Dante King, an author and DEI proponent.</p>\n\n<p>King added that the backlash to DEI, though years in the making, stems from the last decade of gains Black Americans have witnessed, including the elections of former President Obama and Vice President Harris and the appointment of Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. </p>\n<p>“I think that there is a lot of white backlash because who we see as once being enslaved have been able to ascend to a position of influence and prominence, to be able to hold this white man — this famous, very rich, wealthy white man — accountable,” King said. “Black people were brought here as subjects of America, and it was never intended that we would hold any other types of positions. And so one of the things that I’ve been saying is that white people are okay with the racial diversity as long as it is in the context of subjugation and inferiority.”</p>\n<p>Advocates often point to <a href=\"https://dei360.org/diversity-as-a-revenue-engine-what-16-studies-reveal/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">numerous studies that have</a> shown that companies profit from DEI programs both culturally and economically.  They have also been working to remind employers that Trump’s orders cannot supersede federal law. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>As advocates work to spread this message, they’ve also stepped up their legal challenges to Trump. </p>\n<p>On Monday, groups representing university diversity officers and professors, restaurant workers and Baltimore city officials filed a lawsuit against Trump and multiple federal agencies in the US District Court for the District of Maryland.</p>\n<p>The suit claims Trump’s order is too vague and threatens First Amendment and due process rights. </p>\n\n<p>“These executive orders are political theater, but they’re also really dangerous because they attempt to undermine existing law,” said Alphonso David, president and CEO of the Global Black Economic Forum. </p>\n<p>Trump, he added, “is trying to redefine race and its troubled relationship with this country, and he’s trying to ignore that systemic discrimination exists.”</p>\n<p>The White House defended its approach to DEI in a statement.</p>\n\n<p>“Minorities in America have recognized the Democrat Party’s empty promises and failed policies,” said Harrison Fields, principal deputy press secretary at the White House. “That’s why President Trump earned historic support from Black, Latino, Asian, and Arab Americans by prioritizing secure borders, economic opportunity, and an America First foreign policy. Meanwhile, the Left’s divisive focus on DEI policies undermines decades of progress toward true equality. The Trump administration rejects this backward thinking and will pursue an agenda that lifts everyone up with the chance to achieve the American Dream.”</p>\n<p>Davids said legislators must focus on strengthening those laws rather than introducing new bills.</p>\n<p>“This is not about advancing new policies. This is about complying with existing ones,” he said, emphasizing that it is still illegal for employers to discriminate on the basis of race, sex, ethnicity or disability. </p>\n\n<p>But lawmakers have to make sure their work is reaching more than just the streets of D.C., said democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright.</p>\n<p>“I think it will be malpractice to centralize this fight geographically to Washington,” said Seawright. Instead, he said, legislators have to make sure they’re educating Americans around the nation of the work they are doing, especially as 2026 midterm campaigning gets underway.</p>\n<p>“Throughout our history, particularly as Black Americans, Washington has never been the only battlefield we’ve had to fight on,” Seawright said. “We have to hyper-localize these discussions and fights because they’re taking place not just in Washington but all over the country.”</p>\n\n<p>Seawright added that the work to protect DEI cannot rest only upon Black legislators, such as the Congressional Black Caucus, if Democrats want to ensure change. </p>\n<p>“The CBC has always been on the front line pushing the envelope for change, so that won’t change, but we have to be careful making this just a CBC fight, because CBC represents more than just Black Americans, they represent all Americans from all walks of life,” Seawright said. </p>\n<p>“This has to be a broader fight. I think the CBC, the CHC and the Asian American Pacific Islander caucus, and every other community caucus has just as much of a responsibility to lead the fight on this.” </p>\n\n<p>In some ways, Seawright added, Republicans have to stand up to the president as well. </p>\n<p>“This impacts all of us, because every American has benefited in some way, shape or form, from the fertilization of diversity, equity and inclusion to the American soil,” said Seawright. </p>\n<p>Abrams, of APR, added that corporations have to take a stance as well.</p>\n<p>Meta, McDonalds, Walmart, Lowe’s and Target are all among a plethora of corporations to announce they would no longer continue their DEI programs.</p>\n<p>“They want to back down publicly while continuing to do these things quietly, because they know it works,” Abrams said. “We need to demand that these corporations stop trying to have it both ways, stop trying to continue to benefit from DEI behind closed doors. If you’re going to benefit from, then you have a responsibility to stand up in this moment and not to be bullied.”</p>\n<p>It will fall on consumers rather than politicians, Abrams added, to hold these corporations accountable. </p>\n<p>“This is not a moment where we need to panic and feel overwhelmed, but we have to remember what has come before, where we are right now, how much power we actually do have,” Abrams said. </p>\n</div>",

It is something that … that I had not been notified about. But again, this is just foreign relations and appropriations,” he said. “And I would not necessarily have been notified. But we check again. Things are happening fast. And we’re we’re going to find out a lot more. There’s good communication.”</p>\n<p>“And I would not necessarily have been notified. But we check again.
