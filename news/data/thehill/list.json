Even though she had good insurance, Cheryl owed more than $25,000 out of pocket. Inundated with bills, she called the hospital, confirmed the total she owed and worked out a payment plan with them.</p>\n<p>“The whole mess was exhausting but I was willing to throw money at people to make it go away,” Cheryl told me. “We had to use credit cards to pay it, which I’m still paying off now.”</p>\n\n<p>But almost two years after Cheryl’s health scare, the unthinkable happened. She received a call from a debt collector demanding payment for an outstanding physician bill relating to her hospital stay. Cheryl called the hospital and her insurance company to determine if she even owed this additional bill.</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, still waiting for an answer, she received an email from her identity theft service saying she had a “major derogatory account.” The debt collectors had reported the disputed bill to the credit bureaus, causing Cheryl’s credit score to drop by 60 points.</p>\n<p>“I am willing to pay them what I would have owed,” she said. “I did pay my debts related to that visit and I don’t think I’m trying to get away with something sneaky here. I don’t think it’s right that they used my credit score to punish me when I wouldn’t pay them $1,700 without explanation. It felt like extortion.”</p>\n<p>These kinds of anecdotes prompted the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to issue <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-finalizes-rule-to-remove-medical-bills-from-credit-reports/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a final rule</a> in the final days of the Biden administration that will eliminate medical debt from credit reports sent to lenders. The rule should go into effect in mid-March, but it may never provide relief to those it is intended to protect. The credit-reporting industry and third-party collectors both immediately filed <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinancemonitor.com/2025/01/10/cfpb-issues-long-awaited-medical-debt-rule-regulation-immediately-challenged-in-federal-court/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">lawsuits</a> to block the rule.

In addition, many families face large bills after a sudden health care need and large out-of-pocket amounts they can’t pay within the 90 days required by providers.</p>\n<p>Legitimate or not, reports of unpaid debt can tank an otherwise strong credit score. The new rule would change that for about <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-finalizes-rule-to-remove-medical-bills-from-credit-reports/#:~:text=CFPB%20Finalizes%20Rule%20to%20Remove%20Medical%20Bills%20from%20Credit%20Reports,-English&amp;text=WASHINGTON%2C%20D.C.%20%E2%80%93%20Today%2C%20the,of%20about%2015%20million%20Americans.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">15 million Americans</a> with medical debt on their credit reports.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s how the new rule works: Owed medical bills will still appear on people’s credit reports, where landlords or employers who request a copy can see it. But when a potential lender requests a credit report, the reporting company (usually Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) will be required to exclude bills owed to health care providers.</p>\n<p>Unlike debt resulting from irresponsible spending, medical bills generally are unavoidable. <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-study-finds-medical-debt-overly-penalizes-consumer-credit-scores/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">One report showed</a> that medical debt does not indicate a person’s desire or willingness to pay off loans.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pirg.org/edfund/articles/why-medical-debt-should-be-removed-from-credit-reports/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">My organization agrees</a> with the CFPB: Credit reports should treat medical bills differently.

He served as acting NOAA administrator from 2020 to 2021 and was nominated as the full-time administrator in 2020, but never received a full Senate vote. </p>\n\n<p>In September 2019, after Trump apparently used a Sharpie to alter the path of Hurricane Dorian on a map to depict Alabama in its path, Jacobs was involved in drafting a NOAA statement backing Trump’s projection.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) expressed concern that President Trump is “stumbling into a trade war” by <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5121102-trump-tariffs-china-canada-mexico/\">imposing additional tariffs</a> on China and accused him of holding up “critical” bipartisan investments. </p>\n<p>“Tariffs are a tool to help strategically grow American industry. I’m concerned that President Trump is stumbling into a trade war that isn’t designed to protect American jobs or industry while giving corporations cover to raise prices on working families,” Warren said in a Tuesday statement. </p>\n\n<p>Trump <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5121102-trump-tariffs-china-canada-mexico/\">signed sweeping tariffs</a> against the U.S.’s top three trading partners: China, Mexico and Canada on Saturday. Those levied against Canada and Mexico were 25 percent. Ones against China were set at 10 percent. The president said both Mexico and Canada need to provide greater enforcement at their borders and help curb the flow of illegal drugs coming across. </p>\n<p>After speaking with leaders of both Mexico and Canada, Trump <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5124026-trump-trudeau-canada-tariff-delay/\">called off</a> the enforcement of tariffs for 30 days. Those against Beijing went into effect just past midnight on Tuesday. </p>\n<p>China <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5124874-china-united-states-retaliatory-tariffs/\">retaliated</a> on Tuesday, slapping a 15 percent tariff on liquefied natural gas and coal. Another 10 percent was added to agricultural machinery, pickup trucks and crude oil. The country is also set to implement export controls on tellurium, bismuth, tungsten, indium and molybdenum, all important elements. </p>\n<p>The country’s Administration for Market Regulation <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5124874-china-united-states-retaliatory-tariffs/\">said</a> it will kick off an antitrust investigation into Google, although the company’s search engine does not operate there. </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Warren said on Tuesday that Trump is also stalling tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act that, she says, “would eliminate China’s leverage over our critical mineral supply chains.” </p>\n<p>“On top of that, the President is holding up critical bipartisan investments to shore up our energy security and is attempting to gut the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits that would eliminate China’s leverage over our critical mineral supply chains,” Warren said. “Beijing understands that and is exploiting our weakness.” </p>\n\n<p>The Massachusetts senator, who at times <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5104016-warren-sends-musk-30-ideas-for-doge-to-cut-government-spending/\">looked</a> to find common ground with some of Trump’s allies, also stated the president has not fortified the U.S. export controls with Beijing. </p>\n<p>“In addition, the President hasn’t strengthened our export controls with China, despite having concrete bipartisan ideas, like those Senator Hawley and I have proposed,” she said in a statement. “President Trump is focused on bluster and photo ops while China is focused on winning. Congress will conduct rigorous oversight of how the President uses tariffs as a tool, and we – and the American people – will hold him accountable.”</p>\n<p>Republican senators have largely been supportive of Trump’s tariffs. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>“We’ve got a president that wants to put America first and protect people,” Schmitt said. “We have 100,000 people a year … dying from fentanyl,” Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5121442-sen-eric-schmitt-trump-tariffs-not-a-surprise/\">said</a> on Sunday. “He ran on this. This is not a surprise. He talked about getting operational control of our border. He talked about tariffs and improving our standing in the world. He’s doing all those things.” </p>\n<p>But a few within the upper chamber’s GOP conference publicly disagreed, stating tariffs will drive the prices of consumer goods up. </p>\n<p>“It will drive the cost of everything up. In other words, it will be paid for by American consumers. I mean, why would you want to get into a fight with your allies over this,” former Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5122566-trump-economic-agenda-tariffs/\">said</a> on CBS’s “60 Minutes.” </p>\n\n<p>The Hill has reached out to the White House for comment. </p>\n</div>",

For adults over 60, the regions currently at risk for lethal heat waves are ten times higher: 20 percent of the earth’s surface.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>But if average temperatures rise to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels — or just another .5 degrees Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming — then the regions affected by lethal heat waves will spread until they have enclosed a total global area about the same size as the United States as a whole, the study found. </p>\n<p>Those impacts will be worst for parts of densely populated equatorial countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where billions of people could be at risk — even if planetary heating is kept at bay by significant shifts in how the world’s nations use energy and limits on the burning of fossil fuels, according to the study.</p>\n\n<p>If those shifts away from burning coal, oil and gas don’t happen, projections suggest that warming could exceed 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit). In that scenario, the study found, 40 percent  of the planet’s land area could feel the impacts of heat waves that adults can’t survive.</p>\n<p>In that scenario, Matthews said, only regions furthest from the equator — or at high elevation — would be unaffected. </p>\n<p>In all cases, he said, “as more of the planet experiences outdoor conditions too hot for our physiology, it will be essential that people have reliable access to cooler environments to shelter from the heat.”</p>\n<p>Such protections may require more than simply access to air conditioning. While air conditioning is nearly ubiquitous across the cities of the Southern U.S., these protections are vulnerable to disaster. During post-hurricane blackouts last July, millions of residents of Houston, Texas, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/newsletters/sustainability/4764637-houston-sweats-without-power-in-heat-wave/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sweated in the heat and dark</a> for more than a week — underscoring the overlapping dangers posed by a heating planet.</p>\n</div>",
