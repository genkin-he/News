And having watched much of the hearings about Robert Kennedy Jr.’s appointment, I’m more alarmed than I was before.</p>\n<p>RFK was <a href=\"https://www.city-journal.org/article/shake-up-hhs\">chosen to be a boat-rocker</a>. If one department is ripe for finding waste, fraud and abuse, it is HHS. It spends almost $2 trillion per year, and accounting for all of that money is nearly impossible. To take on a beast like this one, you have to be above-board with what you’re doing.</p>\n\n<p>Kennedy’s mission is to shrink; to eliminate the unnecessary and unneeded. It’s far too big a task for any one man. An effective secretary needs trustworthy staff and good judgment. And that judgment part is where I see problems for Kennedy. </p>\n<p>The arguments about his not being a doctor or an expert are empty political ploys that won’t really land. For one thing, the average person doesn’t know or care what a health policy expert is or knows. And the people to whom it matters won’t support RFK anyway, despite having backed the equally unqualified Xavier Becerra, the Biden HHS secretary who came into the job with no health care or public health background whatsoever, and then basically went missing after his confirmation.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t mean it will be smooth sailing for RFK. Democrats are desperate for at least one scalp, to show supporters they aren’t completely powerless. The list of possible scalps shrinks daily, as nominees outperform Democrats in their hearings and win over skeptical Republican Senators. RFK is one of the last bites at the apple they have left.</p>\n<p>Throughout these hearings, RFK has given a lot of ammunition to those who oppose his nomination. Instead of putting controversial positions and stances to rest, he’s exacerbated them. </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Which brings us to conflicts of interest. The thing about conflicts of interest is they don’t really have to exist in order to matter — they just have to appear to exist to have hay made out of them.</p>\n<p>Sometimes they do exist. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/08/02/joe-biden-investigation-hunter-brother-hedge-fund-money-2020-campaign-227407\">Joe Biden’s family presented an unending stream of conflicts</a>, as they made money from countries and industries they seemingly knew nothing about and then <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5095569-biden-family-pardons-oversight-committee/\">got open-ended pardons for their troubles</a>, just in case they did something illegal. Sometimes, the conflicts don’t exist, as when people pretended that foreign diplomats spending hundreds of dollars for a room at a Trump hotel would influence a presidential decisionmaking process. </p>\n\n<p>With RFK, it appears to be a lawsuit over vaccines. </p>\n<p>Gardasil is a vaccine against the human papillomavirus. Many people swear by it, and some countries claim it is <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/hpv-vaccination-world-can-eliminate-cervical-cancer\">responsible for the near-elimination of cervical cancer</a>. But nothing is universally loved, and RFK is a party to a lawsuit against its manufacturer. He stands to gain financially if the suit is successful. </p>\n<p>As HHS secretary, being party to such a lawsuit in an industry he will have influence over, he has at least the appearance of a conflict. That’s something even people who don’t pay attention can understand. Having an <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/29/warren-kennedy-hearing-vaccine-lawsuits-00201284\">argument with a senator</a> at your confirmation hearing doesn’t help. Nor does later changing your mind about the appearance of a conflict and removing yourself from the case in a way that only <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/31/congress/rfk-jr-to-revise-ethics-pledge-00201813\">confers upon your son</a> the financial stake you have in the case.  </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-less-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>RFK’s move in this regard only raises more eyebrows. In an effort to distance himself from the conflict, RFK just made it clearer that he or his family will continue to profit from suing a company he would regulate as HHS secretary — the ultimate “appearance of impropriety.” Rather than eliminate concerns, his actions have reinforced the worst preconceived notions of his potential conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>I’m no lawyer, but I do understand politics. The politics of this don’t look good. If your financial stake represents a probable conflict of interest, then you can’t solve the problem by just handing it off to someone in your family. </p>\n<p>I would like to see RFK rock the boat at HHS — he can tip it over for all I care. But he can’t do it effectively if he is hampered by conflicts of interest. If he doesn’t completely lose those conflicts, he may not get the chance to do anything. </p>\n\n<p><em>Derek Hunter is </em><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-derek-hunter-podcast/id1372929405\"><em>host of the Derek Hunter Podcast</em></a><em> and a former staffer for the late Sen.

Chesterton, described the utility of conservatives with tongue planted firmly in cheek: “The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of Conservatives is to prevent mistakes from being corrected. Even when the revolutionist might himself repent of his revolution, the traditionalist is already defending it as part of his tradition. Thus, we have two great types — the advanced person who rushes us into ruin, and the retrospective person who admires the ruins.” </p>\n<p>Progressives, Chesterton believed, are committed to change without always properly understanding its consequences. Conservatives are devoted to preserving the status quo without regard to its costs or benefits. </p>\n<p>Chesterton summarized the utility of conservatism more seriously in his paradox of the fence: “In the matter of reforming things…there is…a paradox. There exists…. let us say…a fence…The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, ‘I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.’ To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: ‘If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away…[W]hen you can…tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.” </p>\n<p>“The…fence did not grow there…Some person had some reason for thinking it would be a good thing for somebody. And until we know what the reason was, we really cannot judge whether the reason was reasonable…nobody has any business to destroy a social institution until he has really seen it as an historical institution. If he knows how it arose, and what purposes it was supposed to serve, he may really be able to say that they were bad purposes, that they have since become bad purposes, or that they are purposes which are no longer served.” </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>The aversion to change around which Chesterton constructed his parable and paradox were central to the fountainhead of American conservatism, another British thinker and politician, Edmund Burke, <a href=\"https://www.amphilsoc.org/blog/musings-manuscripts-reflecting-burkes-reflections\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">who argued</a>, “When ancient opinions and rules of life are taken away, the loss cannot possibly be estimated. From that moment, we have no compass to govern us, nor can we know distinctly to what port to steer.”  </p>\n<p>Donald Trump is not a conservative; quite the contrary, Trump is a radical revolutionary. He is not committed to Burke’s preservationist project but to overturning tradition and destroying institutions with no consideration of their history or utility.  </p>\n\n<p>Burke’s conservatism grew from his disgust at the excesses of the French Revolution. While the storming of the Bastille horrified Burke, Trump lauded the storming of the U.S. Capitol.  </p>\n<p>Nobody’s liberal, columnist <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/trump-and-the-collapse-of-the-old-order-policy-politics-eb2fe178\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Peggy Noonan underscored the reality</a>, “…the second rise of Donald Trump is a total break with the past — stable order, healthy expectations, the honoring of a certain old moderation, and strict adherence to…the law aren’t being ‘traduced’; they are ending.” </p>\n<p>In college I read a book titled “The Strange Death of Liberal England,” which argued that in the early 1900s, Britain’s parliamentary democracy was on the cusp of revolution and destruction, rescued only by World War I.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>“This is… a record,” its author wrote, “…not of great events but of little ones, which, working with the pointless industry of termites, slowly undermined England’s parliamentary structure until, but for the providential intervention of a world war, it would certainly have collapsed.” </p>\n<p>Whatever the truth about English history, the suicide of American conservatism is even stranger.  </p>\n<p>Republicans allowed a revolutionary to seize control of their party without the peaceful equivalent of firing a shot. Through myriad small events and actions, conservative leaders collaborated in their own demise and in the demolition of their own cherished philosophy.  </p>\n\n<p>To cite one example, in recent days former Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell gave public voice to his antipathy to Trump and his policies.   </p>\n<p>Yet, during Trump’s second impeachment, in the aftermath of Jan. 6, McConnell had it in his power to end Trump’s political career, to save conservatism from the dustbin of history, and refused, based on a patently absurd and historically unprecedented technicality.   </p>\n<p>Another small example: Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger did not have to be the only House Republicans to join the Jan. 6 committee.  </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n\n<p>And so on. </p>\n<p>The Republican Party lives on, but its animating ideology for most of the last hundred years is strangely dead, at the hands of, or at least with the connivence of, its leading adherents.  </p>\n<p><em>Mellman is president of The Mellman Group a political consultancy. Mellman served as pollster to Senate Democratic leaders for over 20 years.

Gen. Keith Kellogg does not yet have an overall plan to end the war in Ukraine — at least not one that President Trump is willing to support. </p>\n<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Megyn Kelly last Friday that the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42nQDD2-wbc&amp;t=404s\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Trump administration believes</a> the war has been fought to a “stalemate,” and that “it is not going to end with the maximalist goals of either” Russia or Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin disagrees. He remains dead-set on the total destruction of Ukraine and continues to insist on its <a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-january-20-2025\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">absolute submission</a>. His advisor, <a href=\"https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/01/14/ukraine-may-cease-to-exist-in-2025-putin-aide-says-a87610\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nikolai Patrushev</a>, went further: “It can’t be ruled out that Ukraine will cease to exist at all in the coming year.”</p>\n<p>The Kremlin believes time is now on its side, especially now that Trump has <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trumps-ukraine-envoy-has-a-hard-climb-to-any-peace-deal-ac728e58\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tasked Kellogg</a> with finding a negotiated solution in 100 days or less. </p>\n<p>A quick negotiated solution means ending the war on Putin’s terms. Moscow is still demanding Ukraine’s <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/5103281-putin-end-game-ukraine/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">complete capitulation</a> — territorial concessions, Ukrainian neutrality, and unilateral disarmament.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/putins-peace-plan-is-actually-a-call-for-ukraines-capitulation/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Putin is also insisting</a> that Ukraine would have to “give up its pursuit of NATO membership” and accept “extensive limitations on the size of its armed forces and on the kinds of weapons systems it is allowed to possess.” </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Each of these is a non-starter for Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Essentially, Putin is demanding Kellogg embark on an ill-advised road to a modern-day <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/yalta-conf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Yalta Conference</a>. Near the end of World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill effectively conceded Eastern Europe at Yalta to Soviet leader Josef Stalin in exchange for Stalin agreeing to fight Japan. The result? Forty-three years of the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Iron-Curtain\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Iron Curtain</a> in Europe.</p>\n\n<p>Kellogg needs to channel his inner Gen. George Patton and tell Trump that he is on a road to nowhere with Putin.</p>\n<p>The Kremlin is betting on Trump being strategically distracted in the Indo-Pacific — as Roosevelt was at the end of World War II — and getting everything he wants in Eastern Europe and in the Caucasian nations of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. Putin has made no secret about it. </p>\n<p>Russia has repeatedly rejected the Kellogg proposal to <a href=\"https://english.nv.ua/russian-war/russia-no-frozen-conflict-blames-nato-for-fueling-ukraine-war-50474790.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">freeze the war</a>. Moscow will not accept the presence of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-rejects-idea-nato-peacekeepers-ukraine-warning-uncontrollable-escalation-2025-01-23/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">European peace-keeping forces</a> in Ukraine. And despite the Ukrainian Constitution saying otherwise, Putin considers Zelensky an <a href=\"https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/01/29/putin-says-ukraine-peace-talks-possible-but-not-with-zelensky-a87775\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">illegitimate leader</a>, since his presidential term expired last year. As a consequence, he will not negotiate directly with him.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-less-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>It is therefore ill-advised for Kellogg to <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/us-urges-ukraine-to-hold-elections-after-ceasefire-trumps-envoy-tells-reuters/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">urge Ukraine</a> to hold elections after any ceasefire. Moscow is performing poorly on the battlefield but excels at election interference. Recent elections in <a href=\"https://www.usip.org/publications/2024/11/russian-interference-2024-moldovan-presidential-election-and-constitutional\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Moldova</a>, <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/a/accused-of-interference-in-georgia-russia-pumps-up-anti-us-propaganda-/7846721.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Georgia</a> and <a href=\"https://ecfr.eu/article/romanias-election-crisis-a-stark-warning-for-nato-nations-on-russian-meddling/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Romania</a> are highly dispositive, a foreshadowing of what would come. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Putin is continuing his assault on Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Over the weekend, Russia launched ballistic missiles on <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-targets-odesa-historical-center/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Odesa’s historic city center</a>, a UNESCO designated World Heritage site. Multiple historic buildings were damaged and seven people were injured. <a href=\"https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/02/1/7496315/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Norwegian diplomats</a> visiting the city narrowly escaped the strikes. In March 2024, Greek Prime Minister <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/06/europe/russia-missile-odesa-greece-russia-zelensky-intl/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kyriakos Mitsotakis</a> also avoided a missile strike in Odesa within 500 meters of his convoy.</p>\n\n<p>Kellogg, for now, is struggling to set conditions for any meaningful negotiations. Putin is clearly waiting for a face-to-face meeting with Trump in what he hopes becomes a second Yalta-like conference.</p>\n<p>Wittingly or not, Kellogg is trapped in a Monty Hall-like “Let’s Make a Deal” modus operandi of his own making — as opposed to a more forceful “this is what you are going to do” approach to Putin and his cronies in the Kremlin. This peace deal is more in the short-term interests of the U.S. and not the victim — Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Presently, Kellogg has no negotiating leverage. There are signs that may change. On Monday, Trump announced that he wants <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/trump-says-he-wants-ukraine-supply-us-with-rare-earths-2025-02-03/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ukraine to repay the U.S.</a> with rare earth minerals valued at “close to $300 billion.” Kellogg would be wise to remind Trump that parts of the illegally Russian-occupied Donbas are rich in natural resources.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/08/10/ukraine-russia-energy-mineral-wealth/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Donbas</a> “harbors some of the world’s largest reserves of titanium and iron ore, fields of untapped lithium and massive deposits of coal. Collectively, they are worth tens of trillions of dollars.” </p>\n<p>So Ukraine is more than capable of paying its way forward. It is time Kellogg reminded Putin of that reality.</p>\n<p>But Putin will only get that message to the extent that his nose is bloodied on the battlefield. He survived Biden’s “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/4717787-bidens-just-enough-strategy-in-ukraine-is-not-nearly-enough-to-defeat-putin/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">just enough</a>” war in Ukraine, and now he believes he can outlast Trump. </p>\n\n<p>Kellogg can disabuse Putin of that notion by empowering the Armed Forces of Ukraine to take the fight to the Russians, and to do so now.</p>\n<p>Russia has been severely militarily weakened. After nearly three years of war, Putin has suffered an estimated <a href=\"https://x.com/DefenceU/status/1886302598883336485\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">841,660 casualties</a> — <a href=\"https://x.com/DefenceU/status/1886375742331932680\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">48,240</a> in January alone — and combined tens of thousands of tanks, armored fighting vehicles, artillery systems, multiple rocket launch systems, aircraft, helicopters, warships, and vehicles.</p>\n<p>The only way for Kellogg to create decisive negotiating leverage and stop the killing in Ukraine is to defeat Russia and drive it out of the country. That involves the use of all the instruments on national power: diplomatic, information, military and economy, <a data-id=\"4874708\" data-type=\"post\" href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/4874708-biden-diplomatic-power-ukraine/\">or DIME</a>. </p>\n\n<p>New sanctions, coordinating with OPEC to drive down the cost of oil, and targeting shadow fleets alone will not bring Putin to the negotiation table. The hammer — the punch to the face — must come from the military instrument of national power. While Ukraine is effectively targeting oil refineries, they must take pressure off their front-line units in the close fight, and that requires interdiction.</p>\n<p>This entails targeting Russian, North Korean and Chechen forces, their equipment, weapons, ammunition, fuel, supplies in Russia before they enter Ukraine. It means targeting them in their assembly areas, at the seaports, airports, and railheads, ammunition storage areas and fuel depots. Only when Putin feels threatened with the loss of his army will he come to the negotiation table — sanctions will not do that.</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>Putin will negotiate with Kellogg, but only when he is made to realize he has truly lost on the battlefields of Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Anything less, and it is likely Yalta 2.0 whenever Putin and Trump meet.

Trump said the Palestinians who have lived in Gaza have “lived a miserable existence.” He suggested other countries <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/04/trump-netanyahu-meeting/\">invest millions of dollars</a> to create “numerous sites or one large site” where Palestinians could relocate.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Netanyahu — who during the press conference called Trump “the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House” — said that he was open to the idea.</p>\n<p><em>“You say things others refuse to say and after the jaws drop, people scratch their heads and they say, ‘You know, he’s right,’” </em>Netanyahu said. <em>“President Trump is taking it to a much higher level. … He sees a different future for that piece of land. It’s worth paying attention to this. We’re talking about it. It’s something that could change history.”</em></p>\n\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/trump-gaza-netanyahu-takeover.html\">The New York Times</a>: With his Gaza plan, an unbound Trump pushes an improbable idea.</p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/gaza-israel-palestinians-ceasefire-aid-war-e1657d315ccc5ba66d15f48100f7981b\">The Associated Press</a>: Aid is surging into Gaza under the ceasefire.

The plan was developed by Trump’s son-in-law <strong>Jared Kushner</strong>, whose background is in real estate development. </p>\n<p>Asked about the possibility of sending U.S. troops to Gaza, Trump said the U.S. will “do what is necessary” as he laid out plans for the U.S. to take the area over in “a long-term ownership position,” and he suggested he would visit the territory. </p>\n<p>Gaza is not a sovereign land and is considered under international law to be occupied territory.</p>\n\n<p><em>“A U.S. invasion of Gaza would lead to the slaughter of thousands of U.S. troops and decades of war in the Middle East,”</em> Sen. <strong>Chris Murphy</strong> (D-Conn.) <a href=\"https://x.com/chrismurphyct/status/1886934775618834692?s=46\">wrote on the social platform X</a>.<em> “It’s like a bad, sick joke.”</em></p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/deranged-problematic-bipartisan-lawmakers-bash-trumps-gaza-proposal-rcna190733\">NBC News</a>: “Deranged” and “problematic”: Bipartisan lawmakers bash Trump’s Gaza proposal.</p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/world-reacts-to-trumps-gaza-proposal/\">Politico</a>: Trump’s Gaza plan sparks backlash in the Middle East.</p>\n\n<p>The proposal underscores Trump’s broad approach to the region and appears to give little consideration to what Palestinians have said they want. Gazans generally want to stay on their land, and neighboring Arab nations have fiercely opposed handing over territory because they do not want to aid an Israeli expulsion of Palestinians. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan have resisted Trump’s attempts to convince them to take in Palestinians during the reconstruction of Gaza, a process he has said could take 10 or 15 years. The Geneva Convention <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/04/us/trump-administration-rfk-jr-gabbard/af41dbc8-a411-5b0c-854a-4a20a1efe6f0?smid=url-share\">bars mass forcible transfers of populations</a>.</p>\n<p><em>“Our Palestinian people, and the people of Gaza in particular, are rooted here and will not go anywhere,”</em> <strong>Mustafa Ibrahim</strong>, a Gaza-based political expert, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/04/trump-netanyahu-meeting/\">wrote on Facebook</a>. <em>“If Trump wants to pave something, he can go pave the sea.”</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5127164-trump-netanyahu-joint-presser/\">The Hill’s Laura Kelly has five key takeaways</a> from the joint news conference.</p>\n\n<p>Netanyahu also gave credit to Trump for the ceasefire deal in Gaza ahead of former <strong>President Biden</strong>, whose team — along with mediators from Qatar and Egypt — spearheaded the negotiations over many months. Trump’s Middle East adviser, <strong>Steve Witkoff</strong>, joined the talks in their final phase.</p>\n<p>Mediators <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-says-talks-second-phase-gaza-ceasefire-deal-have-started-2025-02-04/\">are beginning talks on phase two</a> of the three-phase ceasefire deal that is expected to go into effect on March 1 — although that deadline can be extended as long as both Israel and Hamas are engaged in talks. But Trump said he doubted whether the Palestinian Authority, the ruling body in the West Bank, could administer Gaza.</p>\n<p><em>“Well it’s had a pretty hard time wouldn’t you say?”</em> he said. <em>“I’d say it’s had a pretty bad time of it.”</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<p><strong>SMART TAKE with NewsNation’s BLAKE BURMAN</strong>:</p>\n<p>Here’s some video you don’t see every day, perhaps ever. NewsNation’s <strong>Ali Bradley</strong> reports the Mexican cartels are now turning to weaponized drones, and even using them on each other.   </p>\n<p>Ali told me the other day that cartels authorized the use of weaponized drones at the southern border. Her report caught the attention of Rep. <strong>Glenn Ivey</strong> (D-Md.). <em>“That’s not surprising to hear that after what you saw happened with Ukraine, and especially with the Hamas attacks in Israel,”</em> he told me. </p>\n\n<p>You’ve likely heard a good amount about the cartels recently. Prepare to hear a lot more. The cartels are a focus of <strong>President Trump</strong> and his team, and the administration recently labeled them as foreign terrorist organizations.   </p>\n<p><em>“To the cartels: All options are on the table.

We’re right on schedule,”</em> he said.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/?p=5126025\">caught between the debt and their tax base</a>, Republicans are considering novel ways to account for the cost of their legislative agenda as a budget cut impasse looks set to hamstring early moves on their tax bill. Known as working from the “current policy baseline,” the accounting method would let Republicans sweep nearly $5 trillion of debt under the rug — likely producing a much smaller and more palatable number by which the tax legislation would add to the deficit. </p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5126182-donald-trump-executive-order-transgender-sports-ban/\">The Hill</a>: Trump is expected to sign an executive order today banning transgender athletes from competing in girls’ and women’s sports, the latest in a string of executive actions from the new administration taking aim at LGBTQ rights.</p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5127118-transgender-women-prison-housing-ruling/\">The Hill</a>: A federal judge in Washington, D.C., will hear a request today from three anonymous transgender inmates to block Trump’s executive order mandating that incarcerated transgender women be housed in male facilities.</p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5126065-department-of-education-trump-musk-doge-doe-usaid/\">The Hill</a>: Trump is reportedly eyeing an executive order to dismantle the Education Department, which has placed dozens of staffers on leave in what their union says is a move to encourage resignations.</p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/race-politics/5125957-trump-attacks-dei/\">The Hill</a>: Diversity, equity and inclusion proponents are scrambling to find ways to counter Trump as he moves to dismantle some of the programs and policies intended to bolster their movement. </p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5126581-trump-withdraws-from-un/\">The Hill</a>: Trump withdrew the U.S. from the United Nations Human Rights Council and UNESCO, the United Nations Educations, Scientific and Cultural Organization, on Tuesday with the stroke of his pen.</p>\n<p><strong>The big question plaguing Democrats </strong>since their grueling loss in November: Who is the party leader? <a href=\"https://thehill.com/?p=5126667\">It’s a question party operatives have encountered trouble in answering</a>.

The outlets also receive a smaller portion of their financing from the federal government and member stations.</p>\n\n<p>NPR said in a statement to The Hill it is “confident any review of our programming and underwriting practices will confirm NPR’s adherence to these rules.”</p>\n<p>GOP lawmakers are putting a spotlight on NPR and PBS, too.</p>\n<p>On Monday, a House subcommittee on government efficiency headed by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) called on the outlets’ executives to testify at a hearing concerning “the systemically biased news coverage produced on behalf of federally funded radio and TV stations.”</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>“Since its inception, NPR has collaborated with local nonprofit public media organizations to fill critical needs for news and information in America’s communities,” NPR said in a statement to The Hill. “We welcome the opportunity to discuss the critical role of public media in delivering impartial, fact-based news and reporting to the American public.”</p>\n<p>The latest targeting of public broadcasters comes as the White House has embraced more social and independent media platforms in lieu of mainstream news outlets, several of which the president decried or sued along the campaign trial.</p>\n<p>Some observers pointed to a line in Carr’s letter that questioned “why Congress should continue sending taxpayer dollars to NPR and PBS given the changes in the media marketplace since the passage of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.”</p>\n\n<p>Ellen Goodman, a professor of media policy and law at Rutgers, noted that comment was a telling one.</p>\n<p>“The public broadcasters have struggled for a long time with diversifying their audiences not just in terms of age but across all demographics,” Goodman said. “Still, it’s clear from Carr’s rhetoric there certainly is an interest in going after media whose content is objectionable, and that presents a big First Amendment problem.”</p>\n<p>Several journalists at NPR and member stations declined to comment on the record when contacted by The Hill. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p>NPR has long been on the receiving end of attacks from conservatives and allies of the current administration. It famously left the social platform X after owner Elon Musk attached an official “state media” label to its account.</p>\n<p>Musk, who now leads Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, on Monday reiterated calls to “defund NPR,” saying the outlet “should survive on its own.”</p>\n<p>FCC Commissioner Anna M. Gomez, who was nominated to her position by former President Biden in 2023, criticized Carr’s posture.</p>\n\n<p> “This appears to be yet another Administration effort to weaponize the power of the FCC,” she <a href=\"https://x.com/AGomezFCC/status/1885047186028728499\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wrote in a post</a> on social media responding to Carr’s letter. “The FCC has no business intimidating and silencing broadcast media.”</p>\n<p>It is unclear how far the Trump administration will go in its efforts toward NPR and other public media outlets, though some are anticipating it could reach a fever pitch.</p>\n<p>“NPR opens itself up to criticism from people who don’t want them around because they’re getting some government funding,” said Juan Williams, who worked at the public broadcaster for a decade before becoming a senior political analyst at Fox News.</p>\n\n<p>“My concern is now the Trump people are saying they don’t even think they should have [private] underwriters because they see that as a way to absolutely kill them off.”</p>\n</div>",
