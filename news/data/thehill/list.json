But beneath the headlines was a spot-on strategic instinct. Greenland is a rapidly rising geopolitical heavyweight the U.S. cannot afford to ignore.  </p>\n<p>As Russia expands its Arctic military footprint and China pours billions into securing long-term access to the Arctic region, Greenland is steadily moving toward independence. The real question isn’t whether the U.S. should engage, but how — and whether we will act before Beijing or Moscow fills the void. </p>\n\n<p>To secure U.S. leadership in the Arctic, Congress must move beyond symbolic gestures and adopt a bold, bipartisan strategy that deepens U.S.-Greenland ties, strengthens Arctic security, and lays the groundwork for Greenland’s eventual NATO membership.  </p>\n<p>Russia and China aren’t waiting around in the Arctic, and neither should the U.S. Moscow is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/graphics/ARCTIC-SECURITY/zgvobmblrpd/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ramping up its military presence</a> with new bases, nuclear-capable missiles and its most capable naval fleet. At the same time, Beijing is <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jan/05/2002560338/-1/-1/0/ARCTIC%20BLUEPRINT%202021%20FINAL.PDF/ARCTIC%20BLUEPRINT%202021%20FINAL.PDF\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">building more nuclear-powered icebreakers</a>, pouring billions into <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/08/02/nx-s1-5052089/pentagon-sounds-alarm-over-russia-china-cooperation-in-the-arctic\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dual-use Arctic research and infrastructure</a> and sailing its Navy further north.  </p>\n<p>Right in the middle of it all is Greenland — a resource-rich island with enormous strategic value to the U.S. and NATO.  </p>\n<p>To bolster defense, lawmakers should direct the Department of Defense to assess the feasibility of forward-basing elements of a <a href=\"https://seapowermagazine.org/admiral-cool-to-notion-of-separate-arctic-fleet/?print=print\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Arctic Fleet</a> in Greenland, incorporating this review into the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act. Washington should also work with Copenhagen and Nuuk to invest in joint military infrastructure, including port expansions and improved airstrips, to support NATO operations in the High North.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>To improve intelligence-sharing, Congress should fund the establishment of a NATO Arctic Intelligence Fusion Center in Nuuk, modeled after <a href=\"https://web.ifc.bices.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">similar initiatives</a> in Eastern Europe. This would provide real-time surveillance of Russian and Chinese activity, giving the U.S. and its allies better situational awareness in an increasingly navigable and contested Arctic region. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Greenland’s independence efforts will require a roadmap for transitioning from Danish military protection to self-defense. Congress should direct the Defense Department to develop a plan that helps Greenland build its own defense capabilities — ensuring it can secure its borders and contribute to regional stability. </p>\n\n<p>Greenland isn’t just an Arctic stronghold — it’s sitting on a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/greenland-trump-climate-change-minerals-trade-bab5bb60ba52f6073f056fb271c43215\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">goldmine of rare earth elements</a>, crucial for U.S. defense systems, semiconductors, and renewable energy technology. With China controlling more than 70 percent of global rare earth production, the U.S. needs an alternative supply chain before it’s too late. </p>\n<p>Congress should introduce the U.S.-Greenland Rare Earth Security Act<em>,</em> which would offer tax incentives and loan guarantees for U.S. companies investing in Greenland’s mining sector. Expanding the <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R43767\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Defense Production Act </a>to prioritize Greenland as a strategic supplier of critical minerals would further reduce America’s reliance on Beijing. </p>\n<p>A U.S.-Greenland Strategic Minerals Partnership could streamline regulatory cooperation, fast-track mining projects and promote environmentally responsible extraction — ensuring Greenland benefits economically while reinforcing U.S. supply chain security. This is a win-win: Greenland gains independence from Danish subsidies, and the U.S. secures a reliable source of rare earth elements. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Greenland is moving <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/greenland-prime-minister-mute-egede-independence-denmark-colonialism-donald-trump-arctic/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">toward independence</a>, but it doesn’t want to be absorbed by another country. Instead, it wants strategic partnerships that allow it to stand <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/greenland-poll-mute-egede-donald-trump-takeover-united-states/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on its own</a>. That’s where a compact of free association comes in.</p>\n<p>Modeled after U.S. agreements with Pacific nations like Palau and the Marshall Islands, <a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/feature/its-time-us-greenland-free-association-agreement-213327/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a compact of free association with Greenland </a>would formalize military, economic and diplomatic ties without compromising Greenland’s sovereignty. Congress should request a State, Interior, and Defense Department feasibility study to assess the benefits of such a compact, laying the groundwork for introducing the U.S.-Greenland COFA Authorization Act<em> </em>to begin formal negotiations. </p>\n<p>To ensure Greenland’s transition to independence is successful, Congress should also create a Greenland Independence Transition Fund, which would provide targeted investments in governance, infrastructure and workforce development — helping Greenland reduce reliance on Danish subsidies while preparing for NATO integration. </p>\n\n<p>The U.S. can’t just treat Greenland as a security asset — it needs to invest in Greenland’s economic future. Congress should support expanding the U.S. consulate in Nuuk, increasing diplomatic staff focused on trade, education, and Arctic governance. Launching a U.S.-Greenland Business Council and U.S.-Greenland Arctic Innovation Fund would encourage American companies to invest in Greenland’s renewable energy, fisheries, and infrastructure projects.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-26051-3_10\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Investing in education</a> and workforce development will also be critical. Congress should establish a U.S.-Greenland Education Exchange Initiative <em>— </em>modeled after the <a href=\"https://us.fulbrightonline.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fulbright Program</a><em> — </em>STEM<em> </em>scholarships, teacher training partnerships and vocational programs in critical industries like mining and energy.  </p>\n<p>Congress has an opportunity to lead now. Holding House Foreign Affairs Committee hearings on Greenland’s strategic role, introducing the U.S.-Greenland COFA Authorization Act, and organizing a congressional delegation to Greenland should be immediate priorities in 2025. </p>\n\n<p>This bold, bipartisan strategy ensures that as Greenland moves toward independence, it does so as a committed U.S. ally — aligned with Western values and fully integrated into NATO. The window of opportunity is closing, and America must lead now. </p>\n<p><em>Walter Berbrick is a senior military analyst with Netsimco, a Saalex Company.

But none of the music artists name-checked Trump while railing against some of his administration’s core focuses.</p>\n<p>Even Grammys host Trevor Noah <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/5122250-trevor-noah-talks-tariffs-at-grammys-maple-syrup-is-about-to-be-50/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">offered up</a> a Trump-related punchline, minus actually speaking the president’s name.</p>\n<p>“Yesterday, Beyoncé announced her new tour,” Noah said on the CBS broadcast. “I will say though, Beyoncé, there’s tariffs. We can’t afford a new tour. Maple syrup is about to be $50,” Noah said, referring to tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China that had been threatened by Trump.</p>\n<p>“Everybody’s sort of radio silent in terms of mentioning Trump’s name,” noted Mark Harvey, an associate professor and the director of graduate business programs at the University of Saint Mary.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>The approach from many in the entertainment world just weeks into Trump’s second term is in stark contrast to Hollywood’s reaction to the commander in chief following his White House win in 2016. A day after Trump’s 2017 inauguration, a who’s who of Hollywood — including Madonna, Scarlett Johansson and America Ferrera — <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/315466-womens-march-takes-over-dc/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">joined protesters</a> and denounced the new president at the Women’s March on Washington and in other U.S. cities.</p>\n<p>“There’s a night and day difference” between then and now, said Harvey.</p>\n\n<p>The first Trump era was marked by celebs making headlines as they assailed Trump on a regular basis. In 2016, singer <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/292448-cher-blasts-trump-i-just-wish-hed-fall-off-the-face-of-the/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cher dubbed</a> Trump a “f‑‑‑ing idiot,” saying she wished the then-GOP presidential nominee would “fall off the face of the Earth.” Comedian Kathy Griffin <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/335660-kathy-griffin-beheads-trump-in-gory-photo/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">posed for</a> a controversial photo in 2017 with a bloodied, decapitated fake head meant to resemble the president. Robert De Niro received a standing ovation from the audience at the Tony Awards in 2018 after repeatedly declaring “f‑‑‑ Trump” onstage. </p>\n<p>But in interviews since his November reelection, performers have kept Trump’s name out of the conversation.</p>\n<p>“The main thing is I have so much compassion and love for so many people that are afraid today,” Lady Gaga said in <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/5110928-lady-gaga-mayhem-trump-lgbtq/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an interview</a> with Elle UK conducted just days after Trump’s win, which the “Born This Way” singer said she “prayed” wouldn’t happen.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-less-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Eva Longoria similarly <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/4990187-eva-longoria-trump-america-dystopian-us/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">didn’t utter</a> Trump’s name while expressing dissatisfaction with him winning the 2024 race against then-Vice President Harris in a November interview with Marie Claire, saying, “The shocking part is not that he won.”</p>\n<p>“It’s that a convicted criminal who spews so much hate could hold the highest office,” said the former “Desperate Housewives” star, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/4788601-hollywood-kamala-harris-biden-trump-clooney-longoria-streisand/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">who campaigned</a> for Harris and spoke at the Democratic National Convention.</p>\n<p>These days, said Harvey, Hollywood seems to be reflecting an attitude of “we’ve been here before, we’ve seen this before.”</p>\n\n<p>“What we did last time wasn’t having an impact, so maybe we should do things differently now,” Harvey, the author of “Celebrity Influence: Politics, Persuasion and Issue-Based Advocacy,” said of what Trump’s bevy of star-studded critics could be thinking.</p>\n<p>Many famous faces, Harvey said, likely find themselves in a similar predicament right now as the Democratic Party itself. </p>\n<p>“If you compare 2016 to now — the slightest thing, every executive order, everything — had an outraged response. You could argue this was a justifiable outrage, but it also didn’t matter,” Harvey said.</p>\n\n<p>“[Celebrities] spoke out, and they felt probably by now that some of that was ineffective. I think they’re being more choosy about their outrage or how they’re going about this. This is going to have to be less about Donald Trump, and more about the issues.”</p>\n<p>It’s a reset that, knowingly or not, echoes a change in messaging that <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/343559-new-dem-message-doesnt-mention-trump/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Democrats adopted</a> as part of their 2018 agenda ahead of the midterm elections. In messaging documents released in 2017, Trump’s name was not mentioned a single time. </p>\n<p>“People need to know not only what we’re fighting against,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said at the time. “They need to know what we’re fighting for.”</p>\n\n<p>Some big names have been open about utilizing a Lord Voldemort-like approach to Trump’s name. In J.K. Rowling’s famed “Harry Potter” series, the villain is rarely referred to by his name by the other characters out of fear and worry of retribution. </p>\n<p>“I think it might be irresponsible to give him attention,” Stephen Colbert <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/547700-colbert-theres-no-avoiding-trump-but-i-dont-like-saying-his/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said of Trump</a> in 2021. </p>\n<p>While “there’s no avoiding him as a subject,” the “Late Show” host said of the then-ex-president, “He shouldn’t be [an] essential subject because I think that merely empowers him in some way. That’s why I don’t like saying his name, or showing his picture, if possible.”</p>\n\n<p>Colbert made an appeal to his show’s viewers to submit alternative name suggestions for Trump on social media using the hashtag #HeWhoShallBeNamed. The late-night host <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/4254422-colbert-writers-strike-saying-trumps-name-again/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">began saying</a> “Trump” again on his CBS program in 2023. </p>\n<p>“The View” co-host Whoopi Goldberg <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/372243-whoopi-goldberg-i-cant-even-say-trumps-name/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">also adopted</a> a personal “don’t speak his name” Trump policy on the ABC daytime talk show. </p>\n<p>“He’s the president. I’m still not going to say his name. That’s not going to change,” <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/the-view-whoopi-goldberg-refuses-trump-name-election-win-1236202564/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Goldberg told</a> viewers a day after the 2024 presidential election.</p>\n\n<p>Harvey noted that there are only certain circumstances in which celebrities can exert political influence. While they may fill up movie theaters and concert halls, superstars “are not good at convincing people on issues that are highly polemic.”</p>\n<p>“Celebrities can’t get people to give up their guns. Celebrities can’t get people to change their mind on abortion,” Harvey said. “Do you think they’re going to change anybody’s mind on Donald Trump? Probably not.”</p>\n</div>",

By the time of the American Revolution, the authority of the British Parliament <a href=\"https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/006efae3-6a5e-4082-8fc0-4f77911dc042/content\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">had been established</a>, but the colonists resented King George III’s bullying behavior. So the framers established three co-equal branches of government — legislative, executive and judicial — each of which was designed to answer to the other two.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch10s16.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Federalist No. 51</a>, James Madison explained that it was necessary to “partition … power among the several departments” so that “its several constituent parts may, by their mutual relations, be the means of keeping each other in their proper places.” He called it “a reflection on human nature, that such devices should be necessary to control the abuses of government.” Three distinct branches offered “the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department” on the theory that “if men were angels,” Madison wrote, “no government would be necessary.”</p>\n<p>The Constitution’s design was thus as much about psychology as it was about politics. The Framers understood that part of human nature is to amass, entrench and ultimately abuse power, so there must be disincentives to protect against bad behavior.</p>\n<p>Every road has a speed limit, but drivers honor only some of them. If there’s no chance of a speeding ticket, most people ignore the rules. But once a speed-trap machine is installed in the bushes, drivers begin to slow down. It’s not the speed limit sign that does it — it’s the threat of a consequence for speeding.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>The same goes for the laws that bind presidents, which include legislation enacted by Congress, rulings by federal judges and the Constitution itself. What these laws say is far less important than whether the other branches “issue tickets” to a president who blows through them.</p>\n<p>Trump, just two weeks into his second term, has already made very clear that he expects no tickets for speeding in the Oval Office — not from the Constitution, not from Congress and possibly not even from the courts. Consider just four examples.</p>\n\n<p>For starters, Musk is an extra-constitutional actor with no constitutional or statutory authority to do what he is doing. He is <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/02/politics/usaid-officials-leave-musk-doge/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly taking steps</a> to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development altogether, as well as <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/musk-aides-lock-government-workers-out-computer-systems-us-agency-sources-say-2025-01-31/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">locking career civil servants</a> out of computer systems and enabling his own team’s access to the personal data of the federal workforce. The three-branch system does not include a “fourth” branch for private billionaires; slapping a made-up label on Musk’s so-called “department” does not legalize Musk’s status.</p>\n<p>Second, Trump has also already flouted legislation enacted by Congress and signed into law by prior presidents. In firing <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/01/25/trump-inspectors-general-agencies/77945298007/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">17 inspectors general</a>, for example, he ignored a binding requirement under federal law that he give 30 days’ notice to Congress with a justification in advance.</p>\n<p>Trump also issued a memo <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/state-department-trump-foreign-aid-bf047e17ef64cb42a1a1b7fdf05caffa\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">freezing federal funding</a> on all “financial assistance programs” authorized by Congress. This is known as <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/01/28/can-trump-cancel-government-funds-through-impoundment-what-to-know-as-he-pauses-all-federal-assistance/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">impoundment</a>. When President Richard Nixon tried this, Congress passed the Impoundment Control Act, requiring presidents to get permission from Congress; if Congress doesn’t acquiesce, the funds get released after 45 days.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>The Trump administration appears again to be taking the position that the Impoundment Act is unconstitutional. But that’s a question that’s for the courts, not the president, under the landmark 1803 ruling in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1789-1850/5us137\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Marbury v. Madison</a>. Trump also stopped federal spending under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Biden-era funding initiatives for infrastructure and climate.</p>\n<p>Third, Trump already seems to be treading precariously on the authority of the federal courts. On Jan. 27, U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Mehta-lifts-dc-capitol-bar-oath-keepers.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reversed his prior order</a> barring nine of the Jan. 6 defendants from entering the U.S. Capitol after Trump had commuted their sentences. Mehta noted that everyone — the defendants, their lawyers and the U.S. Probation Offices — had agreed that even though the commutations released them from prison, the defendants were still subject to their terms of supervised release and the jurisdiction of the court. Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the Oath Keepers, even publicly stated that he would “report to [his] probation officer.”</p>\n<p>Trump’s Justice Department subsequently filed a motion stating that the defendants “are no longer subject to the terms of supervised release and probation.” In his order reversing himself, Judge Mehta noted that “the motion concludes not with a request for relief, but with an ‘indicat[ion] that the Order must be vacated.’” Translation: Trump declared what the law is and issued an order to a federal judge, not the other way around.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, Trump is flagrantly ignoring the text of the Constitution and settled Supreme Court law. His rationale for the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">executive order</a> excluding certain categories of Americans from birthright citizenship was that “the Fourteenth Amendment has never been interpreted to extend citizenship universally to everyone born within the United States.” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-xl/politics/government/birthright-citizenship-is-unconstitutional-says-white-house-press-secretary/ar-AA1y25e2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">told reporters</a> that “birthright citizenship is unconstitutional.”</p>\n<p>But in <a href=\"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/trump-power-grab-executive-orders-birthright-citizenship-tiktok-constitution\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. v. Wong King Ark</a>, the Supreme Court in 1898 rejected the argument Trump is making for limiting the Constitution’s birthright citizenship guarantee. If the Supreme Court doesn’t act to shore up its own authority, Trump could be setting a dangerous new precedent that he — not the high court — gets to decide what the Constitution means.</p>\n<p>The framers offered up way to stop this disturbing power grab in its tracks. It’s called impeachment. Yet while the Trump administration takes a wrecking ball to the Constitution, the people’s elected representatives in Congress are mostly standing meekly by, eschewing their constitutional authority to hold the executive branch accountable to the people. One day, the people may have had enough of all of them.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kimwehle\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Kimberly Wehle</em></a><em> is author of the new book </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/How-Pardon-Power-Works_and-Why/dp/1954907508/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_w=POyv6&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.f76d456a-cb0d-44de-b7b0-670c26ce80ba&amp;pf_rd_p=f76d456a-cb0d-44de-b7b0-670c26ce80ba&amp;pf_rd_r=136-3333194-6622308&amp;pd_rd_wg=Z6ulj&amp;pd_rd_r=82df5ba2-dee9-4a62-bb9b-d463199696a9&amp;ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>“Pardon Power: How the Pardon System Works — and Why.”</em></a></p>\n</div>",

Trump’s strategy of dismantling USAID amid a flurry of executive orders is almost certainly an <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/foreign-aid/5123972-lawmakers-legal-experts-warn-shuttering-usaid-is-unconstitutional/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">illegal exercise of powers </a>reserved for Congress.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t mean it won’t work. </p>\n\n<p>Trump’s first two weeks in office have been an unparalleled attack on the separation of executive and legislative power. Not only has Trump falsely claimed the power to <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-orders-temporary-funding-freeze-that-could-affect-trillions-of-dollars\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“freeze” spending</a> already appropriated by Congress — effectively a line item veto on steroids — his closure of USAID is a direct attack on congressional authority. Even so, good luck finding a <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/02/03/2025/usaids-breakup-sparks-little-outcry-from-even-pro-foreign-aid-republicans\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">single Capitol Hill Republican</a> willing to defend Congress’s equal status in this governing partnership. </p>\n<p>Trump’s latest threat, to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/03/trump-finalizing-plans-shutter-education-department-00202225\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">shutter the Department of Education,</a> is written in the language of a president convinced he stands above the constitutional order. Our congressional leaders must send a message to the White House by fiercely defending their legal authority to decide the future of USAID. As history has too often shown, powers seized by the White House are almost never given back to their original owners. </p>\n<p>Even in a political culture where truth evaporates at room temperature, the law is clear. Despite starting its life by executive order under President John F. Kennedy in 1961, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5124147-trump-musk-usaid-attacks/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Congress codified USAID</a> as an official independent agency in the 1998 Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act. Republicans may think USAID is one big liberal slush fund, but it’s clearly up to Congress — not the White House — to determine the scope of the agency.  </p>\n<p>The specific threat posed by Trump’s power grab is one our Founders knew well. The issue was clearly on their mind during the drafting of the Constitution in 1787, having just fought a bloody war to free themselves from an overbearing executive. In fact, concerns about a president seizing legislative powers — especially the power of the purse — <a href=\"https://csac.history.wisc.edu/document-collections/constitutional-debates/executive-branch/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dominated the media discourse of the day</a>. How little has changed.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>The scenes outside USAID headquarters this week may have lacked the drama of the Boston Massacre, but what was going on inside was equally revolutionary. It was there that Trump ally and megadonor Elon Musk directed officials to be locked out of their offices and refused entry to the building. “Spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper,” Musk would later <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5122676-usaid-shutdown-elon-musk-doge/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gloat on X.</a></p>\n<p>Nobody in Republican circles seemed concerned that Musk, who faces no form of congressional oversight, had been given unrestricted access to the Treasury Department’s <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/treasury-dept-elon-musks-team-access-federal-payment/story?id=118380399\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sensitive payment system</a> as a means to further choke off USAID funds. Nor did a single Republican lawmaker speak up when Musk voiced the extreme legal theory that Trump could <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/trump-elon-musk-deleting-government-agencies-usaid-1235254897/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dissolve any agency or department he wanted</a> without consulting Congress.  </p>\n\n<p>The framers of our Constitution wisely agreed that if the president had a problem with a law passed by Congress, he could persuade and cajole them to reform or repeal the law. It was, crucially, a transparent process meant to play out in full view of the public. Our founders both anticipated and explicitly took steps to prevent the type of unilateral action Trump just unleashed on USAID. Their only failing was expecting Congress to jealously guard its power instead of willingly surrendering it to the president. </p>\n<p>As is so common in Trumpian schemes, the end result is legal and organizational chaos. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday declared himself <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/politics/usaid-washington-workers/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">acting director of USAID</a> and announced a plan for the State Department to absorb whatever parts of USAID Musk doesn’t evaporate entirely. That must come with some bitterness for Rubio, who was once one of the Senate’s <a href=\"https://www.devex.com/news/us-sens-kaine-and-rubio-back-bill-to-diversify-usaid-funding-100491\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">leading USAID expansionists</a>.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the Senate’s weak-willed Republicans think the federal courts will bail them out by ordering injunctions on Trump’s orders. That would certainly spare lawmakers the unpleasantness of disagreeing with Trump in public. But the Supreme Court’s recent <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/supreme-court-grants-trump-broad-immunity-for-official-acts-placing-presidents-above-the-law\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rulings broadly expanding executive power</a> aren’t reassuring. The courts simply can’t be counted on to uphold the constitutional balance of power. Congress will need to do this heavy lifting itself. </p>\n<p>Trump’s indefensible power grab at USAID, and his similar plans for the Department of Education, should give all lawmakers cause to reflect on their oath of office and what it means to serve our Constitution and our country. More than ever before, the American people need and deserve a strong Congress to check and balance Trump’s increasingly authoritarian White House.</p>\n<p><em>Max Burns is a veteran Democratic strategist and founder of Third Degree Strategies.</em>  </p>\n</div>",
