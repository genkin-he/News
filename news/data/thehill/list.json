Excited to cheer on the hometown squad, we turned out for what proved to be not much of a match. The opposition team didn’t even show up.</p>\n<p>I kept thinking about that this week, watching the roll-out of Week Two of Trump Two. Again, it was like there was only one team on the field. Team Trump certainly showed up, flooding the zone with multiple executive orders every day. But where was the resistance? With one exception, the Democratic team was missing in action.</p>\n\n<p>That one exception was an order from the Trump White House to freeze all federal grants across the board. It was obviously issued without any idea of how many worthwhile programs, domestic and global (think Meals on Wheels or cancer treatments at Walter Reed Hospital) would be impacted or how much human suffering would result. The result was chaos. And it backfired big time.</p>\n<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), in a news conference and speeches on the floor, immediately <a href=\"https://thehill.com/business/budget/5110266-democrats-question-legality-of-trump-freeze-on-federal-grants/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rallied Senate Democrats</a> and outside groups in protest. Each of these programs, they pointed out, had been approved and funded by Congress. And, under the Constitution, Congress controls the purse strings. The president has no authority under the law to undo what Congress has done. Within hours, the White House had backed down and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5113527-omb-federal-funding-freeze-rescind/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rescinded the freeze memo</a>.</p>\n<p>That quick response showed how important it is for Democrats not just to mildly criticize Trump’s imperial executive orders but to challenge and condemn every one of them immediately — and how successful such outright opposition can be. Unfortunately, that’s been the exception rather than the rule.</p>\n<p>Almost all other Trump orders have gone basically unchallenged, including: <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5106541-donald-trump-inspectors-general-ousters/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">firing 17 inspectors general</a> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/adam-schiff-trump-broke-law-firing-inspectors-general-rcna189327\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in violation of federal law</a>; <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ending birthright citizenship</a> in violation of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution; <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5103696-trumps-jan-6-pardons-house-republicans/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pardoning 1,500 of the Jan. 6 rioters</a>, many convicted of assaulting police officers; <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/01/28/trump-federal-workers-quit-severance\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">asking 2.3 million federal employees to consider resigning by Sept. 30</a> in violation of Civil Service regulations; banning transgender Americans from serving in the military; and launching an unprovoked trade war against our three leading trading partners.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>What’s been the Democrats’ response to these and other Trump initiatives right out of the pages of Project 2025? Crickets. Why? Because Democrats are suffering from an identity crisis. They’re split. Divided between those who want to challenge every outrageous Trump action and those, led by Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), who want to pick their battles.</p>\n<p>“We’re not going to go after every single issue,” says Schumer. “We can’t swing at every pitch,” echoes Jeffries. But, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/politics/trump-democrats-response.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CRight%20now%2C%20you%20have%20to,off%20the%20mat%20later%20on.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">counters Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.)</a>, “Right now, you have to swing at every pitch. If you let some of these egregious acts of his early days on pass without real protest, it normalizes the behavior. It ends up less likely that you convince anyone to get off the mat later on.”</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n\n<p>Murphy’s right. Democrats should have learned a long time ago that sitting back, playing nice and waiting for a better time to strike is a losing strategy. Look at 2004 presidential candidate John Kerry and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Kerry waited 22 days before responding to the first “Swift Boat” smears, while Clinton didn’t immediately condemn then-FBI Director James Comey for reopening an investigation of her emails just days before the election.</p>\n<p>There’s no time to wait. Democrats must pounce now. If Trump is flooding the zone every day, Democrats must do the same thing. They’ve got the megaphone. Democrats must use it — every day, on every outrage and every issue. Don’t delay. Raise hell.</p>\n<p><em><u><a href=\"https://x.com/BillPressPod\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BillPress</a></u> is host of “<u><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-bill-press-pod/id1171506369\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Bill Press Pod</a></u>.” He is the author of “<u><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Left-Life-Crossfire-Bill-Press/dp/1250147158\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">From the Left: A Life in the Crossfire</a></u>.”</em> <em>Follow him on BlueSky <u><a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/billpress.bsky.social\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@BillPress.bsky.social</a></u>.</em></p>\n</div>",

Examples: a March 14 deadline in Congress to keep the government funded, pressure to collaborate with Democrats to lift the nation’s borrowing authority to avert default, expectations for new spending to help victims of natural disasters and the hurdles of nudging fractious House and Senate Republicans to coalesce around the specifics of lower taxes, less spending, higher revenues and less red ink this year.</p>\n<p>The president used his power to leverage some concessions from Canada and Mexico but allowed a 10 percent tariff on China, which he announced Saturday, to take effect today. The new levy, layered on top of tariffs from his first term, affects more than $400 billion of goods that Americans purchase from China each year.

USAID has for decades administered billions of dollars of humanitarian and development assistance around the world. </p>\n<p>The move comes after <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, under the auspices of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a White House working group tasked with “eliminating government waste” took aim at the agency. USAID offices were closed Monday and employees were told to work remotely. Dozens of senior officials have been furloughed and hundreds of contract employees laid off. Trump issued a 90-day freeze on nearly all foreign assistance, and while the State Department issued waivers for some lifesaving humanitarian aid, confusion over instructions disrupted aid agency operations.</p>\n<p>Sen. <strong>Andy Kim</strong> (D-N.J.), a former USAID employee, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5124128-usaid-worker-turned-lawmaker-this-is-no-way-to-govern/\">was among a chorus of Democrats</a> on Monday blasting the turmoil surrounding the agency.</p>\n<p><em>“You have mysterious people within this new administration sending out emails across the entirety of USAID telling them not to show up,”</em> Kim said Monday at the agency’s Washington headquarters. <em>“This is no way to govern, this is no way to treat public servants and this is no way for us to conduct our foreign policy as a country.”</em></p>\n<p>Senate Minority Leader <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong> (D-N.Y.) said late last week that any effort to dissolve USAID would be <em>“illegal and against our national interests.” </em>Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee are calling on Chair <strong>Brian Mast</strong> (R-Fla.) <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5124297-democrats-urges-usaid-hearing/\">to convene an urgent hearing</a> with senior Trump administration officials about USAID.

In a letter to House Democrats, Jeffries <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5123216-jeffries-government-shutdown-trump-orders/\">hammered the administration for issuing a since-rescinded order</a> to freeze previously allocated federal aid.

The legislative branch started to resemble the one we have today, in which partisan allegiances, not preserving the power of Congress, determined whether a president’s ambitions would be checked or not.      </p>\n\n<p>Aside from that mid-1970s spasm of congressional dignity, that has been the story for most of the modern era. When then-President Biden took liberties on student loans or eviction moratoriums, a Democratic-controlled Congress cheered him on. Now, Trump is taking even more audacious actions and the Republicans in power are mostly willing to let him have his way.</p>\n<p>Can Trump refuse to spend money as required by law? Can he shut down agencies duly created by Congress? Can he fire employees protected by civil service laws? Can he put the entire system of federal payments under the control of a campaign donor who has never sat for a confirmation hearing?

But a source told The Hill on Monday that the vote will not take place this week amid jockeying among Republicans over how deep the spending cuts should ultimately be.</p>\n\n<p>“There will not be a budget resolution markup this week,” the source said. “Leadership provided an ambitious timeline and the House is doing the best it can to meet that.”</p>\n<p>The decision to delay the markup comes after leadership presented lawmakers with a framework that proposed $500 billion in spending cuts, Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), a member of the House Budget Committee, told The Hill. The blueprint came after Johnson last week said he wanted that number to be a “floor” and not a “ceiling” to give committees flexibility when crafting the ultimate bill, which is subject to strict budget reconciliation rules.</p>\n<p>But Norman — who is also a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus — called that figure a “nonstarter,” and he said he is pushing for a bottom-line figure between $2 trillion and $5 trillion.</p>\n<p>“I’d like it higher because I just don’t have any confidence that if we set a floor of X billion, which doesn’t begin to solve our math problem,” Norman said. “I know $500 billion is a nonstarter, but whether we can get what amount as a level is, in my world it’s just got to be there.”</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>“It’s about the numbers now,” he later added. “And it’s about not having expectations so low that it doesn’t give incentive to really make a difference now that we’ve got a chance.”</p>\n<p>The early obstacle for the GOP’s sweeping legislation — which Republicans say will include an extension of tax cuts, border enforcement funding and energy priorities — is a concerning sign for Johnson as he looks to send the bill to Trump’s desk by Easter or Memorial Day, a timeline some Republicans admit will be difficult to achieve.</p>\n\n<p>One source blamed House GOP leadership for the hang-up, faulting top lawmakers for proposing a small figure when it came to spending cuts.</p>\n<p>“It is very clear that a single, big-bill budget resolution is not going to move this week,” the source said before news broke of the markup delay. “That is a direct consequence of the leadership putting forward literally deficit increases on the floor last week, and then bumping that number up to something south of $600 billion, which is demonstrably short of the cuts necessary to achieve at least deficit neutrality.”</p>\n<p>Republicans are looking to pass the Trump agenda measure through a process known as budget reconciliation, which will allow the GOP to circumvent Democratic opposition in the Senate.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Before crafting the actual bill, however, lawmakers must advance a budget resolution — which lays out the parameters of the legislation — through the Budget Committee, on which a host of hard-line conservatives sit and have the power to thwart any effort. Legislation needs majority support in the committee before heading to the House floor for a vote of the entire chamber.</p>\n<p>A number of Freedom Caucus members sit on the Budget Committee, including Norman and Reps. Ben Cline (R-Va.), Chip Roy (R-Texas), Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) and Josh Brecheen (R-Okla.).</p>\n<p>Cline told The Hill on Monday lawmakers are working to move the budget resolution “as soon as possible” but are acutely aware of the little room for error they have amid a razor-thin majority.</p>\n\n<p>The bloc of hard-liners on the Budget Committee has enough power in numbers to block the resolution from advancing. And if the resolution does eventually hit the House floor, Republicans will have little — maybe even zero — room for error. When Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) departs the House to serve as the Trump administration’s ambassador to the U.N., which is expected to happen soon, Republicans will not be able to afford any defections on party-line measures.</p>\n<p>“We want to ensure that we’re all united behind the product,” Cline told The Hill, “and with our margin as thin as we have, we gotta measure twice and cut once, as we say.”</p>\n<p>The debate about how much to slash federal spending to offset Trump’s priorities on border, tax and other ideas is partly why the Freedom Caucus has been calling to split the reconciliation bill into two parts. That strategy would allow Republicans to quickly deliver on some of Trump’s border priorities while they figure out the trickier tax portion later in the year. But those who favor the one-bill track see risks in isolating the tax portion of the agenda and leaving it until later. </p>\n\n<p>Johnson, for his part, acknowledged concerns about the cost of Trump’s legislative priorities on “Fox &amp; Friends” on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSHw7d_PLxM\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Monday morning</a>, saying that Republicans are searching for savings to offset the price tag on the cuts. </p>\n<p>“We don’t want to blow a hole in the deficit by extending the Trump-era tax cuts, for example,” Johnson said. “But we’re definitely going to get that extended. So we’ve got to find those savings.”</p>\n<p>Jonson talked about actions outside the bill that could count as “savings” — such as income from new tariffs implemented by Trump and savings that result from changes made at the direction of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the Elon Musk-headed commission within the White House. </p>\n\n<p>“The tariffs are going to bring in revenue. We’re going to have massive savings by making government more efficient and effective,” Johnson said. </p>\n<p>But those kinds of external actions would not be counted as part of a traditional assessment of the budget resolution’s fiscal impact in a Congressional Budget Office score of the bill — and attempts by GOP leaders to count those extraneous moves as “savings” against the costly items in the budget resolution risk infuriating fiscal hawks who are looking for substantial cuts as part of the Trump agenda.</p>\n<p>Still, Johnson said during a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npMnkgW8SZ4\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fireside chat</a> with The Hill at the GOP retreat last week that he would like the reconciliation package to be deficit-neutral, and that he would prefer it to be deficit reducing.</p>\n\n<p>“That is a commitment we have. Why?” Johnson said. “Because the number one threat to our nation right now is our debt. It’s not China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea, it’s the debt, and we take that very seriously.”</p>\n</div>",
