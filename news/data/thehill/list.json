It puts Gabbard only days away from being considered on the Senate floor after a roller-coaster process.</p>\n\n<p>The vote took place only hours after Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), a key GOP swing vote, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5125280-todd-young-tulsi-gabbard-vote/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced that he would support her</a>.</p>\n<p>During Thursday’s confirmation hearing, the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5117815-tulsi-gabbard-snowden-controversy/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Indiana Republican was visibly frustrated</a> after Gabbard refused to call Edward Snowden, the former contractor-turned-leaker who fled the U.S., a traitor on multiple occasions.</p>\n<p>But on Tuesday Young said he secured a number of commitments from Gabbard regarding deterring Snowden-like whistleblowers, not pardoning Snowden and working to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.</p>\n<p>“I appreciate Tulsi Gabbard’s engagement with me on a variety of issues to ensure that our intelligence professionals will be supported and policymakers will receive unbiased information under her leadership,” Young <a href=\"https://x.com/sentoddyoung/status/1886799486640386197?s=46\">posted on the social platform X</a> alongside a letter Gabbard sent him of commitments in order to win his vote.  </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>“I have done what the Framers envisioned for senators to do: use the consultative process to seek firm commitments, in this case commitments that will advance our national security, which is my top priority as a former Marine Corps intelligence officer,” he continued. “Having now secured these commitments, I will support Tulsi’s nomination and look forward to working with her to protect our national security.”</p>\n<p>Gabbard had secured another big win on Monday as Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said that she would <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5124047-tulsi-gabbard-susan-collins-intelligence-committee-dni/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">back her in the committee vote</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Collins and Young had been seen as pivotal votes in committee, and winning over the pair likely also greases the skids for the former congresswoman on the Senate floor, where she can only afford to lose three Republicans. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is considered a likely “no” vote, while Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) indicated following the hearing that he had more “questions” about her confirmation. </p>\n<p>From the moment Trump announced Gabbard as his nominee to be DNI, questions have cropped up about her past views and statements.</p>\n<p>Those include her 2017 meeting with then-Syrian President Bashir al-Assad, which occurred as he was accused of using chemical weapons on his own people, as well as her stance on Russia given multiple comments she made about the war with Ukraine that were considered sympathetic to Moscow and were echoed on Russian state TV. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Gabbard also faced numerous questions over her past defense of Snowden.</p>\n<p>A key moment during Gabbard’s hearing came when Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) asked whether she views Snowden as a “traitor,” advising her that members of the Intelligence panel would feel a lot better about her nomination if she would do so.</p>\n<p>Instead, Gabbard sidestepped two questions about whether Snowden betrayed the nation, telling lawmakers she is “focused on the future and how we can prevent something like this from happening again,” referring to Snowden’s theft of secret documents.</p>\n\n<p>Lankford said it should have been an “easy question” to say it’s “universally accepted when you steal a million pages of top-secret documents and you hand it to the Russians, that’s a traitorous act.”</p>\n<p>Privately, Gabbard had <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/national-security/5092295-gabbard-defends-snowden-position/\">sought to assuage senators</a> about her views on Snowden, saying she didn’t feel he had the proper channels to blow the whistle.</p>\n<p>The Gabbard move also comes about a week and a half after senators confirmed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who lost three votes on the floor but got the greenlight thanks to a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Vance.</p>\n</div>",

The stakes are high. The international order has been awaiting a new global paradigm that transcends traditional concepts of multi-, bi- or unipolar world orders, and its time has arrived.</p>\n<p>President Trump’s inaugural address provided a road map for the new world order, one in which moral clarity, common sense, a pursuit of the commonality of interests and a robust use of power wherever and whenever necessary are its guidelines. This is a paradigm that could be dubbed “Mutually Assured Construction” (MAC) — a deliberate contrast to the Cold War doctrine of “MAD — Mutually Assured Destruction.”</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/us/politics/trump-israel-united-arab-emirates-uae.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Abraham Accords</a>, architected and implemented by Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, were a crowning achievement of their previous administrations. Both leaders have returned to govern their countries and both exemplify the potential of this new paradigm going forward.</p>\n<p>Israel’s position as America’s strategic partner in this trend-setting agenda cannot be overstated. Our relationship generates tens of billions in mutual economic benefits annually. Israel’s military innovations save American lives and dollars, from <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-army-inks-193-million-deal-to-buy-israeli-tank-defense-system/#:~:text=In%202016%2C%20the%20US%20military,the%20TROPHY%20system%20by%202020.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Trophy tank defense system</a> to drone technology. Our intelligence sharing and cybersecurity cooperation protect both countries from evolving threats. Israel has also taken out terrorists with bounties on their heads for killing Americans, and while Israel’s wars are not wars of choice, by fighting the bad actors here, we free Americans from having too.</p>\n<p>Most important, Israel has shown that the principled use of power can engender dramatic change for the better, an idea central to Trump’s goal of a new, safer and more equitable world order. No one imagined that the mass-murdering Assad regime in Syria would ever collapse, but after Israel was forced to decisively use its military to debilitate Hamas and Hezbollah, proxies of Iran’s global terror network, Assad’s Iranian-backed regime washed away like a rope of sand, dramatically changing the regional calculous for the better.</p>\n<p>But much remains to be accomplished. To achieve the president’s goal of ending wars, in the Middle East as elsewhere, we must end the current conflict differently than its predecessors. History teaches us that half-measures and international monitoring mechanisms against terror organizations simply don’t work. The president recently spoke about America’s own experience with relinquishing strategic territory far from its borders. For Israel, a nation smaller than New Jersey, maintaining security buffers along its borders is not a luxury, but a necessity, for survival.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>When Israel left Gaza in 2005, we hoped for peace. Instead, we got a terrorist state on our border. When we left Lebanon in 2000, we hoped for tranquility. Instead, we got an Iranian proxy army armed with 150,000 rockets aimed at our civilians. The lesson is clear: Our enemies, led by the Mullahs of Iran, interpret anything short of decisive Israeli victory as an invitation to prepare for the next round of violence. The path to genuine peace — the kind that prevents future wars rather than merely postponing them — requires decisive outcomes.</p>\n<p>Israel cannot leave Hamas standing any more than the U.S. could have left Hideki Tojo and his kamikazes standing after their attack on Pearl Harbor, or, for that matter, Al Qaida after 9/11. The Netanyahu government spoke for all the people of Israel when it set three goals for the war following the Hamas massacre of 10/7: First, the complete destruction of Hamas. Second, the release of all our hostages. Third, ensuring that Gaza can never again threaten the safety of the people of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Netanyahu shares with Trump a vision of how principled strength can transform regional dynamics. The steadfast insistence that Iran’s nuclear infrastructure be dismantled, along with the forging of unprecedented alliances with moderate Arab and Muslim states, ensures that the axis of evil that threatens both our nations will be defeated.</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>The United States and Israel share not just interests but fundamental values — democracy, rule of law and the belief that power should serve justice rather than replace it.

McCabe, a specialist in foreign assistance and foreign policy.</p>\n\n<p>McCabe cited portions of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 which temporarily granted the president authority to “reorganize” the agency but argued the power to do so expired in 1999. </p>\n<p>“Congress has not granted the President further authority to abolish, move, or consolidate USAID since,” she wrote.</p>\n<p>She also noted that the agency has long been under the “direct authority and foreign policy guidance of the Secretary of State.” Trump recently appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to serve as <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5123282-marco-rubio-usaid-take-over/\">acting head</a> of the agency while staffers fretted over expected <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5122676-usaid-shutdown-elon-musk-doge/\">operational cuts</a> from the Department of Government Efficiency following a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5097273-trump-executive-order-foreign-development/\">freeze</a> on foreign assistance. </p>\n<p>McCabe’s analysis noted past administrations have altered the functions of USAID, including shifting certain functions from USAID to the State Department, but not before notifying and consulting with the appropriate congressional committees. </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>“As USAID’s internal organization is not set in statute, Administrations have sometimes changed USAID’s  internal structure, often reflecting a President’s foreign policy priorities and foreign assistance initiatives,” McCabe outlined. </p>\n<p>“In these cases, the Administration is to notify and consult with ‘appropriate congressional committees’ in advance of such changes pursuant to procedures included in annual Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) appropriations bills (for FY2024 SFOPS, see Section 7063 of P.L. 118-47).”</p>\n\n<p>Her report flagged that in the coming weeks, lawmakers may seek to gain more information about the Trump administration’s proposed changes and its impact on federal funding. </p>\n<p>“Some Members have raised concerns regarding President Trump’s executive order pausing foreign assistance and actions taken to halt programs and dismiss agency leaders,” McCabe wrote. </p>\n<p>“The Administration’s actions to subsume USAID into the State Department may deepen such concerns and raise new questions among Members about the Administration’s compliance with congressional reporting and consultation requirements and the Administration’s use of funds appropriated to USAID and its programs.”</p>\n<p>She stated House and Senate Appropriations Committees and House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations Committees, in particular, might choose to probe through congressional hearings, letters, and informal communications. </p>\n<p>“Such oversight activities may shape how both the appropriators and authorizers approach USAID, State, and relevant programs in annual appropriations bills and consideration of potential legislation providing authorizations or restrictions,” she concluded.</p>\n</div>",

There are piles of rubble, we have to realistically look at how to rebuild Gaza. We are talking 10-15 years to rebuild. We have to work through and that’s what we’ll work through with Prime Minister Netanyahu,” Waltz added. </p>\n\n<p>The ceasefire deal is made up of three phases. Israel and Hamas are currently adhering to the first phase of the deal. </p>\n<p>A senior administration official said that the White House message, during a meeting with Arab ambassadors in Washington, was to try and find creative solutions that “would be humane and will provide dignity for the Palestinian people.” </p>\n<p>“I was there speaking with them, and what we’ve asked for is to work together with our Arab partners and friends in the region and with Israel, to all come together for creative solutions to this challenge,” the official said.</p>\n\n<p>“This is not going to be something that the United States is going to solve alone and that we’re going to impose on Arab [nations] and Israel, but rather, we’re asking our friends and partners and allies to come together as we look for what solutions we can provide that would be humane and will provide dignity for the Palestinian people.”</p>\n</div>",

It was not immediately clear what Hawley’s bill will include to circumvent this. </p>\n<p>Hawley introduced a bill in 2023 that would limit tech companies’ legal immunity under Section 230, but this did not pass. </p>\n<p>Just over a year ago, Hawley made headlines for his grilling of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who appeared before the Judiciary Committee alongside the leaders of four other popular social media networks. Amid pressure from Hawley, Zuckerberg eventually apologized to the families present at the hearing. </p>\n<p>The hearing put a spotlight on alleged harms that come from these platforms and amped up pressure on both the companies and policymakers to do more to protect children and teens. </p>\n<p>Still, by the end of last year, much of the legislation of kids’ online safety did not make it past the finish line amid pushback, largely from House Republicans concerned about censorship. </p>\n</div>",

Outside of those executive branch departments and agencies, very few specialists grasp the full extent of what should be known in order to make those agencies leaner, more efficient and more responsive to the will of elected officials. </p>\n\n<p>There are analysts at the Government Accountability Office who audit said agencies in response to the directives of Congress. But insofar as Congress is limited in its possession of the necessary “intelligence,” it has a correspondingly inadequate ability to specify the investigations and evaluations that GAO should conduct.</p>\n<p>Congressional limitations are the central problem here. The ability of our elected representatives to make optimally informed decisions about programs and budgets is constrained by the limited capabilities and numbers of congressional staff. </p>\n<p>A typical House member’s office has two legislative assistants and a legislative director. Each legislative assistant has a portfolio that includes multiple subject areas, most of which are unrelated to one another — for example, someone might have health policy, Social Security, transportation, homeland security, education and veterans affairs. It is impossible for such an assistant to develop serious expertise in all these subjects and their corresponding government agencies. This is partly because most legislative assistants are very young — usually just a few years into their careers — and because they have no experience working in the executive branch. Members of Congress must then rely on their committee staff, who are more senior and the most knowledgeable of all. </p>\n<p>Given the inexperience and paucity of trusted staffers capable of overseeing executive branch bureaucracies, the ability of Congress to gather the intelligence it needs to shape the nation’s laws is grossly suboptimal. And the fact that Congress depends on lobbyists to supply so much of the intelligence it receives makes it difficult for all concerned to evaluate the degree to which that information is biased. </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>The usual pattern for congressional staff is to serve several years on the Hill and then “graduate” to private-sector jobs or service in the executive branch. Both destinations offer much better salaries. One almost never sees executive branch officials move to congressional offices, because few Hill staff positions pay a family-friendly salary. Yet it is exactly former executive branch officials who are needed on congressional staffs — officials who have served long enough to know the lay of the land as well as the personnel who are likely to be responsive or resistant to the president’s agenda.</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>This situation is aggravated by false economies trumpeted by some members of Congress who proudly declare that they are “saving taxpayer dollars” by having such lean staffs stuck with substandard salaries. They live in fear that, should they actually pay their staff wages commensurate with the skill and responsibilities these jobs so obviously require, demagogues would accuse them of building an “imperial Congress” that rewards the politically connected. If there is anything in government as penny-wise and pound foolish as this “saving of money,” it would be hard to find.</p>\n\n<p>If the president and DOGE are serious about reducing the power, intrusiveness, waste, fraud and bloat of the administrative state, they would do well to encourage our congressional leaders to improve Congress’s ability to be a check and balance against the federal bureaucracy and to recruit sympathetic members of executive branch agencies who should not have to take a pay cut to render an inestimable national service.</p>\n<p><em>Dr. John Lenczowski is founder, president emeritus and chancellor of the Institute of World Politics.
