A hold on arms sales to Israel signals a major flouting of convention, where U.S. military support for Israel is viewed as an investment in American national security.   </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/u-s-readies-new-1-billion-arms-sale-to-israel-6832aa26\">Wall Street Journal reported</a> that the $1 billion arms sale package for Israel includes 4,700 1,000-pound bombs, worth more than $700 million, as well as armored bulldozers built by Caterpillar, worth more than $300 million, citing U.S. officials. </p>\n<p>The hold comes as Democrats <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5119639-democrats-frustration-trump-agenda/\">have seethed</a> over Trump’s actions a little over two weeks into his presidency. They pushed back on an initial federal aid freeze; are <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5116538-senate-democrats-oppose-trump-agenda/\">condemning a halt</a> on U.S. foreign assistance; <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5123663-democrats-blocked-entry-usaid/\">raising alarm</a> over the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID); and opposing the president’s threats of tariffs on America’s neighbors Mexico and Canada, to name a few of the high profile conflicts. </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>But there’s few options for Democrats to push back on Trump’s agenda absent Republican allies given the GOP’s slim majorities in the House and Senate. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5123870-schatz-trump-state-department-hold-usaid/\">have announced</a> they will delay and stall Trump’s State Department nominees until the administration retreats on its efforts to break up USAID. </p>\n<p>Trump could try and override the Israeli arms sale hold. In 2019, Trump issued an emergency declaration to push through more than $8 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan without congressional approval. The Republican-controlled Senate at the time <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/saudi-arabia-arms-deal-trump-what-to-know/\">voted to block</a> the arms sale. </p>\n\n<p>Arms sales to Israel are historically bipartisan, even as Democrats have increasingly raised alarm over Israel’s war conduct in the Gaza Strip and Netanyahu’s policies toward Palestinians. </p>\n<p>Amid Israel’s war against Hamas in response to the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack, an estimated half of the nearly 47,000 Palestinian casualties are women, children and the elderly. Nearly all of the two million Gaza residents require humanitarian assistance and 90 percent are displaced among widespread destruction. </p>\n<p>Still, Democrats in positions of power did not stand in the way of President Biden sending weapons to Israel or green-lighting arms sales. In June, Biden <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4727080-top-democrats-gregory-meeks-ben-cardin-israel-hamas-war-massive-weapons-package/\">moved forward</a> on a $18 billion arms sale to Israel. </p>\n<p>Netanyahu will meet with Trump at the White House on Tuesday and is expected to visit Capitol Hill and meet with lawmakers on Wednesday. </p>\n<p>The U.S. provides about $38 billion to Israel as part of a 10-year memorandum of understanding (MOU). That amounts to $3.3 billion in foreign military financing — generally a credit for Israel to purchase weapons systems in the U.S. and $500 million for missile defense programs annually. The MOU runs through fiscal year 2028 and will need to be renewed in 2029. </p>\n</div>",

And so one of the things that I’ve been saying is that white people are okay with the racial diversity as long as it is in the context of subjugation and inferiority.”</p>\n<p>Advocates often point to <a href=\"https://dei360.org/diversity-as-a-revenue-engine-what-16-studies-reveal/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">numerous studies that have</a> shown that companies profit from DEI programs both culturally and economically.  They have also been working to remind employers that Trump’s orders cannot supersede federal law. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>As advocates work to spread this message, they’ve also stepped up their legal challenges to Trump. </p>\n<p>On Monday, groups representing university diversity officers and professors, restaurant workers and Baltimore city officials filed a lawsuit against Trump and multiple federal agencies in the US District Court for the District of Maryland.</p>\n<p>The suit claims Trump’s order is too vague and threatens First Amendment and due process rights. </p>\n\n<p>“These executive orders are political theater, but they’re also really dangerous because they attempt to undermine existing law,” said Alphonso David, president and CEO of the Global Black Economic Forum. </p>\n<p>Trump, he added, “is trying to redefine race and its troubled relationship with this country, and he’s trying to ignore that systemic discrimination exists.”</p>\n<p>The White House defended its approach to DEI in a statement.</p>\n\n<p>“Minorities in America have recognized the Democrat Party’s empty promises and failed policies,” said Harrison Fields, principal deputy press secretary at the White House. “That’s why President Trump earned historic support from Black, Latino, Asian, and Arab Americans by prioritizing secure borders, economic opportunity, and an America First foreign policy. Meanwhile, the Left’s divisive focus on DEI policies undermines decades of progress toward true equality. The Trump administration rejects this backward thinking and will pursue an agenda that lifts everyone up with the chance to achieve the American Dream.”</p>\n<p>Davids said legislators must focus on strengthening those laws rather than introducing new bills.</p>\n<p>“This is not about advancing new policies. This is about complying with existing ones,” he said, emphasizing that it is still illegal for employers to discriminate on the basis of race, sex, ethnicity or disability. </p>\n\n<p>But lawmakers have to make sure their work is reaching more than just the streets of D.C., said democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright.</p>\n<p>“I think it will be malpractice to centralize this fight geographically to Washington,” said Seawright. Instead, he said, legislators have to make sure they’re educating Americans around the nation of the work they are doing, especially as 2026 midterm campaigning gets underway.</p>\n<p>“Throughout our history, particularly as Black Americans, Washington has never been the only battlefield we’ve had to fight on,” Seawright said. “We have to hyper-localize these discussions and fights because they’re taking place not just in Washington but all over the country.”</p>\n\n<p>Seawright added that the work to protect DEI cannot rest only upon Black legislators, such as the Congressional Black Caucus, if Democrats want to ensure change. </p>\n<p>“The CBC has always been on the front line pushing the envelope for change, so that won’t change, but we have to be careful making this just a CBC fight, because CBC represents more than just Black Americans, they represent all Americans from all walks of life,” Seawright said. </p>\n<p>“This has to be a broader fight. I think the CBC, the CHC and the Asian American Pacific Islander caucus, and every other community caucus has just as much of a responsibility to lead the fight on this.” </p>\n\n<p>In some ways, Seawright added, Republicans have to stand up to the president as well. </p>\n<p>“This impacts all of us, because every American has benefited in some way, shape or form, from the fertilization of diversity, equity and inclusion to the American soil,” said Seawright. </p>\n<p>Abrams, of APR, added that corporations have to take a stance as well.</p>\n<p>Meta, McDonalds, Walmart, Lowe’s and Target are all among a plethora of corporations to announce they would no longer continue their DEI programs.</p>\n<p>“They want to back down publicly while continuing to do these things quietly, because they know it works,” Abrams said. “We need to demand that these corporations stop trying to have it both ways, stop trying to continue to benefit from DEI behind closed doors. If you’re going to benefit from, then you have a responsibility to stand up in this moment and not to be bullied.”</p>\n<p>It will fall on consumers rather than politicians, Abrams added, to hold these corporations accountable. </p>\n<p>“This is not a moment where we need to panic and feel overwhelmed, but we have to remember what has come before, where we are right now, how much power we actually do have,” Abrams said. </p>\n</div>",

While the blueprint correctly diagnoses the bank’s inefficiencies, its prescription would be catastrophic for U.S. interests. </p>\n<p>Having moved from World Bank leadership to private sector corporate affairs, I can attest that it needs urgent reform — but abandoning it would be a strategic blunder of the highest order.</p>\n\n<p>The World Bank, for all its faults, remains America’s most powerful tool for global development leadership. When I led health reforms in countries from Armenia to Romania, I saw firsthand how its technical expertise and convening power advanced both development goals and American interests. In almost every case, countries chose the World Bank over other partners because of its unique ability to mobilize resources and expertise at scale.</p>\n<p>However, Project 2025’s criticism isn’t entirely wrong. The bank’s operating model desperately needs modernization. Drawing from my private sector experience, three market-based reforms could transform the institution’s effectiveness while preserving American leadership.</p>\n<p>First, revolutionize the workforce strategy. While private sector companies embrace flexible contracting to match staffing with evolving needs, the World Bank remains wedded to lifetime tenure for most positions. This rigidity wastes resources and stifles innovation. The bank should adopt private sector-style staffing models that prioritize impact over job security, while maintaining core institutional knowledge.</p>\n<p>Second, implement systematic market segmentation. The World Bank’s current country-by-country approach to defining priorities is inefficient and often politically driven. Instead, it should develop a comprehensive market taxonomy — similar to how private companies segment markets — to determine where and how to invest resources. This would prevent the wasteful tendency to try everything everywhere and enable more strategic resource allocation.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Third, rationalize the development finance landscape. Multiple agencies offering similar services with different terms creates inefficiency and enables “double-dipping” by borrowers. The U.S. should lead efforts to coordinate development partners and establish clear divisions of labor, similar to how private sector companies form strategic alliances to maximize impact.</p>\n<p>Critics might argue these reforms are too difficult to implement in a multilateral institution. But the alternative — U.S. withdrawal — would create a dangerous vacuum. China, through initiatives like the <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10154/17\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-massive-belt-and-road-initiative\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Belt and Road Initiative</a>, stands ready to fill any void left by American retreat.
