The Canadian leader announced various measures, including the appointment of a fentanyl czar and the deployment of personnel to the border, to stop the flow of the deadly opioid to the U.S.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, Canada<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4z23kndlyo\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> announced “far-reaching” tariffs of 25 percent on American goods</a>, moments after the U.S. had imposed similar measures on Canada.  </p>\n\n<p>President Trump was imposing American tariffs on Canada as part of a broader package. </p>\n<p>“Today, I have implemented a 25 percent tariff on imports from … Canada (10 percent on Canadian Energy), and a 10 percent additional Tariff on China,”<a href=\"https://x.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1885821495080825305?s=61\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Trump announced on X</a> Saturday afternoon. “This was done through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl.”</p>\n<p>“We don’t want to be here, we didn’t ask for this,” <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4z23kndlyo\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at a press conference on Saturday, when he announced Canada’s retaliation. But only in the most technical sense was the Canadian leader correct. At some point, it was virtually inevitable that Washington would lose patience with foot-dragging in Ottawa.</p>\n<p>Trump or no Trump, the U.S. was bound to do something. </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>“Canadians were very worried about President Trump’s statement that he would impose tariffs on their country in response to its weak control of its southern border and lack of restrictions on the export of fentanyl to the U.S.,” Charles Burton, an Ottawa-based security expert, and former Canadian diplomat, told me on Sunday. “Canadian politicians should not have been surprised by President Trump’s tariffs this weekend.”  </p>\n<p>Canadians had good reason to be concerned. On Nov. 25, Donald Trump<a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113546215051155542\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> in a Truth Social posting had promised</a> on the first day of his presidency to “sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25 percent tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders.”</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, he pledged that the new measures would last a long time: “This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as drugs, in particular fentanyl, and all illegal aliens stop this invasion of our country!” </p>\n<p>The then-incoming president had a point. “As everyone is aware, thousands of people are pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before,” Trump correctly wrote.</p>\n<p>People were certainly aware of the migrant flows from Mexico, which on Monday bought a temporary reprieve from Trump’s threatened tariffs. But the traffic from Canada has largely escaped attention. Although far more people cross the southern border, “the world’s longest undefended border” — the one the U.S. shares with its neighbor to the north — has become the favored route of some dangerous elements. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>The statistics are stunning. U.S. Border Patrol in Fiscal Year 2024 <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/illegal-crossings-northern-us-border-terror-suspects-arrested/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">apprehended</a> 155 suspects on the terror watchlist arriving from Mexico and 358 watchlist suspects coming from Canada.  </p>\n<p>“It was a flood we had not seen before,”<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/illegal-crossings-northern-us-border-terror-suspects-arrested/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/illegal-crossings-northern-us-border-terror-suspects-arrested/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said Erik Lavallee</a>, the Border Patrol agent in charge of the Beecher Falls Station in Vermont, to the CBS Boston affiliate last March. “It was an exponential shift, something we were not expecting and it just hit us hard.” </p>\n<p>Other parties have been taking advantage of America’s open border with Canada. Last February, for instance, Border Patrol apprehended three Chinese nationals trying to sneak into Maine at night near Fort Fairfield. A fourth Chinese national, already in immigration proceedings, was arrested on the U.S. side, apparently there by prearrangement to pick up the trio.</p>\n\n<p>These migrants should be viewed with suspicion. If they wanted to live in a free society, they would have looked for a Border Patrol agent to surrender to, so they could put themselves in the asylum waiting line and get benefits from generous localities. But because these migrants were trying to avoid detection, they were obviously coming to the U.S. for no good. </p>\n<p>Trump was right to link tariffs to border security. “If we are going to control immigration then we have to take a more strategic view of global trade flows,” Alan Tonelson, a trade expert who blogs at<a href=\"https://alantonelson.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> RealityChek</a>, told me in the middle of last year.</p>\n<p>“Tariffing trade partners Canada and Mexico is justified to press them to prevent illegal immigrants and opioids from entering the United States through their territories, but ultimately these issues will be settled by other, targeted measures,” said Tonelson before Trump’s tariff imposition. “In any event, we need a comprehensive rewrite of the three-country USMCA free-trade deal.”</p>\n\n<p>Trade and investment now connect Canada, Mexico and the U.S. into an integrated market, which means new American tariffs will damage all three economies. Yet Washington has little choice but to secure the northern border.</p>\n<p>“China has completely infiltrated the Canadian political system and has been allowed to use Canadian soil as a launching pad for a sustained assault on America,” says Burton. At some point — we may already be there — America will have to prioritize national security concerns over trade considerations.  </p>\n<p>“In addition to the problems Trump identified, he cannot be happy that Canada’s loose banking regulations have made it a haven for money laundering,” Burton, now at the Sinopsis think tank, notes. “Transnational criminal enterprises involved in drug smuggling therefore find Canada a highly desirable venue to base operations.” </p>\n\n<p>“Canada can no longer take the United States for granted,”<a href=\"https://x.com/jeancharest_/status/1882552730784534772?s=61\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> wrote Jean Charest</a>, the former Canadian deputy prime minister, on Jan. 23. “President Trump is forcing us to take a hard look at ourselves — how we manage our economy, work across provinces, and define our place in the world.”</p>\n<p>Trump, who has set his sights on expanding America’s boundaries, keeps on talking about annexing Canada as<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-canada-would-have-no-tariffs-51st-state-observers-brace-trade-war\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> “our Cherished 51st State,”</a> holding out the prospect of tariff-free trade if Ottawa agrees to surrender sovereignty.  </p>\n<p>Trade friction is not ideal, of course, but Trump had to do something. Trudeau until Monday afternoon was not serious about dealing with America’s legitimate national security concerns. </p>\n\n<p><em>Gordon G.

It is, for all intents and purposes, a paid early retirement program with no strings attached. Facing mounting uncertainty, a hostile workplace environment and the erosion of once-ironclad civil service protections, thousands of employees will see this as their best or perhaps only chance to leave on their own terms before being pushed out under harsher conditions later.</p>\n<p>Those most likely to accept the offer will be the most experienced, highly skilled federal employees, who know their value and have private-sector options — the ones with the most institutional knowledge, the backbone of the federal government.</p>\n<p>The consequences of this mass exodus will not be felt immediately. That’s what makes this such a dangerous, slow-moving disaster. On paper, the government will still have these employees on the payroll, but in reality, they will be ghost employees — paid but absent, receiving full compensation while contributing nothing. This will create a facade of normalcy, obscuring the full extent of the crisis. </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>And then, in October 2025, the storm will hit all at once.</p>\n<p>The government will wake up to a crisis of its own making. Agencies will be hollowed out. The loss of institutional knowledge will paralyze essential services. Programs that millions of Americans rely on will be understaffed, backlogged, and dysfunctional. Taxpayers will be paying for a government that barely works.</p>\n\n<p>Social Security and Medicare processing will grind to a crawl. The employees who handle retirement benefits, disability claims and health care subsidies aren’t easily replaced. These are complex systems requiring years of experience to navigate. As experts walk out the door, the wait times will stretch from weeks to months. People who depend on these programs — seniors, disabled Americans, low-income families — will be left in limbo, waiting for an answer that may never come.</p>\n<p>Homeland Security and intelligence agencies will be severely weakened. The analysts and cybersecurity experts responsible for monitoring threats and protecting national security will disappear, leaving critical gaps in oversight. With fewer trained professionals tracking threats, adversaries will have more opportunities to exploit vulnerabilities. Cyberattacks will become harder to prevent. Terrorism investigations will take longer. The risks will multiply, and the consequences could be catastrophic.</p>\n<p>Federal law enforcement will suffer. The FBI, DEA, and ATF all depend on experienced agents who know how to handle complex investigations. If enough of them take the deferred resignation, cases will stall. Organized crime, drug trafficking, and corruption probes will face delays or be abandoned altogether. Criminals who would have been prosecuted may walk free, simply because there aren’t enough agents left to follow through.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Businesses will seriously suffer. A weakened federal workforce means regulatory guidance will be inconsistent, approvals will slow, and critical permitting processes will stall. Companies waiting on clearances, permits, and approvals will face indefinite delays. Infrastructure projects will be held up due to bureaucratic bottlenecks, stalling economic growth. </p>\n<p>Financial markets will see increased volatility as oversight agencies struggle to enforce compliance, creating uncertainty for investors. Without clear regulatory direction, corporations will be forced to navigate shifting policies blindly, increasing legal risks and operational inefficiencies. The absence of a functioning government will be an economic drag, not a relief.</p>\n<p>When these failures start piling up, the government will try to hire replacements. But who will want these jobs? Who will step into a system that has just sent its best employees packing? The reputation of federal employment will be shattered. Hiring will be slow and difficult. The government will be forced to rely on underqualified applicants who take the job as a last resort. Mistakes will multiply. The expertise lost in 2025 will take decades to rebuild, if it ever returns at all.</p>\n\n<p>And through it all, taxpayers will continue footing the bill for a government that can no longer fulfill its basic responsibilities. They will pay the salaries of employees who no longer work, and then they will pay again for the inefficiencies, errors, and delays that result from their departure.</p>\n<p>This is not a budget-cutting measure. This is not about efficiency. This is a deliberate erosion of federal capacity, carried out under the pretense of giving employees a choice.</p>\n<p>By the time the consequences are fully visible, it will be too late. Government does not rebuild easily. The institutions that fail in 2025 will not recover in a year, nor even in a decade. This is not a short-term disruption. This is a permanent shift, a dismantling of government functions that have been built over generations.</p>\n\n<p>The administration will claim victory. They will point to cost savings, to fewer employees on the books, to a streamlined government. But what they will not say is that the services Americans rely on will be weaker, slower, and less effective. When disaster strikes, the response will be inadequate. When people need help, they will be met with delays and confusion.</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>Trump’s legacy will not escape the consequences.</p>\n<p>This is a slow-motion collapse — a train wreck happening in real time.

His motivation to make trouble for his domestic political rivals despite opening information to foreign adversaries was illustrated during the 2016 election campaign when <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/us/politics/trump-russia-clinton-emails.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">he urged</a> Russia to hack into Hillary Clinton’s email — which the Russians in fact did shortly afterward. </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/18/us-intelligence-trump-putin-threat\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">attraction</a> to the regime of Russian President Vladimir Putin is highly relevant to the problem of safeguarding U.S. secrets. His <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/trumps-threat-us-intelligence\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">animus</a> toward the U.S. intelligence community, motivated in large part by the community <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">addressing Russia’s election interference</a> that helped to elect Trump in 2016, is also relevant, because the community produces much of the most sensitive classified material. A low regard for the intelligence agencies encourages a low regard for the need to safeguard their product. </p>\n<p>On this, as on other matters, the example set by Trump will be followed by his appointees.  </p>\n\n<p>One way Trump’s director of the Central Intelligence Agency, John Ratcliffe, demonstrated his fealty to Trump during his earlier tenure as director of national intelligence was to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/18/us-intelligence-trump-putin-threat\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">declassify and release publicly</a> a Russian document for no apparent purpose, other than that it suggested Clinton was behind any perceived connection between Trump’s campaign and Russia. Ratcliffe made the disclosure notwithstanding any threat to intelligence sources and methods and despite the document’s contents being unverified and possibly Russian disinformation. </p>\n<p>The Trump team’s careless approach to safeguarding sensitive information was apparent even before the president’s return to office. His transition team <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/18/federal-officials-nervous-about-sending-data-to-trump-transition-private-emails-00195217\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">used private email</a> to discuss government business with officials of the outgoing administration — a practice for which Trump in an earlier campaign, had <a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-donald-j-trump-hillary-clintons-bad-judgment-and-the-rigged-system\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">castigated</a> Clinton. Trump’s adviser, Elon Musk, is a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/opinion/elon-musk-china-classified-secrets-national-security-russia-doge.html?searchResultPosition=1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">security risk</a> on multiple grounds, and Musk’s company SpaceX has a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/technology/elon-musk-spacex-national-security-reporting.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">poor record</a> of compliance with procedures designed to safeguard government secrets. </p>\n<p>A disdain for protecting the nation’s secrets leads to a permissive posture toward leakers. “I love WikiLeaks,” <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/300327-trump-i-love-wikileaks/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">proclaimed</a> Trump during his 2016 campaign, because among the wholesale disclosures by WikiLeaks of U.S. classified information was material that caused problems for Clinton, his political opponent at the time. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Several influential people in Trump’s circle are urging him to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/12/04/trump-pardon-edward-snowden-gaetz/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pardon Edward Snowden</a>, the contract employee of the National Security Agency who committed the largest leak ever of top-secret information about the nation’s signals intelligence programs. Trump has said he <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-close-pardoning-julian-assange-edward-snowden-candace-owens-1662153\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">came close</a> to granting a pardon during his first term. </p>\n<p>Snowden’s disclosures went far beyond any controversial domestic activities and included copious material about NSA’s normal mission of collecting foreign intelligence. Who benefitted and who was harmed by Snowden’s actions is demonstrated by his placing himself in the hands of Russia and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/02/edward-snowden-gets-russian-passport-after-swearing-oath-of-allegiance\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">accepting Russian citizenship</a>. Snowden is a <a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/blog/paul-pillar/snowdens-treason-9020\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">traitor</a> — even though Trump’s nominee to be director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/01/30/tulsi-gabbard-edward-snowden-traitor\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">refused to acknowledge it</a> at her confirmation hearing.</p>\n<p>The main immediate harms of the new administration’s handling of classified information include the loss of intelligence sources and methods, which can include the death of human agents. Foreign adversaries gain valuable knowledge about U.S. intelligence, military and other capabilities. Any compromise of classified material makes foreign partners in critical liaison relationships less willing to share their information with the U.S. — as I saw happen during my intelligence career following earlier leaks.</p>\n\n<p>Trump’s carelessness in handling the nation’s secrets and his encouragement of leakers promotes a further breakdown of discipline in the ranks. That leads to still more leaks and more unauthorized disclosures, which multiplies the harms. </p>\n<p><em>Paul R. Pillar is former national intelligence officer for the Near East and South Asia.
