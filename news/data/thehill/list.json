The legislative branch started to resemble the one we have today, in which partisan allegiances, not preserving the power of Congress, determined whether a president’s ambitions would be checked or not.      </p>\n\n<p>Aside from that mid-1970s spasm of congressional dignity, that has been the story for most of the modern era. When then-President Biden took liberties on student loans or eviction moratoriums, a Democratic-controlled Congress cheered him on. Now, Trump is taking even more audacious actions and the Republicans in power are mostly willing to let him have his way.</p>\n<p>Can Trump refuse to spend money as required by law? Can he shut down agencies duly created by Congress? Can he fire employees protected by civil service laws? Can he put the entire system of federal payments under the control of a campaign donor who has never sat for a confirmation hearing? Democrats say no, while most Republicans look at their shoes and repeat the mantra of the Trump era: “We’ll see what happens …”</p>\n<p>So to the courts we will go. And that’s where things may tend to get very interesting. </p>\n\n<p>While progressives have long and loudly lamented the direction of the current Supreme Court on matters of executive privilege, the left has given less notice to the overall trend of balancing power of the Roberts Court.

But a source told The Hill on Monday that the vote will not take place this week amid jockeying among Republicans over how deep the spending cuts should ultimately be.</p>\n\n<p>“There will not be a budget resolution markup this week,” the source said. “Leadership provided an ambitious timeline and the House is doing the best it can to meet that.”</p>\n<p>The decision to delay the markup comes after leadership presented lawmakers with a framework that proposed $500 billion in spending cuts, Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), a member of the House Budget Committee, told The Hill. The blueprint came after Johnson last week said he wanted that number to be a “floor” and not a “ceiling” to give committees flexibility when crafting the ultimate bill, which is subject to strict budget reconciliation rules.</p>\n<p>But Norman — who is also a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus — called that figure a “nonstarter,” and he said he is pushing for a bottom-line figure between $2 trillion and $5 trillion.</p>\n<p>“I’d like it higher because I just don’t have any confidence that if we set a floor of X billion, which doesn’t begin to solve our math problem,” Norman said. “I know $500 billion is a nonstarter, but whether we can get what amount as a level is, in my world it’s just got to be there.”</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>“It’s about the numbers now,” he later added. “And it’s about not having expectations so low that it doesn’t give incentive to really make a difference now that we’ve got a chance.”</p>\n<p>The early obstacle for the GOP’s sweeping legislation — which Republicans say will include an extension of tax cuts, border enforcement funding and energy priorities — is a concerning sign for Johnson as he looks to send the bill to Trump’s desk by Easter or Memorial Day, a timeline some Republicans admit will be difficult to achieve.</p>\n\n<p>One source blamed House GOP leadership for the hang-up, faulting top lawmakers for proposing a small figure when it came to spending cuts.</p>\n<p>“It is very clear that a single, big-bill budget resolution is not going to move this week,” the source said before news broke of the markup delay. “That is a direct consequence of the leadership putting forward literally deficit increases on the floor last week, and then bumping that number up to something south of $600 billion, which is demonstrably short of the cuts necessary to achieve at least deficit neutrality.”</p>\n<p>Republicans are looking to pass the Trump agenda measure through a process known as budget reconciliation, which will allow the GOP to circumvent Democratic opposition in the Senate.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Before crafting the actual bill, however, lawmakers must advance a budget resolution — which lays out the parameters of the legislation — through the Budget Committee, on which a host of hard-line conservatives sit and have the power to thwart any effort. Legislation needs majority support in the committee before heading to the House floor for a vote of the entire chamber.</p>\n<p>A number of Freedom Caucus members sit on the Budget Committee, including Norman and Reps. Ben Cline (R-Va.), Chip Roy (R-Texas), Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) and Josh Brecheen (R-Okla.).</p>\n<p>Cline told The Hill on Monday lawmakers are working to move the budget resolution “as soon as possible” but are acutely aware of the little room for error they have amid a razor-thin majority.</p>\n\n<p>The bloc of hard-liners on the Budget Committee has enough power in numbers to block the resolution from advancing. And if the resolution does eventually hit the House floor, Republicans will have little — maybe even zero — room for error. When Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) departs the House to serve as the Trump administration’s ambassador to the U.N., which is expected to happen soon, Republicans will not be able to afford any defections on party-line measures.</p>\n<p>“We want to ensure that we’re all united behind the product,” Cline told The Hill, “and with our margin as thin as we have, we gotta measure twice and cut once, as we say.”</p>\n<p>The debate about how much to slash federal spending to offset Trump’s priorities on border, tax and other ideas is partly why the Freedom Caucus has been calling to split the reconciliation bill into two parts. That strategy would allow Republicans to quickly deliver on some of Trump’s border priorities while they figure out the trickier tax portion later in the year. But those who favor the one-bill track see risks in isolating the tax portion of the agenda and leaving it until later. </p>\n\n<p>Johnson, for his part, acknowledged concerns about the cost of Trump’s legislative priorities on “Fox &amp; Friends” on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSHw7d_PLxM\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Monday morning</a>, saying that Republicans are searching for savings to offset the price tag on the cuts. </p>\n<p>“We don’t want to blow a hole in the deficit by extending the Trump-era tax cuts, for example,” Johnson said. “But we’re definitely going to get that extended. So we’ve got to find those savings.”</p>\n<p>Jonson talked about actions outside the bill that could count as “savings” — such as income from new tariffs implemented by Trump and savings that result from changes made at the direction of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the Elon Musk-headed commission within the White House. </p>\n\n<p>“The tariffs are going to bring in revenue. We’re going to have massive savings by making government more efficient and effective,” Johnson said. </p>\n<p>But those kinds of external actions would not be counted as part of a traditional assessment of the budget resolution’s fiscal impact in a Congressional Budget Office score of the bill — and attempts by GOP leaders to count those extraneous moves as “savings” against the costly items in the budget resolution risk infuriating fiscal hawks who are looking for substantial cuts as part of the Trump agenda.</p>\n<p>Still, Johnson said during a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npMnkgW8SZ4\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fireside chat</a> with The Hill at the GOP retreat last week that he would like the reconciliation package to be deficit-neutral, and that he would prefer it to be deficit reducing.</p>\n\n<p>“That is a commitment we have. Why?” Johnson said. “Because the number one threat to our nation right now is our debt. It’s not China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea, it’s the debt, and we take that very seriously.”</p>\n</div>",

The two chambers of Congress are not bystanders, Dent said.</p>\n<p>“March 14, the government must be funded. Republicans will need a lot of Democrats to help them pass a funding bill, and I suspect Democrats are going to make a lot of demands, like making sure that the monies that have been appropriated be sent as designated or as ordered by Congress,” he continued.</p>\n<p>Dent said he thinks GOP lawmakers are under a lot of stress amid the changes.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>“I’m just waiting for the dam to break,” he said. “I think a number of them are going to have to speak our forcefully on this rather soon.”</p>\n<p>While Dent didn’t hold back on his criticism of the USAID changes, many Republican lawmakers are backing Trump over the matter.</p>\n<p>Sen.

Thom Tillis (R-N.C.). “But you got to look at the reality that Mexico, it caught their attention and they’re sending troops [to the border.]”</p>\n<p>Tillis said Trump won this round with Canada and Mexico but warned that “sustained tariffs” would create a lot of economic damage.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>“I think sustained tariffs never work.

In other words, it will be paid for by American consumers. I mean, why would you want to get into a fight with your allies over this?” McConnell warned.</p>\n<p>The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board on Friday called Trump’s proposed tariffs “the dumbest trade war in history.”</p>\n<p>The Journal warned that the tariffs would hurt the domestic automobile industry, which depends heavily on Canadian and Mexican suppliers, and “cause mayhem in the cross-border trade in farm goods.”</p>\n\n<p>Other Republican lawmakers declined to talk much about Trump’s high-stakes showdown with major trading partners, knowing he plans to threaten tariffs against European trading partners next.</p>\n<p>“Pause, we’re on pause,” said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), whose home state sends 30 percent of its exports, such as alcohol and tractors, to Canada, and another 20 percent to Mexico.</p>\n<p>When Republican lawmakers heard of Trump’s threat over the weekend to slap steep tariffs on nearly $1 trillion in imported goods and services, they hoped the president was maneuvering for negotiating leverage instead of digging in for a prolonged trade war.</p>\n\n<p>“The best tariffs are the ones never applied,” said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).</p>\n<p>“Using them as leverage to open discussion and try to convince countries to do something, they obviously have great value. It’s hard to argue with that. If they’re ever put in place, they’ll be a disaster for our economy. So I hope we don’t do that,” he said.</p>\n<p>Paul said Mexico has needed to put more of its army along the largely lawless U.S.-Mexico border for years.</p>\n\n<p>Other GOP lawmakers breathed a sigh of relief after Trump announced the pause, which immediately buoyed the stock markets.</p>\n<p>“Good news on Mexico tariff pause for 1 month,” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) posted on the social media site X. “Hopefully negotiating will preempt more talk of tariffs.”</p>\n<p>The Iowa senator had pleaded with Trump earlier in the day to exempt Canadian potash shipments from tariffs.</p>\n\n<p>“Biden inflation increase the input cost to farming by 20 percent [including] particularly high prices on fertilizer,” Grassley <a href=\"https://x.com/ChuckGrassley/status/1886408592477102422\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">posted on</a> the social platform X. “So I plead [with] President Trump to exempt potash from the tariff because family farmers get most of our potash from Canada.”</p>\n<p>Other GOP lawmakers said Trump’s tough approach worked, even if it gave them some heartburn over the weekend.</p>\n<p>“Looks like it worked,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said of Trump’s tariff threat.</p>\n\n<p>“I think that’s good that we got some cooperation from Mexico and didn’t have to use the high tariffs,” he said.</p>\n<p>But Cornyn, whose home state engaged with $272 billion in trade with Mexico in 2023, acknowledged no one knows what to expect after the 30-day pause expires.</p>\n<p>“If you knew that, you should pick a lottery ticket,” he said.</p>\n<p>Even before Trump and Trudeau reached their deal to pause tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods imported from Mexico, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) signaled he didn’t expect the tariffs to go into effect for any sustained period of time.</p>\n<p>“We’ll see how long” they last, Thune told reporters when asked for his reaction to Trump’s tariff threats Monday afternoon.</p>\n<p>“It sounds like the Mexican tariffs are already being paused,” he noted. “We’ll see what happens.”</p>\n</div>",

It is not persuasive in any way. There’s nothing wrong with President Trump appointing someone who seriously defended him to a high position. Ms. Bondi publicly supported President Trump, just like 77 million Americans who voted him back into office in November. So this too is not a disqualifying attribute.”</p>\n</div>",

Navarro, who was in prison for defying a congressional subpoena, argued that the fentanyl crisis in the country was dire because it impacted the nation’s “prime working” demographic.</p>\n\n<p>“This is carnage. We’ve kind of grown immune to the fact that 200 Americans die every single day, every single day, at the hands [of fentanyl,]” he said.</p>\n<p>He noted that fentanyl was the leading cause of death for 18-45-year-olds</p>\n<p>“We’re having our economy hollowed out, in part, by these deaths,” Navarro continued. “So, I’m confident that President Trump is going to get this job done.”</p>\n</div>",
