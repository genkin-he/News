Eric Smith said in the release. “Make no mistake, passing an audit makes us more ready to fight when our nation calls.”</p>\n<p>A clean audit for $49 billion in financial assets means the Marine Corps is able to track and report transactions across the globe and keep stock of inventory equipment and assets at Marine facilities in the past fiscal year. It also means the service can better plan, program and budget the spending of congressionally appropriated funds.</p>\n<p>The report comes after the Pentagon in November failed to pass its seventh full audit in a row. The Defense Department, which has a more than $824 billion annual budget, said it has made progress in working toward a clean audit by fiscal year 2028 — when Congress mandates it to do so — but has yet to pass across the board. The federal agency has held an audit ever since 2018, when it became legally obligated to carry them out.</p>\n<p>While DOD technically earned a disclaimer of opinion — meaning it failed to provide sufficient information to auditors to form an accurate opinion — Pentagon comptroller <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/michael-mccord/\">Michael McCord</a> said at the time that the agency “has turned a corner in its understanding of the depth and breadth of its challenges.”</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>The failed audits have prompted lawmakers to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5032747-sessions-watchdog-pentagon-audit-failures/\">call for increased oversight</a> of the Pentagon.</p>\n</div>",

Brandon Gill (R-Texas) has called for deporting Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), a U.S. citizen, back to her country of birth, Somalia. </p>\n<p>“America would be a better place if @IlhanMN were deported back to Somalia,” Gill <a href=\"https://x.com/RepBrandonGill/status/1886844342330872198\">wrote</a> Tuesday on X. </p>\n\n<p>Gill, a freshman lawmaker representing Texas’s 26th Congressional District, was responding to a clip another X user shared on Tuesday of her recent interview with a reporter. </p>\n<p>Thirty minutes later, in another post, Gill <a href=\"https://x.com/RepBrandonGill/status/1886851838013575313\">wrote</a> that “we should have never let Ilhan Omar into our country.” </p>\n<p>Omar came to the U.S. as a refugee in 1995 and became a naturalized citizen when she was 17 years old in 2000. </p>\n<p>A spokesperson for Gill told The Hill, “Representative Omar’s conduct raises questions about to whom she is most loyal- the American people or illegal aliens from Somalia. Representative Gill simply stated that it is disgraceful for a sitting Congresswoman and US citizen to facilitate the invasion of our country by illegal alien Somalis.” </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>In the clip, Omar, the first Somali-American Congressmember, outlined what Somalians who are “undocumented or who their documentation might have lapsed” should do if they are questioned by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers. </p>\n<p>“You are not obligated to answer their questions. Just state that your are advised by a lawyer not to answer questions,” Omar <a href=\"https://x.com/VancitySam/status/1886810411003187465\">told</a> the reporter. “Disclosure of your name, immigration status, and the mode of entry is not mandatory. Learn the laws and prepare yourself and refrain from disclosing information that you prefer them not to know.” </p>\n\n<p>The Minnesota Democrat faced deportation calls last year after a <a href=\"https://minnesotareformer.com/2024/02/01/republicans-smeared-ilhan-omar-over-a-faulty-translation-heres-what-she-really-said/\">mistranslated clip</a> of her speech in Somali sparked heavy backlash on the right. At the time, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) moved to censure Omar and later <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4442166-greene-omar-censure-force-vote/\">told</a> reporters that “I would love to expel her; I think she should be deported, I honestly do,” over the wrongly translated remarks. </p>\n<p>Tech billionaire and close President Trump ally Elon Musk also reacted to the Tuesday clip of Omar, <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1886827187325559269\">writing</a> Tuesday that “she is breaking the law. Literally. Outright.” </p>\n<p>“It just shows you how much he lacks an understanding of what the laws of the country are,” Omar said Tuesday when asked about Musk’s post on “CNN News Central.” </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>The Minnesota progressive said that “it is important for people to exercise their Fifth Amendment rights to remain silent unless they feel confident that they have the legal protections that they need.”</p>\n<p>“Nobody needs to put themselves at jeopardy by speaking to law enforcement if they do not have the advice of lawyers and we continue to tell people that,” she said on CNN. </p>\n<p>The Hill has reached out to Omar’s office for comment.</p>\n</div>",

Down South, we have a saying that captures the same sentiment in a different way: “A kicked dog hollers.”</p>\n\n<p>A prime example: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) <a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/leader-schumer-floor-remarks-condemning-doge-and-the-trump-administrations-illegal-seizure-of-usaid-putting-american-security-at-risk\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">is now complaining</a> about all sorts of things regarding DOGE. One of his principal objections is that DOGE has no statutory authority to do, well, anything.</p>\n<p>At one level, Schumer is technically correct. At another, more important level, he is entirely wrong.</p>\n<p>DOGE, which, in fairness started as little more than a well-oiled public relations campaign, is now a real part of the federal government. It has <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">set up shop</a> within the confines of a little-known agency, the U.S. Digital Service.</p>\n<p>Schumer should be familiar with this agency, which was created by <a href=\"https://www.usds.gov/mission\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">President Barack Obama</a>, not by Congress, back in 2014. Its original mission was to fix the healtcare.gov website, an integral part of the Affordable Care Act that had <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/a-look-back-at-technical-issues-with-healthcare-gov/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">widely acknowledged deficiencies</a> when it was first rolled out.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>It worked. In fact, the U.S. Digital Service worked so well that President Trump kept it during his first term. Its mission was essentially to find other government services that could be improved with technology.</p>\n<p>So Schumer is correct, technically, when he says the agency has no real authority. But then, neither did the U.S. Digital Service. Yet it was always able to get things done. During Trump 1.0, for example, it might call over to the Department of Veterans Affairs and offer to help fix some of the computer interfaces whereby vets sign up for benefits. </p>\n\n<p>If the department were to refuse (which legally it could do) then U.S. Digital Service could simply go to those who do have the authority — to the director of the Office of Management and Budget or to the president himself. The Trump team was all pulling in the same direction on fixing the Department of Veterans Affairs, so we didn’t have to jump through those sorts of hoops. They just agreed to work with the U.S. Digital Service, and we decreased vets’ waiting times for appointments from months under Obama to days under Trump.</p>\n<p>But that’s not the point. The point is that the U.S. Digital Service did have authority, albeit indirect, and DOGE now has that same authority.</p>\n<p>The difference now is in the agencies, not USDS/DOGE. Whereas Veterans Affairs welcomed the help, many agencies today are fiercely resisting DOGE and the transparency it brings with it. Just ask USAID.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Face it, DOGE is trying to do things no one has done before. Not that others haven’t tried. I remember asking career staff at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau if there was anyone working there who is also working another job at the same time. I was assured that there was no way for us to find out. Not being as familiar with the Deep State as I am now, I accepted that answer. </p>\n<p>DOGE is not as naive as I was, and it turns out that you can find out.   </p>\n<p>Another thing the left doesn’t like is that apparently Elon Musk and his team are “special government employees.” <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/white-house-says-elon-musk-serving-special-government-employee-rcna190520\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Various</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/politics/musk-government-employee/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">outlets</a> ran stories this week ominously touting the very sinister-sounding title. What they aren’t telling anyone is that a “special government employee” is actually a normal thing <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/202\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">defined by statute</a>. In layman’s terms, it is just a part-time government employee. Special government employees are subject to some, but not all, of the rules for regular government employees regarding financial disclosures and conflicts of interest.</p>\n\n<p>I know the left was upset when I was made a special government employee back in 2020, as the President’s Special Envoy to Northern Ireland. But I imagine that had more to do with my employer, not my job classification.</p>\n<p>More importantly, I don’t remember progressives complaining much — and I certainly don’t remember ominous stories in the media — when John Kerry was a special government employee as Special Presidential Envoy for Climate.</p>\n<p>I still think DOGE is going to struggle to save money meaningfully. Although Musk suggests he can save a trillion dollars by the end of the fiscal year, if he <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/202\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">continues on the current trend</a> it will actually take him until roughly 2065 to save that much. But that is more a function of how government, not DOGE, works. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n\n<p>Still, DOGE is now legitimate.

Trump has long sought to wipe the Department of Education (DOE) from the federal government, and, responding to one of those reports, Elon Musk said he “will succeed” where other conservatives have failed.  </p>\n\n<p>“The whole thing is absurd,” said Jon Valant, director of the Brown Center on Education Policy at the Brookings Institute, of the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5123000-education-department-dei-trump/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">staffers placed on leave</a>. </p>\n<p>While it was pinned to Trump’s anti-diversity efforts, the DOE push to forced leave “feels much more connected to” reports that Trump is looking at executive actions to weaken the department, Valant said.  </p>\n<p>“I think they are trying to squeeze the department in any way they can, to try to encourage people to leave, force people to leave, do whatever they can to shrink, destabilize and kneecap the department, knowing full well that they can’t just outright eliminate it or most of its major programs and offices without the cooperation of Congress,” he added.  </p>\n<p><a data-id=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/education-department-trump-executive-order-eeaf1cb6?mod=hp_lead_pos2\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/education-department-trump-executive-order-eeaf1cb6?mod=hp_lead_pos2\">The Wall Street Journal reported</a> Monday that Trump is looking at executive actions to cripple the Education Department, such as taking away programs not explicitly written into law, moving functions to different departments and calling for Congress to pass a law completely abolishing the federal agency.  </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Multiple people familiar with the conversations told the outlet the specifics and timing are still up for debate and the president is facing pressure from others to wait on any such orders until after the confirmation hearing for Trump’s pick for Education secretary, which has not been scheduled yet.  </p>\n<p>“I think this is going to change the conversation in Linda McMahon’s confirmation hearings,” Valant said. “Regardless, we were going to see a good amount of questioning around the future of the department. I think that looks now like it’s probably going to be the dominant part of that conversation.”</p>\n\n<p>Trump made clear in the Oval Office on Tuesday that he wants “Linda to put herself out of a job.”</p>\n<p>“I told Linda, ‘Linda, I hope you do a great job and put yourself out of a job,'” Trump said, adding he would like to end the department through executive order.</p>\n<p>“So we’re ranked number 40 out of 40 schools, right? We’re ranked number one in cost per pupil, so we spend more per pupil than any other country in the world, and we’re ranked at the bottom of the list. We’re ranked very badly. And what I want to do is let the states run schools,” the president added.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>While Trump had promised to dismantle the department in his first administration, he made little effort to keep that pledge at the time.  </p>\n<p>The tone has shifted dramatically in his second term, with Musk, the head of the unofficial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that is <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5123000-education-department-dei-trump/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">currently gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)</a> and going through other departments, confident in Trump’s efforts.  </p>\n<p>“Reagan campaigned on ending the federal Dept of Education, which was created by Carter in 1979, but it was bigger when Reagan left office than when he started!” Musk <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5125069-department-of-education-trump-musk-doge/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said in response</a> to <a data-id=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/03/trump-education-department-dismantling-executive-order-draft/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/03/trump-education-department-dismantling-executive-order-draft/\">a report from The Washington Post</a> about Trump’s potential executive actions and DOGE going through data from the federal agency. </p>\n\n<p>“Not this time. President @realDonaldTrump will succeed,” he added.  </p>\n<p>Eliminating the department would require legislative action, as some of the programs are written into law, but there are significant ways the president could weaken it, such as abolishing others, cutting down personnel, investigating programs, shifting funding or moving programs to other federal departments.  </p>\n<p>“He can’t really do a whole lot. You can’t eliminate Title I. He can’t eliminate the [Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]. There are lots of other things that he can’t just stop,” said Neil McCluskey, director for the Center for Educational Freedom at CATO Institute.        </p>\n\n<p>“I think that it’s probably within his executive power: not to eliminate the programs, but to examine them and see how they work and whether or not they’re working properly. And I imagine that will be part of the executive order,” McCluskey added. </p>\n<p>When asked about potential executive action, a White House official told The Hill that Trump “plans to fulfill a campaign promise by revaluating the future of the Department of Education.” </p>\n<p>On Friday, DOE sent letters to dozens of staffers putting them on administrative leave due to executive action Trump signed to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs from the federal government.  </p>\n\n<p>The union for the staffers said many of the targeted employees had no direct involvement in DEI but attended a DEI program back in 2019 during Trump’s first term in office that was encouraged by his then-secretary of education.  </p>\n<p>“President Trump was elected to bring about unprecedented reform to the federal civil service to ensure it is merit-based and efficient at serving the interests of the American people. At the Department of Education, we are evaluating staffing in line with the commitment to prioritizing meaningful learning ahead of divisive ideology in schools and putting student outcomes above special interests,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Communications Madi Biedermann when asked for comment about the potential executive actions by the president and placing staff on administrative leave.  </p>\n<p>Eliminating the department altogether is an idea that certainly does have its defenders on Capitol Hill.</p>\n\n<p>“To my friends who are upset, I would say with respect, call somebody who cares. You better get used to this. It’s USAID today, it’s going to be the Department of Education tomorrow,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said on Fox News this week.</p>\n<p>Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) reintroduced a bill this month in the House to eliminate DOE. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) introduced a bill with the same goal in the Senate back in November. </p>\n<p>But such a measure would have to not only clear the House, where Republicans have a razor-thin majority, also secure 60 votes in the Senate to beat a filibuster. And no Democrat in the 53-47 upper chamber has backed the idea. </p>\n\n<p>McCluskey said even more “palatable” arguments such as not eliminating DOE functions but just moving them elsewhere would “still be a tough haul, because you’d have to get Democrats.” </p>\n<p>If none of Trump’s reforms get congressional approval, advocates are concerned about the political ping-pong that could develop with the agency. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>Schools have already experienced political whiplash with <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5118925-trump-biden-title-ix-education-gender-lgbtq/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Title IX regulations</a>, having to change how they handle sexual assault cases and discrimination protections for LGBTQ students back and forth between Trump and former President Biden. </p>\n<p>“What worries me here is that we’re sort of headed down a path where we’re going to have this pendulum swing in a lot of different parts of what the federal government does when it comes to education, and I don’t think that serves anyone well and I also don’t think anyone really wants that,” Valant said.  </p>\n<p>“I don’t think there’s much appetite for having these major, major changes to the federal role in education every time we move from a Republican to a Democratic administration and back,” he added. </p>\n</div>",

A hold on arms sales to Israel signals a major flouting of convention, where U.S. military support for Israel is viewed as an investment in American national security.   </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/u-s-readies-new-1-billion-arms-sale-to-israel-6832aa26\">Wall Street Journal reported</a> that the $1 billion arms sale package for Israel includes 4,700 1,000-pound bombs, worth more than $700 million, as well as armored bulldozers built by Caterpillar, worth more than $300 million, citing U.S. officials. </p>\n<p>The hold comes as Democrats <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5119639-democrats-frustration-trump-agenda/\">have seethed</a> over Trump’s actions a little over two weeks into his presidency.

In 2019, Trump issued an emergency declaration to push through more than $8 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan without congressional approval. The Republican-controlled Senate at the time <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/saudi-arabia-arms-deal-trump-what-to-know/\">voted to block</a> the arms sale. </p>\n\n<p>Arms sales to Israel are historically bipartisan, even as Democrats have increasingly raised alarm over Israel’s war conduct in the Gaza Strip and Netanyahu’s policies toward Palestinians. </p>\n<p>Amid Israel’s war against Hamas in response to the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack, an estimated half of the nearly 47,000 Palestinian casualties are women, children and the elderly. Nearly all of the two million Gaza residents require humanitarian assistance and 90 percent are displaced among widespread destruction. </p>\n<p>Still, Democrats in positions of power did not stand in the way of President Biden sending weapons to Israel or green-lighting arms sales. In June, Biden <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4727080-top-democrats-gregory-meeks-ben-cardin-israel-hamas-war-massive-weapons-package/\">moved forward</a> on a $18 billion arms sale to Israel. </p>\n<p>Netanyahu will meet with Trump at the White House on Tuesday and is expected to visit Capitol Hill and meet with lawmakers on Wednesday. </p>\n<p>The U.S. provides about $38 billion to Israel as part of a 10-year memorandum of understanding (MOU). That amounts to $3.3 billion in foreign military financing — generally a credit for Israel to purchase weapons systems in the U.S. and $500 million for missile defense programs annually. The MOU runs through fiscal year 2028 and will need to be renewed in 2029. </p>\n</div>",
