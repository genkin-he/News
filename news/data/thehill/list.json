Trump’s strategy of dismantling USAID amid a flurry of executive orders is almost certainly an <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/foreign-aid/5123972-lawmakers-legal-experts-warn-shuttering-usaid-is-unconstitutional/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">illegal exercise of powers </a>reserved for Congress.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t mean it won’t work. </p>\n\n<p>Trump’s first two weeks in office have been an unparalleled attack on the separation of executive and legislative power. Not only has Trump falsely claimed the power to <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-orders-temporary-funding-freeze-that-could-affect-trillions-of-dollars\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“freeze” spending</a> already appropriated by Congress — effectively a line item veto on steroids — his closure of USAID is a direct attack on congressional authority. Even so, good luck finding a <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/02/03/2025/usaids-breakup-sparks-little-outcry-from-even-pro-foreign-aid-republicans\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">single Capitol Hill Republican</a> willing to defend Congress’s equal status in this governing partnership. </p>\n<p>Trump’s latest threat, to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/03/trump-finalizing-plans-shutter-education-department-00202225\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">shutter the Department of Education,</a> is written in the language of a president convinced he stands above the constitutional order. Our congressional leaders must send a message to the White House by fiercely defending their legal authority to decide the future of USAID. As history has too often shown, powers seized by the White House are almost never given back to their original owners. </p>\n<p>Even in a political culture where truth evaporates at room temperature, the law is clear. Despite starting its life by executive order under President John F. Kennedy in 1961, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5124147-trump-musk-usaid-attacks/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Congress codified USAID</a> as an official independent agency in the 1998 Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act. Republicans may think USAID is one big liberal slush fund, but it’s clearly up to Congress — not the White House — to determine the scope of the agency.  </p>\n<p>The specific threat posed by Trump’s power grab is one our Founders knew well. The issue was clearly on their mind during the drafting of the Constitution in 1787, having just fought a bloody war to free themselves from an overbearing executive. In fact, concerns about a president seizing legislative powers — especially the power of the purse — <a href=\"https://csac.history.wisc.edu/document-collections/constitutional-debates/executive-branch/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dominated the media discourse of the day</a>. How little has changed.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>The scenes outside USAID headquarters this week may have lacked the drama of the Boston Massacre, but what was going on inside was equally revolutionary. It was there that Trump ally and megadonor Elon Musk directed officials to be locked out of their offices and refused entry to the building. “Spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper,” Musk would later <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5122676-usaid-shutdown-elon-musk-doge/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gloat on X.</a></p>\n<p>Nobody in Republican circles seemed concerned that Musk, who faces no form of congressional oversight, had been given unrestricted access to the Treasury Department’s <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/treasury-dept-elon-musks-team-access-federal-payment/story?id=118380399\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sensitive payment system</a> as a means to further choke off USAID funds. Nor did a single Republican lawmaker speak up when Musk voiced the extreme legal theory that Trump could <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/trump-elon-musk-deleting-government-agencies-usaid-1235254897/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dissolve any agency or department he wanted</a> without consulting Congress.  </p>\n\n<p>The framers of our Constitution wisely agreed that if the president had a problem with a law passed by Congress, he could persuade and cajole them to reform or repeal the law. It was, crucially, a transparent process meant to play out in full view of the public. Our founders both anticipated and explicitly took steps to prevent the type of unilateral action Trump just unleashed on USAID. Their only failing was expecting Congress to jealously guard its power instead of willingly surrendering it to the president. </p>\n<p>As is so common in Trumpian schemes, the end result is legal and organizational chaos. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday declared himself <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/politics/usaid-washington-workers/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">acting director of USAID</a> and announced a plan for the State Department to absorb whatever parts of USAID Musk doesn’t evaporate entirely. That must come with some bitterness for Rubio, who was once one of the Senate’s <a href=\"https://www.devex.com/news/us-sens-kaine-and-rubio-back-bill-to-diversify-usaid-funding-100491\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">leading USAID expansionists</a>.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the Senate’s weak-willed Republicans think the federal courts will bail them out by ordering injunctions on Trump’s orders. That would certainly spare lawmakers the unpleasantness of disagreeing with Trump in public. But the Supreme Court’s recent <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/supreme-court-grants-trump-broad-immunity-for-official-acts-placing-presidents-above-the-law\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rulings broadly expanding executive power</a> aren’t reassuring. The courts simply can’t be counted on to uphold the constitutional balance of power. Congress will need to do this heavy lifting itself. </p>\n<p>Trump’s indefensible power grab at USAID, and his similar plans for the Department of Education, should give all lawmakers cause to reflect on their oath of office and what it means to serve our Constitution and our country. More than ever before, the American people need and deserve a strong Congress to check and balance Trump’s increasingly authoritarian White House.</p>\n<p><em>Max Burns is a veteran Democratic strategist and founder of Third Degree Strategies.</em>  </p>\n</div>",

But his words could just as easily apply to President Trump, Elon Musk and the parade of Republicans who have unleashed so much chaos these last few weeks.</p>\n<p>If you’re watching <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5122521-musk-trump-agreed-usaid-should-be-shut-down/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Musk gut USAID</a> like it’s a Black Friday sale, or Trump going full Bond villain <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5114471-trump-milley-security-revoked/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on Gen. Mark Milley</a>, or <a href=\"https://x.com/JonahDispatch/status/1886552460111614191\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">appointing white supremacists</a> like he’s assembling an evil Justice League — I get it. I do. But don’t act surprised.</p>\n\n<p>Trump kicked off his 2024 campaign with the word “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/06/trumps-dark-i-am-your-retribution-pledge-how-gop-enabled-it/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">retribution</a>.” That was the pitch. Not unity, not hope, not even a catchy jingle — just straight-up vengeance.</p>\n<p>And guess what? He’s delivering. He said he was going to burn it all down, and now people are shocked there’s smoke?</p>\n<p>Amazingly, Trump (or, more precisely, his minions) literally wrote their whole playbook. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/31/politics/trump-policy-project-2025-executive-orders-invs/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CNN reported</a> that, of the 53 executive orders and actions Trump signed during his first week in office, 36 were straight out of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation document referenced frequently during the campaign.</p>\n<p>As a buddy of mine (not known for pulling punches) quipped, it’s like “Mein Kampf” meets an oil lobbyist’s PowerPoint. The playbook is set. And now, it’s merely execution time — figuratively, of course.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Say what you will about Trump, but he never tried to hide his agenda or his style. Yet, despite his utter transparency — not to mention that he already gave us a four-year sample of what he would be like as president — some people really do seem surprised. This is sort of like dating a stripper named Cashmere and then being stunned to learn that she is seeing other guys on the side.</p>\n<p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://x.com/ForecasterEnten/status/1886425365507141815\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to CNN’s Harry Enten,</a> just 1 to 2 percent of people surveyed think Trump should focus on tariffs, and more people were Googling “tariffs” than Taylor Swift.</p>\n\n<p>But why? During his campaign, Trump constantly talked about raising tariffs, saying it would do everything from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/us/politics/trump-michigan-town-hall-tariffs.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">revitalize the auto industry</a> to pay for childcare. “We are going to be taking in trillions of dollars. And as much as child care is talked about as being expensive, it is relatively speaking not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers we’ll be taking in,” <a href=\"https://wtop.com/business-finance/2024/09/trump-and-harris-lay-out-starkly-different-views-of-the-economy-starting-with-corporate-taxes/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">he said last September</a> at the Economic Club of New York.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the only surprise was that, after threatening to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico, he suddenly swerved and decided not to. Folks, <a href=\"https://x.com/scottlincicome/status/1861216180134125582\">that’s</a><a href=\"https://x.com/scottlincicome/status/1861216180134125582\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> the pattern</a> — the old bait and switch.</p>\n<p>But here’s what really gets me: It’s not just the clueless voters who didn’t see this coming. It’s the people who did see it coming, and are still flipping out every time he does something nuts. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>I get it — staying outraged keeps the resistance alive. But at some point, outrage starts to sound like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxnpY0owPkA\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Captain Renault in “Casablanca”</a>: “I’m shocked — shocked — to find that gambling is going on in this establishment!” Meanwhile, Trump is handing out chips to his supporters.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say everyone should go along with the craziness, or that we should just roll over and tune out so as to preserve our sanity. There may indeed be some calculated strategic benefit to “performative outrage.” If nothing else, maybe it will slow Trump down a bit. Or maybe it will position Trump’s rivals to capitalize if and when some exogenous event comes along and upends MAGA’s best-laid plans.</p>\n<p>My main point, however, is that whether you were ignorant, naive or utterly freaked out about the possibility of another four years of Trumpian madness, nothing that is happening right now should come as a surprise.</p>\n\n<p>If you were counting on “norms” and “institutions” to rein him in, you weren’t listening to the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-01-14/trump-inauguration-democracy-guardrails\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">many warnings</a> we gave you, explaining that Trump and his team would be better positioned in a second term to work around those norms and institutions.</p>\n<p>And if you thought sensible Republican politicians would somehow stop him, then you obviously weren’t paying attention to how Trump had systematically purged or tamed them all. Right now, they seem poised to rubber-stamp Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard into the Cabinet.</p>\n<p>We are now getting exactly what we voted for, exactly what we were promised and (presumably) exactly what we deserve.</p>\n\n<p>And if you’re wondering why I can so flippantly make light of things that are so shocking and new — to the degree that I was in mourning, it all happened on Election Day in November.</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>Everything after that?
