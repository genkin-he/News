Down South, we have a saying that captures the same sentiment in a different way: “A kicked dog hollers.”</p>\n\n<p>A prime example: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) <a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/leader-schumer-floor-remarks-condemning-doge-and-the-trump-administrations-illegal-seizure-of-usaid-putting-american-security-at-risk\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">is now complaining</a> about all sorts of things regarding DOGE. One of his principal objections is that DOGE has no statutory authority to do, well, anything.</p>\n<p>At one level, Schumer is technically correct. At another, more important level, he is entirely wrong.</p>\n<p>DOGE, which, in fairness started as little more than a well-oiled public relations campaign, is now a real part of the federal government. It has <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">set up shop</a> within the confines of a little-known agency, the U.S. Digital Service.</p>\n<p>Schumer should be familiar with this agency, which was created by <a href=\"https://www.usds.gov/mission\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">President Barack Obama</a>, not by Congress, back in 2014. Its original mission was to fix the healtcare.gov website, an integral part of the Affordable Care Act that had <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/a-look-back-at-technical-issues-with-healthcare-gov/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">widely acknowledged deficiencies</a> when it was first rolled out.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>It worked. In fact, the U.S. Digital Service worked so well that President Trump kept it during his first term. Its mission was essentially to find other government services that could be improved with technology.</p>\n<p>So Schumer is correct, technically, when he says the agency has no real authority. But then, neither did the U.S. Digital Service. Yet it was always able to get things done. During Trump 1.0, for example, it might call over to the Department of Veterans Affairs and offer to help fix some of the computer interfaces whereby vets sign up for benefits. </p>\n\n<p>If the department were to refuse (which legally it could do) then U.S. Digital Service could simply go to those who do have the authority — to the director of the Office of Management and Budget or to the president himself. The Trump team was all pulling in the same direction on fixing the Department of Veterans Affairs, so we didn’t have to jump through those sorts of hoops. They just agreed to work with the U.S. Digital Service, and we decreased vets’ waiting times for appointments from months under Obama to days under Trump.</p>\n<p>But that’s not the point. The point is that the U.S. Digital Service did have authority, albeit indirect, and DOGE now has that same authority.</p>\n<p>The difference now is in the agencies, not USDS/DOGE. Whereas Veterans Affairs welcomed the help, many agencies today are fiercely resisting DOGE and the transparency it brings with it. Just ask USAID.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Face it, DOGE is trying to do things no one has done before. Not that others haven’t tried. I remember asking career staff at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau if there was anyone working there who is also working another job at the same time. I was assured that there was no way for us to find out. Not being as familiar with the Deep State as I am now, I accepted that answer. </p>\n<p>DOGE is not as naive as I was, and it turns out that you can find out.   </p>\n<p>Another thing the left doesn’t like is that apparently Elon Musk and his team are “special government employees.” <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/white-house-says-elon-musk-serving-special-government-employee-rcna190520\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Various</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/politics/musk-government-employee/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">outlets</a> ran stories this week ominously touting the very sinister-sounding title. What they aren’t telling anyone is that a “special government employee” is actually a normal thing <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/202\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">defined by statute</a>. In layman’s terms, it is just a part-time government employee. Special government employees are subject to some, but not all, of the rules for regular government employees regarding financial disclosures and conflicts of interest.</p>\n\n<p>I know the left was upset when I was made a special government employee back in 2020, as the President’s Special Envoy to Northern Ireland. But I imagine that had more to do with my employer, not my job classification.</p>\n<p>More importantly, I don’t remember progressives complaining much — and I certainly don’t remember ominous stories in the media — when John Kerry was a special government employee as Special Presidential Envoy for Climate.</p>\n<p>I still think DOGE is going to struggle to save money meaningfully. Although Musk suggests he can save a trillion dollars by the end of the fiscal year, if he <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/202\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">continues on the current trend</a> it will actually take him until roughly 2065 to save that much. But that is more a function of how government, not DOGE, works. </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n\n<p>Still, DOGE is now legitimate.

Trump has long sought to wipe the Department of Education (DOE) from the federal government, and, responding to one of those reports, Elon Musk said he “will succeed” where other conservatives have failed.  </p>\n\n<p>“The whole thing is absurd,” said Jon Valant, director of the Brown Center on Education Policy at the Brookings Institute, of the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5123000-education-department-dei-trump/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">staffers placed on leave</a>. </p>\n<p>While it was pinned to Trump’s anti-diversity efforts, the DOE push to forced leave “feels much more connected to” reports that Trump is looking at executive actions to weaken the department, Valant said.  </p>\n<p>“I think they are trying to squeeze the department in any way they can, to try to encourage people to leave, force people to leave, do whatever they can to shrink, destabilize and kneecap the department, knowing full well that they can’t just outright eliminate it or most of its major programs and offices without the cooperation of Congress,” he added.  </p>\n<p><a data-id=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/education-department-trump-executive-order-eeaf1cb6?mod=hp_lead_pos2\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/education-department-trump-executive-order-eeaf1cb6?mod=hp_lead_pos2\">The Wall Street Journal reported</a> Monday that Trump is looking at executive actions to cripple the Education Department, such as taking away programs not explicitly written into law, moving functions to different departments and calling for Congress to pass a law completely abolishing the federal agency.  </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Multiple people familiar with the conversations told the outlet the specifics and timing are still up for debate and the president is facing pressure from others to wait on any such orders until after the confirmation hearing for Trump’s pick for Education secretary, which has not been scheduled yet.  </p>\n<p>“I think this is going to change the conversation in Linda McMahon’s confirmation hearings,” Valant said. “Regardless, we were going to see a good amount of questioning around the future of the department. I think that looks now like it’s probably going to be the dominant part of that conversation.”</p>\n\n<p>Trump made clear in the Oval Office on Tuesday that he wants “Linda to put herself out of a job.”</p>\n<p>“I told Linda, ‘Linda, I hope you do a great job and put yourself out of a job,'” Trump said, adding he would like to end the department through executive order.</p>\n<p>“So we’re ranked number 40 out of 40 schools, right? We’re ranked number one in cost per pupil, so we spend more per pupil than any other country in the world, and we’re ranked at the bottom of the list. We’re ranked very badly. And what I want to do is let the states run schools,” the president added.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>While Trump had promised to dismantle the department in his first administration, he made little effort to keep that pledge at the time.  </p>\n<p>The tone has shifted dramatically in his second term, with Musk, the head of the unofficial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that is <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5123000-education-department-dei-trump/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">currently gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)</a> and going through other departments, confident in Trump’s efforts.  </p>\n<p>“Reagan campaigned on ending the federal Dept of Education, which was created by Carter in 1979, but it was bigger when Reagan left office than when he started!” Musk <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5125069-department-of-education-trump-musk-doge/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said in response</a> to <a data-id=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/03/trump-education-department-dismantling-executive-order-draft/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/03/trump-education-department-dismantling-executive-order-draft/\">a report from The Washington Post</a> about Trump’s potential executive actions and DOGE going through data from the federal agency. </p>\n\n<p>“Not this time. President @realDonaldTrump will succeed,” he added.  </p>\n<p>Eliminating the department would require legislative action, as some of the programs are written into law, but there are significant ways the president could weaken it, such as abolishing others, cutting down personnel, investigating programs, shifting funding or moving programs to other federal departments.  </p>\n<p>“He can’t really do a whole lot. You can’t eliminate Title I. He can’t eliminate the [Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]. There are lots of other things that he can’t just stop,” said Neil McCluskey, director for the Center for Educational Freedom at CATO Institute.        </p>\n\n<p>“I think that it’s probably within his executive power: not to eliminate the programs, but to examine them and see how they work and whether or not they’re working properly. And I imagine that will be part of the executive order,” McCluskey added. </p>\n<p>When asked about potential executive action, a White House official told The Hill that Trump “plans to fulfill a campaign promise by revaluating the future of the Department of Education.” </p>\n<p>On Friday, DOE sent letters to dozens of staffers putting them on administrative leave due to executive action Trump signed to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs from the federal government.  </p>\n\n<p>The union for the staffers said many of the targeted employees had no direct involvement in DEI but attended a DEI program back in 2019 during Trump’s first term in office that was encouraged by his then-secretary of education.  </p>\n<p>“President Trump was elected to bring about unprecedented reform to the federal civil service to ensure it is merit-based and efficient at serving the interests of the American people. At the Department of Education, we are evaluating staffing in line with the commitment to prioritizing meaningful learning ahead of divisive ideology in schools and putting student outcomes above special interests,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Communications Madi Biedermann when asked for comment about the potential executive actions by the president and placing staff on administrative leave.  </p>\n<p>Eliminating the department altogether is an idea that certainly does have its defenders on Capitol Hill.</p>\n\n<p>“To my friends who are upset, I would say with respect, call somebody who cares. You better get used to this. It’s USAID today, it’s going to be the Department of Education tomorrow,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said on Fox News this week.</p>\n<p>Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) reintroduced a bill this month in the House to eliminate DOE. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) introduced a bill with the same goal in the Senate back in November. </p>\n<p>But such a measure would have to not only clear the House, where Republicans have a razor-thin majority, also secure 60 votes in the Senate to beat a filibuster.

A hold on arms sales to Israel signals a major flouting of convention, where U.S. military support for Israel is viewed as an investment in American national security.   </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/u-s-readies-new-1-billion-arms-sale-to-israel-6832aa26\">Wall Street Journal reported</a> that the $1 billion arms sale package for Israel includes 4,700 1,000-pound bombs, worth more than $700 million, as well as armored bulldozers built by Caterpillar, worth more than $300 million, citing U.S. officials. </p>\n<p>The hold comes as Democrats <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5119639-democrats-frustration-trump-agenda/\">have seethed</a> over Trump’s actions a little over two weeks into his presidency. They pushed back on an initial federal aid freeze; are <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5116538-senate-democrats-oppose-trump-agenda/\">condemning a halt</a> on U.S. foreign assistance; <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5123663-democrats-blocked-entry-usaid/\">raising alarm</a> over the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID); and opposing the president’s threats of tariffs on America’s neighbors Mexico and Canada, to name a few of the high profile conflicts. </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>But there’s few options for Democrats to push back on Trump’s agenda absent Republican allies given the GOP’s slim majorities in the House and Senate. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5123870-schatz-trump-state-department-hold-usaid/\">have announced</a> they will delay and stall Trump’s State Department nominees until the administration retreats on its efforts to break up USAID. </p>\n<p>Trump could try and override the Israeli arms sale hold. In 2019, Trump issued an emergency declaration to push through more than $8 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan without congressional approval. The Republican-controlled Senate at the time <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/saudi-arabia-arms-deal-trump-what-to-know/\">voted to block</a> the arms sale. </p>\n\n<p>Arms sales to Israel are historically bipartisan, even as Democrats have increasingly raised alarm over Israel’s war conduct in the Gaza Strip and Netanyahu’s policies toward Palestinians. </p>\n<p>Amid Israel’s war against Hamas in response to the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack, an estimated half of the nearly 47,000 Palestinian casualties are women, children and the elderly. Nearly all of the two million Gaza residents require humanitarian assistance and 90 percent are displaced among widespread destruction. </p>\n<p>Still, Democrats in positions of power did not stand in the way of President Biden sending weapons to Israel or green-lighting arms sales. In June, Biden <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4727080-top-democrats-gregory-meeks-ben-cardin-israel-hamas-war-massive-weapons-package/\">moved forward</a> on a $18 billion arms sale to Israel. </p>\n<p>Netanyahu will meet with Trump at the White House on Tuesday and is expected to visit Capitol Hill and meet with lawmakers on Wednesday. </p>\n<p>The U.S. provides about $38 billion to Israel as part of a 10-year memorandum of understanding (MOU). That amounts to $3.3 billion in foreign military financing — generally a credit for Israel to purchase weapons systems in the U.S. and $500 million for missile defense programs annually. The MOU runs through fiscal year 2028 and will need to be renewed in 2029. </p>\n</div>",

It is suing the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).</p>\n\n<p>Public Citizen Litigation Group is representing the organization.</p>\n<p>After President Trump signed an executive order stating that the U.S. will only <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5097278-trump-executive-order-gender-transition/\">recognize two sexes</a>, federal health agencies began scrubbing their websites of materials which the executive order said “promote gender ideology.” </p>\n<p>This led to some websites erroneously being taken down as federal employees scrambled to comply with the order, with several web pages focusing on HIV/AIDS temporarily being taken down.</p>\n<p>The complaint states, “The removal of the webpages and datasets creates a dangerous gap in the scientific data available to monitor and respond to disease outbreaks, deprives physicians of resources that guide clinical practice, and takes away key resources for communicating and engaging with patients.”</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>The suit cited several key websites that have been taken down since Trump’s “gender ideology” executive order was issued, including the Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance System, the data and statistics webpage for Adolescent and School Health and the webpages for the Social Vulnerability Index.</p>\n<p>“These federal agencies exist to serve the American people by protecting public health,” said Zach Shelley, Public Citizen Litigation Group attorney and lead counsel on the case. “Removing this vital information flouts that mandate. Our lawsuit seeks to hold them to their responsibilities to the people of this country.”</p>\n\n<p>Several websites that provide guidance on prescribing PrEP for HIV and monitoring for the disease were further cited as key resources that U.S. physicians look to that have been taken down.</p>\n<p>“Like many of my colleagues, I am both a doctor who takes care of patients and a researcher. Removing critical clinical information and datasets from the websites of CDC, FDA, and HHS not only puts the health of our patients at risk, but also endangers research that improves the health and health care of the American public,” said Reshma Ramachandran, a member of the Doctors for America board of directors.</p>\n<p>Doctors for America is alleging three counts against OPM, the CDC, HHS and the FDA. It alleges OPM’s actions have exceeded its legal authority; that both the CDC and HHS have violated the Paperwork Reduction Act and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA); and that the FDA also violated the APA.</p>\n<p>The group is asking that a federal judge declare the agencies’ actions to be unlawful and that the agencies restore the webpages and datasets which have been taken down.</p>\n<p>The Hill has reached out to the federal agencies named in the lawsuit for comment.</p>\n</div>",
