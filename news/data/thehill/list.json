Trump <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5119696-trump-tariffs-oil-semiconductors/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">conceded</a> that these tariffs could cause “some temporary, short-term disruption” but that “people will understand that.”</p>\n<p>This is wishful thinking. The harm caused by these tariffs will not be “temporary” or “short-term,” and a <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/poll-63-americans-want-increase-trade-other-nations-75-worry-tariffs-are-raising-consumer\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recent poll</a> shows that even voters who support tariffs are not willing to pay for them.  </p>\n\n<p>Of all the Trump tariffs, the one on copper may be the hardest to square with his narrative. </p>\n<p>The U.S., like the rest of the world, has an insatiable appetite for copper. This critical mineral is key to cutting-edge technologies, such as the <a href=\"https://www.ectp.com/2024/05/are-we-beginning-a-new-age-of-copper/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hardware and data centers</a> that AI increasingly demands. Not surprisingly, global demand for copper is <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/horizons/securing-copper-supply-china-energy-transition/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">expected</a> to surge by 75 percent by 2050.</p>\n<p>Trump is right to target copper as a national priority, but he’s going about it the wrong way. </p>\n<p>As he made clear on the campaign trail, Trump believes that tariffs can lead to a renaissance in U.S. manufacturing. His bet is that to get around a steep tariff wall, foreign and domestic investors will do business in America, rather than export from abroad. It won’t work, especially not for copper. </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Like semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, copper is the product of a complex supply chain. The <a href=\"https://miningdigital.com/supply-chain-management/bypassing-china-in-copper-supply-chain-will-cost-85bn\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">four key stages</a> include mining, smelting and refining, semi-fabricating and manufacturing final goods. The U.S. has different challenges at each stage, but tariffs are not the solution to any of them. </p>\n<p>First, there’s the problem of bringing a mine online. According to an <a href=\"https://press.spglobal.com/2024-07-18-United-States-Ranks-Next-to-Last-in-Development-Time-for-New-Mines-that-Produce-Critical-Minerals-for-Energy-Transition,-S-P-Global-Finds\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P Global report</a>, the U.S. ranks second last internationally in terms of required lead times (29 years), just ahead of Zambia (34 years). Permitting obstacles, particularly on federal land, and the high risk of litigation once the mine is up and running, set the U.S. apart from other countries.  </p>\n\n<p>These factors keep investors at bay, even though America’s endowment of copper is comparable to Canada’s and Australia’s combined. </p>\n<p>The Interior Department’s <a href=\"https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Geological Survey</a> notes that 17 of America’s 25 copper mines account for 99 percent of domestic output. Some of these mines aren’t at capacity and others have been <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/trumps-copper-aluminium-tariffs-may-raise-costs-us-consumers-2025-01-28/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">shuttered</a>.  </p>\n<p>New infrastructure and power contracts would help in this regard, not tariffs. Yet, more capacity would lay bare other problems for which the answer is free trade, not protectionism. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Second, the U.S. is <a href=\"https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">home</a> to just two primary smelters, one secondary smelter, and 17 refineries. As a <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/horizons/securing-copper-supply-china-energy-transition/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">study by Wood Mackenzie</a> points out, these are the sectors in which America is absent and unlikely to catch up.</p>\n<p>The study observes that there are no plans for smelters in North America or Europe — one in Georgia is slated to focus on scrap copper — and concludes that fully decoupling from China in these downstream activities “is unfeasible.” Indeed, China currently <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/horizons/securing-copper-supply-china-energy-transition/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">controls</a> 97 percent of global smelting and refining capacity. </p>\n<p>U.S. copper imports have <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danikenson/2025/01/29/copper-tariffs-would-short-circuit-an-already-challenging-us-electrification-build-out/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">risen</a> from 10 percent of demand in 1995 to 50 percent today and are expected to increase to two-thirds by 2035. <a href=\"https://www.mining.com/web/copper-price-rises-in-us-and-slips-in-london-after-trump-tariff-threat/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Half of these imports</a> come from Canada, which would face the brunt of Trump’s tariffs, since other major exporters, like Chile, mainly sell to China. So this will hurt the U.S. </p>\n\n<p>American business needs refined copper. Some 65,000 American workers, who tally for $77 billion in economic output, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danikenson/2025/01/29/copper-tariffs-would-short-circuit-an-already-challenging-us-electrification-build-out/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">depend on Canadian imports</a>. Just like in autos, the two countries share an integrated copper supply chain. Tariffs will only compound America’s home-grown mining woes. </p>\n<p>In his press conference, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jg10t8KaCME\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Trump hinted</a> that copper tariffs might not be rolled out with those on steel and aluminum, suggesting he wants more time to better calibrate them. It’s a fool’s errand.  </p>\n<p>The tariff rate that would be required to compensate for U.S. regulatory uncertainty and the risk of litigation would slow global growth and spur inflation in the U.S. In light of this, Trump’s proposed copper tariffs will put America last, not first. </p>\n\n<p><em>Marc L.

This court will not be the first.” </p>\n<p>A separate federal judge in Seattle <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5102977-trump-birthright-citizenship-blocked/\">previously put Trump’s executive order on hold</a>.

We think it is consistent with the rule that we have laid out for the Citizenship Clause,” Hamilton said. </p>\n\n<p>But Boardman rejected that notion and said a ruling blocking Trump’s order nationwide was necessary to protect the public interest. </p>\n<p>“Today, virtually every baby born on U.S. soil is a citizen upon birth. That is the law and tradition of our country. That law and tradition will remain the status quo pending the resolution of this case,” said Boardman, an appointee of former President Biden. </p>\n<p>“The government will not be harmed by a preliminary injunction that prevents it from enforcing an executive order likely to be found unconstitutional,” she added. </p>\n<p><em>DEVELOPING</em></p>\n</div>",

Approximately <a href=\"https://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/gaza-strip\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">two-thirds</a> of all Palestinians in Gaza are refugees whose families were driven from their homes or who fled in fear for their lives in advance of the approaching Israeli military during and after Israel’s establishment in 1948. Despite a <a href=\"https://www.unrwa.org/content/resolution-194\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">United Nations resolution</a> passed in December 1948 calling for Palestinian refugees to be allowed to return home, Israel has denied them this right, anchored in international law, for more than 75 years.</p>\n<p>Palestinians refer to their national dispossession by Israel as the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/unispal/about-the-nakba/#:~:text=The%20Nakba%2C%20which%20means%20%E2%80%9Ccatastrophe,ethnic%20and%20multi%2Dcultural%20society.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nakba</a> — “catastrophe” in English. Rather than Trump and Netanyahu inflicting another Nakba, Palestinians should be allowed not only to rebuild their homes in Gaza, but to return to the homes from which Israel expelled them in 1948. </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Trump also issued an <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5126581-trump-withdraws-from-un/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">executive order</a> yesterday permanently defunding UNRWA, the international agency tasked with providing health care, education and food to Palestinian refugees since 1949. UNRWA is the only service provider with the infrastructure in Gaza to address the overwhelming needs faced by Palestinians who survived Israel’s <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/12/18/israel-starvation-used-weapon-war-gaza\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">persecution and starvation</a>. Defunding UNRWA will undoubtedly exacerbate the humanitarian crisis there.       </p>\n<p>In advance of Netanyahu’s visit, Trump had laid the groundwork for Israel expelling Palestinians from Gaza by supplying it with <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5126369-congress-israel-arms-sale-hold/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$1 billion in additional weapons</a>, including $700 million in 1,000-pound bombs and $300 million of armored bulldozers, a prospect which is currently being blocked by Democrats in Congress.</p>\n\n<p>Trump also lifted the Biden administration’s hold on deliveries of <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/01/25/trump-israel-bomb-shipment-hold-gaza\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2,000-pound bombs</a> to Israel, reportedly delivering 1,800 of these devastating behemoths in a matter of days. This bomb was the only weapon the Biden administration (belatedly) denied Israel during its 15 months of genocidal violence, only after shipping more than <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us-has-sent-israel-thousands-2000-pound-bombs-since-oct-7-2024-06-28/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">10,000 of these bombs</a> to Israel as of June 2024.  </p>\n<p>Israel repeatedly used these bombs to inflict atrocities against Palestinians in Gaza. To take but one example of many, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/world/middleeast/israel-bomb-jabaliya.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times</a> found that Israel killed dozens of civilians and injured hundreds when it dropped two 2,000-pound bombs on a densely populated area of Jabalia in October 2023. Trump’s unblocking of these weapons signals an even greater permissiveness than Biden showed in enabling Israel to attack Palestinians with this weapon, whose use in civilian areas is both indiscriminate and disproportionate, furthering U.S. complicity in potential future war crimes.</p>\n<p>In addition, on Inauguration Day, Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rescinded</a> the Biden administration’s Executive Order 14115, which sanctioned violent Israeli settlers and settlement organizations responsible for driving Palestinians off their land. Although the Biden administration failed to sanction Israeli governmental ministers and members of the Israeli military responsible for Israel’s colonization and theft of Palestinian land, the sanctions against individuals and entities nevertheless was the only tangible step taken by the U.S. to hold accountable Israelis for their violations of international law. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Extremist Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich <a href=\"https://x.com/bezalelsm/status/1881589749464392112\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">praised Trump’s revocation</a> of the sanctions, an act which he interpreted as giving Israel a free hand to “expand settlement,” perhaps as a prelude to Israel’s formal annexation of the West Bank.  </p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, previously sanctioned Israeli settlers and settler organizations will also view Trump’s recission of sanctions as a green light to continue violently driving Palestinians away. In 2024, <a href=\"https://www.unocha.org/publications/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/humanitarian-situation-update-252-west-bank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to the United Nations</a>, settler attacks against Palestinians spiked to their highest level ever recorded, displacing approximately 4,250 Palestinians from their homes.</p>\n<p>Providing Israel a freer hand in the West Bank also raises the specter of Israel replicating there the violence it inflicted on Palestinians in Gaza. After Trump revoked sanctions on settlers, the Israeli army invaded the West Bank city of Jenin, killing at least 10 people, including two-year-old <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/26/israeli-forces-kill-2-year-old-palestinian-girl-in-occupied-west-bank-raid\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Laila al-Khatib</a>. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz ominously <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-army-gaza-west-bank-offensive-hamas-jenin-palestinian-authority-rcna188904\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">stated</a> that the attack on Jenin incorporated lessons learned from Israel’s genocidal campaign in Gaza.  </p>\n\n<p>Reportedly, it was only due to the pressure exerted by the incoming Trump administration — and in particular by its special envoy for Middle East Peace, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/18/the-inside-story-of-how-an-unlikely-alliance-of-trump-and-biden-led-to-historic-gaza-ceasefire-deal\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Witkoff</a> — that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu felt compelled to sign a ceasefire agreement. This is no small feat; Trump was able to accomplish what the outgoing Biden administration could not in 15 months. </p>\n<p>However, if the Trump administration deserves plaudits for its role in brokering a ceasefire agreement, policies adopted and statements made by the president since his inauguration undermine the possibility of solidifying the ceasefire and using it as a springboard to a political process to establish a just and lasting Palestinian-Israeli peace. </p>\n<p>If Trump is <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-saying-he-wants-to-be-peacemaker-and-unifier-trump-vows-to-rename-gulf-of-america\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sincere in his desire</a> that “My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker,” he must jettison these outlandish policies and statements. Peace will come only as a result of the Palestinian people being free from Israeli military rule and apartheid policies, and Palestinian refugees being allowed to return to the homes from which Israel exiled them more than 75 years ago.   </p>\n\n<p><em>Josh Ruebner, Ph.D., is an adjunct lecturer in justice and peace studies at Georgetown University and policy director of the Institute for Middle East Understanding Policy Project.</em> </p>\n</div>",

Gerry Connolly (D-Va.).</p>\n<p>In recent weeks the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) leader has sent staff to a suite of agencies, tapping into databases at the Office of Personnel Manage and the Treasury Department.</p>\n<p>Similar actions have taken place at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) where employees have been shut out of their email and told not to show up to the office.</p>\n<p>He was also the brainchild behind a new federal government program offering buyouts to federal employees – offering eight months of pay and benefits to entice workers to leave their jobs.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Musk’s status as a federal employee isn’t totally clear. He’s been classified as a “special government employee,” which usually limits employees to 130 days. </p>\n<p>It’s also unclear what authority DOGE employees have to access the databases.</p>\n\n<p>After Republicans killed the motion, Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) faulted Democrats for not inviting Musk as their witness for the hearing – an offer that would likely have been refused.</p>\n<p>“You all could have invited Mr. Musk to be your minority witness, but you all chose to have a college professor, which is what you normally choose to have as a witness at any hearing and that’s fine, but you all had an opportunity to ignite Elon Musk,” Comer said.</p>\n<p>Earlier in the hearing, Comer defended the work of DOGE, saying “real innovation isn’t clean and tidy.”</p>\n<p>“It’s what the American people voted for in November: a departure from the broken status quo,” he said.</p>\n</div>",

You think, “This is it — he’s finally going to blow himself up.” But, time and again, he walks away unscathed, grinning like the rules don’t apply to him.</p>\n\n<p>And, for Trump, they don’t.</p>\n<p>When he was running for president the first time, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-cheering-jersey-911/story?id=35355447\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">he told</a> George Stephanopoulos on ABC News that on 9/11, “there were people that were cheering on the other side of New Jersey, where you have large Arab populations. They were cheering as the World Trade Center came down. I know it might be not politically correct for you to talk about it, but there were people cheering as that building came down — as those buildings came down”</p>\n<p>Since there was absolutely no evidence to support what Trump was saying, I thought no one would take him seriously after that, that his fledgling political career would end before it really began. I was wrong.</p>\n<p>He mocked Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a man who endured torture as a prisoner of war, by saying he wasn’t a war hero because “he got captured.” I was convinced that a cheap shot like that would end Trump’s political aspirations. I was wrong again.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>He <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34930042\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">made fun of</a> a journalist with a disability. I thought he’d surely pay a price for that. He didn’t.</p>\n<p>He survived the “Access Hollywood” tape where he was heard saying “when you’re a star … you can do anything. … Grab ’em by the p—-. You can do anything.”</p>\n\n<p>One month later, he was elected president.</p>\n<p>Eight years after that, on his first day back in the White House, he pardoned or commuted sentences for more than 1,500 people convicted of crimes in connection with the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 — including some thugs who viciously attacked police that day.</p>\n<p>This certainly was a bridge too far, I figured. Even Republicans, especially the party’s leadership in Congress, wouldn’t stand for something that irresponsible. Wrong yet again.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Then, just when you figure the man can’t cross any more bright lines, without so much as a shred of evidence he linked diversity programs at the Federal Aviation Administration to the collision of a regional jet and an Army helicopter that claimed 67 lives.</p>\n<p>As the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/politics/trump-plane-crash-dei-faa-diversity.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">put it</a>, “President Trump’s remarks, suggesting that diversity in hiring and other Biden administration policies somehow caused the disaster, reflected his instinct to immediately frame major events through his political or ideological lens.”</p>\n<p>How many bright lines can Teflon Donald cross without paying a price? How many live grenades can he juggle before one blows up in his face? Can he say or do anything — absolutely anything — that would render him politically impotent? How can he not only survive all of it, but actually thrive?</p>\n\n<p>Let’s put it this way: It’s not only the MAGA faithful that are convinced we were heading in the wrong direction and that Trump could set things right. A lot of Americans were willing to put up with a certain amount of Trump-induced chaos to turn things around. (Whether he actually does turn things around is another matter. Stay tuned.)</p>\n<p>Trump didn’t create the anger and distrust running through America — he tapped into it. He saw that many Americans were tired of politicians who seemed more interested in “getting along” than fighting for them. Trump was a wrecking ball aimed at the establishment and, for a lot of people, that’s exactly what they wanted.</p>\n<p>His supporters think he’s one of them — except he’s a billionaire and they’re not, and he lives a luxurious life at Mar-a-Lago and they don’t. But he says what they wish they could say, does what they wish they could do, and sticks it to the people they resent: the media, the elites, the “politically correct.”</p>\n\n<p>Every time he crosses a line and gets away with it, they cheer because it’s like they’re getting away with it too.</p>\n<p>If they gave out gold medals for demolishing political norms, Trump would have a whole bunch hanging around his neck. If any other politician shattered so many political norms, he’d be greeting shoppers at Walmart — if he could even land the job.</p>\n<p>But for Donald Trump, crossing bright lines and juggling live grenades are just another day at the office.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://bernardgoldberg.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Bernard Goldberg</em></a><em> is an Emmy and an Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University award-winning writer and journalist.
