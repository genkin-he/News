Examples: a March 14 deadline in Congress to keep the government funded, pressure to collaborate with Democrats to lift the nation’s borrowing authority to avert default, expectations for new spending to help victims of natural disasters and the hurdles of nudging fractious House and Senate Republicans to coalesce around the specifics of lower taxes, less spending, higher revenues and less red ink this year.</p>\n<p>The president used his power to leverage some concessions from Canada and Mexico but allowed a 10 percent tariff on China, which he announced Saturday, to take effect today. The new levy, layered on top of tariffs from his first term, affects more than $400 billion of goods that Americans purchase from China each year.

According to public data, there are five sovereign wealth funds in the world with assets of more than $1 trillion. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund is believed to be close behind, at about $925 billion, and Trump seemed to set a target.   </p>\n<p><em>“I think in a short period of time, we’d have one of the biggest funds,”</em> Trump said. <em>“The Saudi Arabia fund is on the large side, but eventually we’ll catch it.”</em>  </p>\n<p>This has a ways to go, but keep this in mind as well: The U.S. is currently more than $36 trillion in debt, and Congress could have a say in whether this happens.</p>\n\n<p><em>Burman hosts “The Hill” weeknights, 6p/5c on NewsNation. </em></p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<p><strong>3 THINGS TO KNOW TODAY</strong>:</p>\n<p>▪ Our brains are filling with more and more microplastics, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/02/03/microplastics-human-brain-increase/\">a new study shows</a>.

USAID has for decades administered billions of dollars of humanitarian and development assistance around the world. </p>\n<p>The move comes after <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, under the auspices of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a White House working group tasked with “eliminating government waste” took aim at the agency. USAID offices were closed Monday and employees were told to work remotely. Dozens of senior officials have been furloughed and hundreds of contract employees laid off. Trump issued a 90-day freeze on nearly all foreign assistance, and while the State Department issued waivers for some lifesaving humanitarian aid, confusion over instructions disrupted aid agency operations.</p>\n<p>Sen. <strong>Andy Kim</strong> (D-N.J.), a former USAID employee, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5124128-usaid-worker-turned-lawmaker-this-is-no-way-to-govern/\">was among a chorus of Democrats</a> on Monday blasting the turmoil surrounding the agency.</p>\n<p><em>“You have mysterious people within this new administration sending out emails across the entirety of USAID telling them not to show up,”</em> Kim said Monday at the agency’s Washington headquarters. <em>“This is no way to govern, this is no way to treat public servants and this is no way for us to conduct our foreign policy as a country.”</em></p>\n<p>Senate Minority Leader <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong> (D-N.Y.) said late last week that any effort to dissolve USAID would be <em>“illegal and against our national interests.” </em>Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee are calling on Chair <strong>Brian Mast</strong> (R-Fla.) <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5124297-democrats-urges-usaid-hearing/\">to convene an urgent hearing</a> with senior Trump administration officials about USAID. Rep. <strong>Gregory Meeks</strong> (D-N.Y.), joined by Democratic members of the committee, urged Mast to convene a hearing with Rubio and <strong>Peter Marocco</strong>, director of foreign assistance, within the next two weeks, with lawmakers set to go on recess on Feb. 13. </p>\n<p>Lawmakers and legal experts are warning the Trump administration’s efforts to shutter USAID <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/foreign-aid/5123972-lawmakers-legal-experts-warn-shuttering-usaid-is-unconstitutional/\">are unconstitutional and are likely to face challenges</a> in court. Trump, meanwhile, dismissed the suggestion on Monday that it would require an act of Congress to do away with USAID.</p>\n<p><em>“I don’t think so. Not when it comes to fraud. If there’s fraud. Those people are lunatics. And, if it comes to fraud you wouldn’t have an act of Congress, and I’m not sure you would anyway,”</em> Trump said.</p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5122676-usaid-shutdown-elon-musk-doge/\">The Hill</a>: USAID appears to be first on the DOGE chopping block, despite being less than 1 percent of the federal budget.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent a letter to Treasury Secretary <strong>Scott Bessent</strong> on Monday demanding to know what access Musk was given to the federal payments system and what safeguards were implemented to protect Americans’ private data.</p>\n<p><strong>SHUTDOWN CHANCES RISE. </strong>House Minority Leader <strong>Hakeem Jeffries</strong> (D-N.Y.) said Monday that Democrats will use the coming battle over government funding as a vehicle to block Trump’s early efforts to gut federal programs — raising the chances of a shutdown in the middle of next month. In a letter to House Democrats, Jeffries <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5123216-jeffries-government-shutdown-trump-orders/\">hammered the administration for issuing a since-rescinded order</a> to freeze previously allocated federal aid. Jeffries suggested Democrats will oppose any federal spending bill that doesn’t explicitly prevent Trump from freezing, slashing or otherwise altering those programs.</p>\n<p>Jeffries’s warning arrives as Speaker <strong>Mike Johnson</strong> (R-La.) and GOP leaders are already struggling to unite their restive conference behind not only a government spending bill, but also a much larger package of tax cuts, immigration reforms and energy policies. Somewhere in that mix, they also need to raise the debt ceiling — an unpopular idea among many House conservatives.</p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/01/trump-administration-gathers-names-recent-hires-some-are-being-asked-justify-their-jobs/402631/?oref=ge-skybox-post\">Government Executive</a>: As the Trump administration gathers names of recent hires, some are being asked to justify their jobs.</p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5123461-trump-sovereign-wealth-fund-tiktok/\">The Hill</a>: Trump on Monday directed secretaries to begin a process to create an American sovereign wealth fund, suggesting it could partially own the popular app TikTok.</p>\n<p><strong>CFPB:</strong> Trump put Bessent, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/03/trump-cfpb-bessent-halt/\">a billionaire hedge fund manager</a>, in charge of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on an acting basis.

Can he shut down agencies duly created by Congress? Can he fire employees protected by civil service laws?

But a source told The Hill on Monday that the vote will not take place this week amid jockeying among Republicans over how deep the spending cuts should ultimately be.</p>\n\n<p>“There will not be a budget resolution markup this week,” the source said. “Leadership provided an ambitious timeline and the House is doing the best it can to meet that.”</p>\n<p>The decision to delay the markup comes after leadership presented lawmakers with a framework that proposed $500 billion in spending cuts, Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), a member of the House Budget Committee, told The Hill. The blueprint came after Johnson last week said he wanted that number to be a “floor” and not a “ceiling” to give committees flexibility when crafting the ultimate bill, which is subject to strict budget reconciliation rules.</p>\n<p>But Norman — who is also a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus — called that figure a “nonstarter,” and he said he is pushing for a bottom-line figure between $2 trillion and $5 trillion.</p>\n<p>“I’d like it higher because I just don’t have any confidence that if we set a floor of X billion, which doesn’t begin to solve our math problem,” Norman said. “I know $500 billion is a nonstarter, but whether we can get what amount as a level is, in my world it’s just got to be there.”</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>“It’s about the numbers now,” he later added. “And it’s about not having expectations so low that it doesn’t give incentive to really make a difference now that we’ve got a chance.”</p>\n<p>The early obstacle for the GOP’s sweeping legislation — which Republicans say will include an extension of tax cuts, border enforcement funding and energy priorities — is a concerning sign for Johnson as he looks to send the bill to Trump’s desk by Easter or Memorial Day, a timeline some Republicans admit will be difficult to achieve.</p>\n\n<p>One source blamed House GOP leadership for the hang-up, faulting top lawmakers for proposing a small figure when it came to spending cuts.</p>\n<p>“It is very clear that a single, big-bill budget resolution is not going to move this week,” the source said before news broke of the markup delay. “That is a direct consequence of the leadership putting forward literally deficit increases on the floor last week, and then bumping that number up to something south of $600 billion, which is demonstrably short of the cuts necessary to achieve at least deficit neutrality.”</p>\n<p>Republicans are looking to pass the Trump agenda measure through a process known as budget reconciliation, which will allow the GOP to circumvent Democratic opposition in the Senate.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Before crafting the actual bill, however, lawmakers must advance a budget resolution — which lays out the parameters of the legislation — through the Budget Committee, on which a host of hard-line conservatives sit and have the power to thwart any effort. Legislation needs majority support in the committee before heading to the House floor for a vote of the entire chamber.</p>\n<p>A number of Freedom Caucus members sit on the Budget Committee, including Norman and Reps. Ben Cline (R-Va.), Chip Roy (R-Texas), Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) and Josh Brecheen (R-Okla.).</p>\n<p>Cline told The Hill on Monday lawmakers are working to move the budget resolution “as soon as possible” but are acutely aware of the little room for error they have amid a razor-thin majority.</p>\n\n<p>The bloc of hard-liners on the Budget Committee has enough power in numbers to block the resolution from advancing. And if the resolution does eventually hit the House floor, Republicans will have little — maybe even zero — room for error. When Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) departs the House to serve as the Trump administration’s ambassador to the U.N., which is expected to happen soon, Republicans will not be able to afford any defections on party-line measures.</p>\n<p>“We want to ensure that we’re all united behind the product,” Cline told The Hill, “and with our margin as thin as we have, we gotta measure twice and cut once, as we say.”</p>\n<p>The debate about how much to slash federal spending to offset Trump’s priorities on border, tax and other ideas is partly why the Freedom Caucus has been calling to split the reconciliation bill into two parts. That strategy would allow Republicans to quickly deliver on some of Trump’s border priorities while they figure out the trickier tax portion later in the year. But those who favor the one-bill track see risks in isolating the tax portion of the agenda and leaving it until later. </p>\n\n<p>Johnson, for his part, acknowledged concerns about the cost of Trump’s legislative priorities on “Fox &amp; Friends” on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSHw7d_PLxM\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Monday morning</a>, saying that Republicans are searching for savings to offset the price tag on the cuts. </p>\n<p>“We don’t want to blow a hole in the deficit by extending the Trump-era tax cuts, for example,” Johnson said. “But we’re definitely going to get that extended. So we’ve got to find those savings.”</p>\n<p>Jonson talked about actions outside the bill that could count as “savings” — such as income from new tariffs implemented by Trump and savings that result from changes made at the direction of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the Elon Musk-headed commission within the White House. </p>\n\n<p>“The tariffs are going to bring in revenue. We’re going to have massive savings by making government more efficient and effective,” Johnson said. </p>\n<p>But those kinds of external actions would not be counted as part of a traditional assessment of the budget resolution’s fiscal impact in a Congressional Budget Office score of the bill — and attempts by GOP leaders to count those extraneous moves as “savings” against the costly items in the budget resolution risk infuriating fiscal hawks who are looking for substantial cuts as part of the Trump agenda.</p>\n<p>Still, Johnson said during a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npMnkgW8SZ4\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fireside chat</a> with The Hill at the GOP retreat last week that he would like the reconciliation package to be deficit-neutral, and that he would prefer it to be deficit reducing.</p>\n\n<p>“That is a commitment we have. Why?” Johnson said. “Because the number one threat to our nation right now is our debt. It’s not China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea, it’s the debt, and we take that very seriously.”</p>\n</div>",

Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) criticized the Trump administration’s moves at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), saying it was an “egregious abuse of executive authority.”</p>\n<p>Dent joined CNN’s Jake Tapper on Monday, where he weighed in on the changes to the agency, which has essentially shut down in <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5124147-trump-musk-usaid-attacks/\">the last several days</a> by tech billionaire Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE).</p>\n\n<p>“Shuttering USAID is an egregious abuse of executive authority, full stop,” <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/former-gop-congressman-slams-egregious-abuse-by-trump-and-musk-beyond-anything-ive-ever-seen/\">Dent said.</a> “Elon Musk doesn’t have the authority to shut it down.”</p>\n<p>“By the way, his role, I thought, was advisory, to give the president advice. That’s fine, give him advice,” he continued. “But this is an operational role to shutdown USAID.”</p>\n<p>Dent argued that Congress has <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/foreign-aid/5123972-lawmakers-legal-experts-warn-shuttering-usaid-is-unconstitutional/\">already appropriated funds</a> for the international aid agency and that it is President Trump’s role to carry out that function.</p>\n<p>“When Congress passes a spending bill, an appropriations bill becomes law. That’s not a suggestion. They’re not giving advice to the president. It’s a command, they’re telling him how to spend the money now,” Dent said.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>He added that what has happened to the federal government over the last several days is “absolutely beyond” anything he’s ever seen.</p>\n<p>“We’re talking about a purge at the FBI, shuttering USAID, pardoning J6 criminals, launching a preemptive war against Canada and Mexico in the name of national security,” Dent said, later adding “this is outrageous.”</p>\n\n<p>The former lawmaker, who served in the House from 2005 to 2018, noted that there’s a role for Congress to play in combatting the flow of changes from Trump. The two chambers of Congress are not bystanders, Dent said.</p>\n<p>“March 14, the government must be funded. Republicans will need a lot of Democrats to help them pass a funding bill, and I suspect Democrats are going to make a lot of demands, like making sure that the monies that have been appropriated be sent as designated or as ordered by Congress,” he continued.</p>\n<p>Dent said he thinks GOP lawmakers are under a lot of stress amid the changes.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>“I’m just waiting for the dam to break,” he said. “I think a number of them are going to have to speak our forcefully on this rather soon.”</p>\n<p>While Dent didn’t hold back on his criticism of the USAID changes, many Republican lawmakers are backing Trump over the matter.</p>\n<p>Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho), the chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, noted that hard choices must be made to reduce the national debt. He said he was supportive of the administrations efforts to “restructure the agency” to better serve the country’s “national security interests.”</p>\n\n<p>Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-back-seat-trump-steamroll-congress-unilateral-moves-rcna190465\">told NBC News</a> that Democratic presidents have tried to “push the limits” of their power and he doesn’t “begrudge” the Trump administration for trying.</p>\n<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5123282-marco-rubio-usaid-take-over/\">took over as acting chief</a> of the agency earlier Monday.</p>\n</div>",

Thom Tillis (R-N.C.). “But you got to look at the reality that Mexico, it caught their attention and they’re sending troops [to the border.]”</p>\n<p>Tillis said Trump won this round with Canada and Mexico but warned that “sustained tariffs” would create a lot of economic damage.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>“I think sustained tariffs never work. There’s all sort of retaliation,” he warned. “At the end of the day, both sides suffer some damage through retaliation, closing markets, etc.”</p>\n<p>Many Republicans feel trapped between their traditional skepticism of tariffs and their desire to support Trump or at least avoid his wrath by sticking their necks out on the issue.</p>\n\n<p>Five and a half years ago, Senate Republicans discussed a resolution of disapproval when Trump vowed to apply a 5 percent tariff on Mexican goods during his first term.</p>\n<p>Now GOP lawmakers feel less confident about challenging Trump on trade policy, but they remain leery of becoming embroiled in a trade war with allies.</p>\n<p>Former Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) warned in an interview with “60 Minutes” that tariffs would drive up costs for average Americans.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>“It will drive the cost of everything up. In other words, it will be paid for by American consumers. I mean, why would you want to get into a fight with your allies over this?” McConnell warned.</p>\n<p>The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board on Friday called Trump’s proposed tariffs “the dumbest trade war in history.”</p>\n<p>The Journal warned that the tariffs would hurt the domestic automobile industry, which depends heavily on Canadian and Mexican suppliers, and “cause mayhem in the cross-border trade in farm goods.”</p>\n\n<p>Other Republican lawmakers declined to talk much about Trump’s high-stakes showdown with major trading partners, knowing he plans to threaten tariffs against European trading partners next.</p>\n<p>“Pause, we’re on pause,” said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), whose home state sends 30 percent of its exports, such as alcohol and tractors, to Canada, and another 20 percent to Mexico.</p>\n<p>When Republican lawmakers heard of Trump’s threat over the weekend to slap steep tariffs on nearly $1 trillion in imported goods and services, they hoped the president was maneuvering for negotiating leverage instead of digging in for a prolonged trade war.</p>\n\n<p>“The best tariffs are the ones never applied,” said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).</p>\n<p>“Using them as leverage to open discussion and try to convince countries to do something, they obviously have great value. It’s hard to argue with that. If they’re ever put in place, they’ll be a disaster for our economy. So I hope we don’t do that,” he said.</p>\n<p>Paul said Mexico has needed to put more of its army along the largely lawless U.S.-Mexico border for years.</p>\n\n<p>Other GOP lawmakers breathed a sigh of relief after Trump announced the pause, which immediately buoyed the stock markets.</p>\n<p>“Good news on Mexico tariff pause for 1 month,” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) posted on the social media site X. “Hopefully negotiating will preempt more talk of tariffs.”</p>\n<p>The Iowa senator had pleaded with Trump earlier in the day to exempt Canadian potash shipments from tariffs.</p>\n\n<p>“Biden inflation increase the input cost to farming by 20 percent [including] particularly high prices on fertilizer,” Grassley <a href=\"https://x.com/ChuckGrassley/status/1886408592477102422\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">posted on</a> the social platform X. “So I plead [with] President Trump to exempt potash from the tariff because family farmers get most of our potash from Canada.”</p>\n<p>Other GOP lawmakers said Trump’s tough approach worked, even if it gave them some heartburn over the weekend.</p>\n<p>“Looks like it worked,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said of Trump’s tariff threat.</p>\n\n<p>“I think that’s good that we got some cooperation from Mexico and didn’t have to use the high tariffs,” he said.</p>\n<p>But Cornyn, whose home state engaged with $272 billion in trade with Mexico in 2023, acknowledged no one knows what to expect after the 30-day pause expires.</p>\n<p>“If you knew that, you should pick a lottery ticket,” he said.</p>\n<p>Even before Trump and Trudeau reached their deal to pause tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods imported from Mexico, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) signaled he didn’t expect the tariffs to go into effect for any sustained period of time.</p>\n<p>“We’ll see how long” they last, Thune told reporters when asked for his reaction to Trump’s tariff threats Monday afternoon.</p>\n<p>“It sounds like the Mexican tariffs are already being paused,” he noted. “We’ll see what happens.”</p>\n</div>",
