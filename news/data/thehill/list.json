You think, “This is it — he’s finally going to blow himself up.” But, time and again, he walks away unscathed, grinning like the rules don’t apply to him.</p>\n\n<p>And, for Trump, they don’t.</p>\n<p>When he was running for president the first time, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-cheering-jersey-911/story?id=35355447\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">he told</a> George Stephanopoulos on ABC News that on 9/11, “there were people that were cheering on the other side of New Jersey, where you have large Arab populations. They were cheering as the World Trade Center came down. I know it might be not politically correct for you to talk about it, but there were people cheering as that building came down — as those buildings came down”</p>\n<p>Since there was absolutely no evidence to support what Trump was saying, I thought no one would take him seriously after that, that his fledgling political career would end before it really began. I was wrong.</p>\n<p>He mocked Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a man who endured torture as a prisoner of war, by saying he wasn’t a war hero because “he got captured.” I was convinced that a cheap shot like that would end Trump’s political aspirations. I was wrong again.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>He <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34930042\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">made fun of</a> a journalist with a disability. I thought he’d surely pay a price for that. He didn’t.</p>\n<p>He survived the “Access Hollywood” tape where he was heard saying “when you’re a star … you can do anything. … Grab ’em by the p—-. You can do anything.”</p>\n\n<p>One month later, he was elected president.</p>\n<p>Eight years after that, on his first day back in the White House, he pardoned or commuted sentences for more than 1,500 people convicted of crimes in connection with the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 — including some thugs who viciously attacked police that day.</p>\n<p>This certainly was a bridge too far, I figured. Even Republicans, especially the party’s leadership in Congress, wouldn’t stand for something that irresponsible. Wrong yet again.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Then, just when you figure the man can’t cross any more bright lines, without so much as a shred of evidence he linked diversity programs at the Federal Aviation Administration to the collision of a regional jet and an Army helicopter that claimed 67 lives.</p>\n<p>As the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/politics/trump-plane-crash-dei-faa-diversity.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">put it</a>, “President Trump’s remarks, suggesting that diversity in hiring and other Biden administration policies somehow caused the disaster, reflected his instinct to immediately frame major events through his political or ideological lens.”</p>\n<p>How many bright lines can Teflon Donald cross without paying a price? How many live grenades can he juggle before one blows up in his face? Can he say or do anything — absolutely anything — that would render him politically impotent? How can he not only survive all of it, but actually thrive?</p>\n\n<p>Let’s put it this way: It’s not only the MAGA faithful that are convinced we were heading in the wrong direction and that Trump could set things right. A lot of Americans were willing to put up with a certain amount of Trump-induced chaos to turn things around. (Whether he actually does turn things around is another matter. Stay tuned.)</p>\n<p>Trump didn’t create the anger and distrust running through America — he tapped into it. He saw that many Americans were tired of politicians who seemed more interested in “getting along” than fighting for them. Trump was a wrecking ball aimed at the establishment and, for a lot of people, that’s exactly what they wanted.</p>\n<p>His supporters think he’s one of them — except he’s a billionaire and they’re not, and he lives a luxurious life at Mar-a-Lago and they don’t. But he says what they wish they could say, does what they wish they could do, and sticks it to the people they resent: the media, the elites, the “politically correct.”</p>\n\n<p>Every time he crosses a line and gets away with it, they cheer because it’s like they’re getting away with it too.</p>\n<p>If they gave out gold medals for demolishing political norms, Trump would have a whole bunch hanging around his neck. If any other politician shattered so many political norms, he’d be greeting shoppers at Walmart — if he could even land the job.</p>\n<p>But for Donald Trump, crossing bright lines and juggling live grenades are just another day at the office.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://bernardgoldberg.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Bernard Goldberg</em></a><em> is an Emmy and an Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University award-winning writer and journalist.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) seems to have found common ground with President Trump and Republican lawmakers <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/business/5102823-trump-banks-discrimination-conservatives/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/business/5102823-trump-banks-discrimination-conservatives/\">over “debanking” concerns</a>, urging the president Tuesday to take action to prevent Americans from being improperly locked out of the financial system. </p>\n<p>The top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee called on Trump to support the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) efforts to combat debanking — the closure of bank accounts that financial institutions consider risky, often with little or no notice.    </p>\n\n<p>“I write to request that you take action on preventing the debanking of too many Americans across the country, including consumers unfairly locked out of the financial system due to overdraft fees, religious affiliation, or political beliefs,” Warren wrote in a letter to Trump. </p>\n<p>“Your Administration can help to address this problem by supporting the ongoing efforts of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the main agency in our government working to stop unfair debanking, and directing other agencies to use their authorities to bring an end to this practice,” she added. </p>\n<p>Her call to support the CFPB comes after Trump tapped Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to serve as acting director of the agency Monday. Bessent reportedly halted staff to halt all work, according to The Wall Street Journal. </p>\n<p>GOP lawmakers have long opposed the CFPB, which they argue has overstepped its regulatory authority.  </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Warren argued Tuesday that Bessent’s order to halt work at the agency “will only impede efforts to stop debanking.” She pointed to several proposed or finalized rules from the CFPB that would bar debanking based on political or religious affiliation and provide debanked customers notice and the ability to appeal account closures. </p>\n<p>The Massachusetts Democrat said her staff has identified thousands debanking-related complaints in the past three years, with more than half of those complaints lodged against four major banks — Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup. </p>\n\n<p>The letter marks a rare moment of alignment between the progressive senator and Trump. The president took aim at debanking, and Bank of America in particular, during a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. </p>\n<p>During an exchange with Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, Trump accused his bank and other financial institutions of refusing to do business with conservatives. </p>\n<p>“I hope you start opening your bank to conservatives, because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America,” Trump said. </p>\n<p>GOP lawmakers quickly jumped on the bandwagon, with House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/business/5105371-crypto-debanking-investigation/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/business/5105371-crypto-debanking-investigation/\">opening an investigation</a> into debanking and Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott (R-S.C.) announcing a hearing on the topic. </p>\n</div>",

Tariffs against Mexico and Canada, which were set to be 25 percent, were <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5122864-trump-mexico-delay-tariffs/\">called off</a> after Trump spoke with leaders of both countries on Monday. </p>\n<p>Beijing responded <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5124874-china-united-states-retaliatory-tariffs/\">on Tuesday, retaliating</a> with its own set of sweeping tariffs impacting critical elements, including oil, coal and natural gas.

China’s e-commerce companies Temu and Shein could be affected by the tariff. </p>\n<p>The number of shipments coming to the U.S. that requested the de minimis exemption went up by over 600 percent, going from around 139 million a year in 2015 to more than 1.36 billion during the fiscal year 2024, according to CBP <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-proposes-new-rule-strengthen-enforcement-and-limit-duty\">data</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The de minimis value <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/de-minimis-value-increases-800\">increased</a> from $200 to $800 in late 2016 with the rise of e-commerce businesses and more low-value packages entering the country.</p>\n</div>",
