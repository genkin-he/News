Sens. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) and Peter Welch (D-Vt.) voted in support alongside every Republican. </p>\n\n<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) said in a floor speech on Tuesday that Turner is facing a “big job” at HUD, but believes he “has the grit, the determination, and passion to get it done.”</p>\n<p>“This is an important role. Our country is facing a housing crisis affecting big cities, rural areas, tribal lands – literally every part of our country. Higher construction costs and burdensome regulations have made homebuilding challenging. And what homes are on the market are too pricey for many Americans,” Thune said.</p>\n<p>“Many parts of the country have homelessness challenges. Too many distressed communities are struggling to turn their fortunes around,” Thune continued. “And despite a windfall of additional funding for HUD, these problems are, in many cases, getting worse.” </p>\n<p>Turner will now turn his attention to implementing plans atop a department with a $70 billion budget and 8,000 employees, including on housing costs and the U.S.’s homelessness crisis, which the ex-NFL player cited specifically during his confirmation hearing.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>“HUD is failing at its most basic mission, and that has to come to an end,” Turner said. “As a country, we’re not building enough housing. We need millions of homes, all kinds of homes: multifamily, single-family, duplex, condos, manufactur[ed] housing, you name it.”</p>\n<p>His confirmation marks the twelfth Trump nominee green-lighted by the Senate in less than three weeks. </p>\n\n<p>The chamber is also expected to confirm Russell Vought to lead the Office of Management and Budget on Thursday night. </p>\n</div>",

Gregory Meeks (N.Y.), the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said President Trump’s proposal for taking over Gaza “makes no sense.”</p>\n<p>Meeks joined CNN on Wednesday to discuss the idea floated by Trump while meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>“It doesn’t make any sense,” he said. “It’s again, the president just going off on his own.”</p>\n<p>Meeks noted that there are several countries like Egypt or Saudia Arabia near Gaza that had the option to take over the region, but did not do so. It would involve billions or trillions of dollars, “systematically remove people” from their homeland and would go against international norms, he said.</p>\n<p>“It just makes no sense,” Meeks reiterated. “It’s a violation of law, and it is inhumane.”</p>\n<p>Meeks told The Hill that he believes taking over Gaza would be colonization, but it’s an idea he doesn’t take seriously at all.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>“This guy just talks off the top of his head,” he said, adding, “It just doesn’t make any rational and common sense.”</p>\n<p>The New York Democrat said the human impact needs to be examined and there are many unanswered questions about Trump’s proposal.</p>\n\n<p>“What’s going to happen to all of those people? He just said all the … Palestinians have to leave. And then there’s [another] question about what happens to those people. Do they come back? Do they have the right of return?” Meeks questioned.</p>\n<p>The president’s remarks about Gaza on Tuesday were some of his most extreme comments on the topic, particularly as the nearly 2 million Palestinians hope to have their own state. Trump suggested the U.S. would develop the land, but didn’t provide details on who would be able to live on the land.</p>\n<p>Meeks said he believes Trump is attempting to cause chaos and move people’s minds away from things he is not doing.</p>\n<p>“He’s not reducing the cost of food. He’s not making life better for the American people. He’s not making homes more affordable for people, reducing the cost of rent. He’s not doing any of those things that are affecting everyday lives of Americans,” he said on CNN.  </p>\n<p><em>Mike Lillis contributed reporting. </em></p>\n</div>",

The other individuals, who’ve been reported in the press, do they have security clearance? Do you want that individual without a security clearance to have access to all that information.” </p>\n<p>Scott suggested that similar questions existed under the previous administration.</p>\n<p>“Under the Biden administration, we had no clue who was doing what most of the time,” he said.</p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"licenseKey\":\"bb199f70cb\",\"applicationID\":\"738543775\",\"transactionName\":\"MQNTMhdXDxECABBZDAhJchMWQg4PTBMLQxdIFl4VEQ==\",\"queueTime\":0,\"applicationTime\":2807,\"atts\":\"HURERF9NHE5BAkYKGBsb\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"agent\":\"\"}</script>\n</div>",

Trump <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5119696-trump-tariffs-oil-semiconductors/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">conceded</a> that these tariffs could cause “some temporary, short-term disruption” but that “people will understand that.”</p>\n<p>This is wishful thinking. The harm caused by these tariffs will not be “temporary” or “short-term,” and a <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/poll-63-americans-want-increase-trade-other-nations-75-worry-tariffs-are-raising-consumer\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recent poll</a> shows that even voters who support tariffs are not willing to pay for them.  </p>\n\n<p>Of all the Trump tariffs, the one on copper may be the hardest to square with his narrative. </p>\n<p>The U.S., like the rest of the world, has an insatiable appetite for copper. This critical mineral is key to cutting-edge technologies, such as the <a href=\"https://www.ectp.com/2024/05/are-we-beginning-a-new-age-of-copper/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hardware and data centers</a> that AI increasingly demands. Not surprisingly, global demand for copper is <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/horizons/securing-copper-supply-china-energy-transition/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">expected</a> to surge by 75 percent by 2050.</p>\n<p>Trump is right to target copper as a national priority, but he’s going about it the wrong way. </p>\n<p>As he made clear on the campaign trail, Trump believes that tariffs can lead to a renaissance in U.S. manufacturing. His bet is that to get around a steep tariff wall, foreign and domestic investors will do business in America, rather than export from abroad. It won’t work, especially not for copper. </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Like semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, copper is the product of a complex supply chain. The <a href=\"https://miningdigital.com/supply-chain-management/bypassing-china-in-copper-supply-chain-will-cost-85bn\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">four key stages</a> include mining, smelting and refining, semi-fabricating and manufacturing final goods. The U.S. has different challenges at each stage, but tariffs are not the solution to any of them. </p>\n<p>First, there’s the problem of bringing a mine online. According to an <a href=\"https://press.spglobal.com/2024-07-18-United-States-Ranks-Next-to-Last-in-Development-Time-for-New-Mines-that-Produce-Critical-Minerals-for-Energy-Transition,-S-P-Global-Finds\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P Global report</a>, the U.S. ranks second last internationally in terms of required lead times (29 years), just ahead of Zambia (34 years). Permitting obstacles, particularly on federal land, and the high risk of litigation once the mine is up and running, set the U.S. apart from other countries.  </p>\n\n<p>These factors keep investors at bay, even though America’s endowment of copper is comparable to Canada’s and Australia’s combined. </p>\n<p>The Interior Department’s <a href=\"https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Geological Survey</a> notes that 17 of America’s 25 copper mines account for 99 percent of domestic output. Some of these mines aren’t at capacity and others have been <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/trumps-copper-aluminium-tariffs-may-raise-costs-us-consumers-2025-01-28/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">shuttered</a>.  </p>\n<p>New infrastructure and power contracts would help in this regard, not tariffs. Yet, more capacity would lay bare other problems for which the answer is free trade, not protectionism. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Second, the U.S. is <a href=\"https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">home</a> to just two primary smelters, one secondary smelter, and 17 refineries. As a <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/horizons/securing-copper-supply-china-energy-transition/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">study by Wood Mackenzie</a> points out, these are the sectors in which America is absent and unlikely to catch up.</p>\n<p>The study observes that there are no plans for smelters in North America or Europe — one in Georgia is slated to focus on scrap copper — and concludes that fully decoupling from China in these downstream activities “is unfeasible.” Indeed, China currently <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/horizons/securing-copper-supply-china-energy-transition/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">controls</a> 97 percent of global smelting and refining capacity. </p>\n<p>U.S. copper imports have <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danikenson/2025/01/29/copper-tariffs-would-short-circuit-an-already-challenging-us-electrification-build-out/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">risen</a> from 10 percent of demand in 1995 to 50 percent today and are expected to increase to two-thirds by 2035. <a href=\"https://www.mining.com/web/copper-price-rises-in-us-and-slips-in-london-after-trump-tariff-threat/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Half of these imports</a> come from Canada, which would face the brunt of Trump’s tariffs, since other major exporters, like Chile, mainly sell to China. So this will hurt the U.S. </p>\n\n<p>American business needs refined copper. Some 65,000 American workers, who tally for $77 billion in economic output, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danikenson/2025/01/29/copper-tariffs-would-short-circuit-an-already-challenging-us-electrification-build-out/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">depend on Canadian imports</a>. Just like in autos, the two countries share an integrated copper supply chain. Tariffs will only compound America’s home-grown mining woes. </p>\n<p>In his press conference, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jg10t8KaCME\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Trump hinted</a> that copper tariffs might not be rolled out with those on steel and aluminum, suggesting he wants more time to better calibrate them. It’s a fool’s errand.  </p>\n<p>The tariff rate that would be required to compensate for U.S. regulatory uncertainty and the risk of litigation would slow global growth and spur inflation in the U.S. In light of this, Trump’s proposed copper tariffs will put America last, not first. </p>\n\n<p><em>Marc L.

They want peace in the Middle East,” Trump said on Tuesday during the press conference. </p>\n<p>“The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too — whether we’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site, and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out,” he <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5127021-trump-us-takeover-gaza/\">added</a>. </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Saudi Arabia rejected the potential permanent displacement of Palestinians, writing that Palestinians “will remain steadfast on their land and will not move from it,” adding the Kingdom’s position is non-negotiable and not “subject to compromises.” </p>\n<p>Saudi Arabia’s normalization with Israel is something the current administration is looking to move forward. The U.S. orchestrated the Abraham Accords during Trump’s first term in the White House, a deal that established normalized relations between Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Israel. </p>\n\n<p>“I think you’ll make that into an international, unbelievable place… I don’t want to be cute, I don’t want to be a wise guy, but the Riviera of the Middle East… this could be so magnificent,” Trump said. </p>\n<p>When he was asked about U.S. troop deployment, he said Washington will “do what is necessary.”</p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"licenseKey\":\"bb199f70cb\",\"applicationID\":\"738543775\",\"transactionName\":\"MQNTMhdXDxECABBZDAhJchMWQg4PTBMLQxdIFl4VEQ==\",\"queueTime\":0,\"applicationTime\":2115,\"atts\":\"HURERF9NHE5BAkYKGBsb\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"agent\":\"\"}</script>\n</div>",
