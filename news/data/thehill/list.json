Insurance as a share of mortgage payments has soared over the past 10 years, going from around 8 percent in 2013 to 20 percent in 2022, according to the report.</p>\n<p>This is expected to throw a wrench into decades of growth in the Sun Belt region in particular, where three states — Texas, Florida and California — have comprised nearly half of all natural disaster-related costs over the past four decades. </p>\n<p>The report projects that more than 55 million Americans will move to less climate-vulnerable regions of the country over the next 30 years, including 5.2 million this year. During the same 30-year period, the report projects that 70,026 neighborhoods nationwide will lose property value due to climate-related vulnerabilities, a net loss of $1.47 trillion.</p>\n<p>The heaviest spikes in insurance premiums will be largely concentrated in the Sun Belt, according to the report, with Miami highest at 322 percent, followed by Jacksonville, Fla., with 226 percent and Tampa, Fla., with 213 percent. New Orleans, with a spike of 196 percent, is the only major metropolitan area outside the Sun Belt in the top five for premium increases.</p>\n<p>Insurers in particular have been increasingly reactive to the risks of climate change such as more intense wildfires and climate change. Major home insurers have recently pulled out of California and Florida, the latter of which also has high rates of fraud and litigation. California <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5061625-california-insurers-regulations-high-risk-areas-coverage/\">enacted</a> a state regulation at the end of last year that will require insurers to offer coverage in wildfire-prone areas.</p>\n</div>",

This is precisely why President Trump’s <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/01/21/trump-drug-cartels-foreign-terrorist-organization-mexico-immigration-executive-order/\">decision to designate these cartels as foreign terrorist organizations</a> was not just necessary — it was long overdue.</p>\n\n<p>But the real question here is not why the U.S. designated these cartels as terrorists, but why Mexico has not. How can the Mexican government even pretend to claim sovereignty when up to <a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2021/04/28/former-us-ambassador-to-mexico-cartels-control-up-to-40-percent-of-mexican-territory/\">40 percent</a> of its territory is under cartel control?</p>\n<p>For years, Mexico has either turned a blind eye or been too weak to confront these monstrous syndicates, allowing them to terrorize both Mexicans and Americans. Meanwhile, Trump’s bold move has redefined U.S. policy, marking the first time in a generation that the U.S. has stood up to Mexico’s inaction on cartels.</p>\n<p>The foreign terrorist organization designation <a href=\"https://www.texaspolicy.com/arming-america-to-win-designating-the-mexican-cartels-as-foreign-terrorist-organizations-ftos/\">is a game-changer</a>, as it unlocks critical tools for U.S. law enforcement to combat these terrorists — seizing assets, charging material support to terrorism, and even deploying Special Forces if necessary. This wasn’t possible before, and it is outrageous that it took so long for anyone in power to act.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.texaspolicy.com/multimedia/article/the-hard-country-episode-26-trump-and-the-new-world\">others have argued</a>, Trump’s decisive action on cartels already makes his presidency one of the most consequential in a generation even if he accomplishes nothing else for the next four years.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Yet while the U.S. is fighting back, Mexico remains paralyzed. In a typical move of deflection that no longer surprises anyone, <a href=\"https://www.gob.mx/presidencia/prensa/siempre-voy-a-defender-a-mexico-por-encima-de-todo-presidenta-claudia-sheinbaum-sobre-ordenes-ejecutivas-firmadas-por-el-presidente-de-eua-donald-trump?idiom=es-MX\">Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum parroted empty slogans</a> about Mexico’s “sovereignty” and “independence” — but what sovereignty is left when cartels control up to 40 percent of your country’s territory?</p>\n<p>Mexico has spent years refusing to confront these cartels as the terrorist organizations they are — letting their citizens live in terror while longing for their government to act. A <a href=\"https://www.texaspolicy.com/press/results-from-tppfs-mexico-security-survey-highlight-growing-urgency-for-action-against-cartels-and-support-for-u-s-partnership\">recent survey by my organization</a> shows that 78 percent of Mexicans see their country’s security risks as unacceptable, yet Mexico’s government denies reality, playing the victim instead of stepping up.</p>\n\n<p>Why does Mexico refuse to call cartels what they are — terrorists? The answer is simple: money and corruption. Cartels are entrenched in every corner of Mexican society, from the streets to the halls of power.</p>\n<p>Andrés Manuel López-Obrador, Mexico’s last president, went so far as to admire drug lords, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-president-drug-cartels-violence-8f2c0ef01c2e4578c089d67adb02e447\">claiming they were more “respectful”</a> than white-collar criminals and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/31/mexico-president-peace-agreement-cartels\">proposing “social pacts”</a> with them.</p>\n<p>He also made it clear that Mexico would not tolerate any U.S. intervention in its fight against organized crime or drug traffickers. He frequently accused U.S. officials of overstepping, and in <a href=\"https://www.texaspolicy.com/amlo-sides-with-the-cartels/\">April 2023</a>, he boldly declared that he would use Mexico’s armed forces to protect trafficking cartels from U.S. action.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>His “<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-president-drug-cartels-violence-8f2c0ef01c2e4578c089d67adb02e447\">hugs, not bullets</a>” policy isn’t just weak — it’s a surrender to organized crime. How can the Mexican government claim to care about its people when it protects the very terrorists killing them? Why else would the government care so much about the fate of these drug traffickers unless it is colluding?</p>\n<p>Mexico’s refusal to label cartels as terrorists only highlights its political dysfunction and complicity. Trump deserves full credit for his decisive actions. It is time for Mexico to wake up and take responsibility. If it won’t, the U.S. will continue to do what Mexico refuses to — protect its own citizens and its borders.</p>\n<p>For too long, U.S. administrations have played nice with Mexico, afraid to upset the status quo. Under Trump, for the first time in a generation, there is accountability. The U.S. is defending its sovereignty — and Mexico is taken aback. </p>\n\n<p>It’s about time for Mexico to stop pretending that the cartels are anything but the terrorist organizations they are. If Mexico won’t do it, the U.S. will.</p>\n<p><em>Melissa Ford is a senior fellow for the Texas Public Policy Foundation’s Secure and Sovereign Texas campaign, which strives to keep our nation safe and free.</em></p>\n</div>",

Kennedy Jr.’s debunked theories around a link between autism and vaccines.</p>\n<p>“20 years ago, Autism in children was 1 in 10,000. NOW IT’S 1 in 34. WOW! Something’s really wrong. We need BOBBY!!! Thank You!

About 1 in 36 children now have a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), compared to about 1 in 150 in 2000.</p>\n<p>Trump has repeatedly <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5042497-trump-vaccines-autism-mandates-rfk-jr/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">drawn a false connection</a> between vaccines and autism rates— saying in December that he thinks there are “problems with vaccines”— and has suggested his administration, including Kennedy if confirmed, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5030325-trump-rfk-jr-debunked-vaccine-autism-link-conspiracy-theory-hhs-cdc/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">would investigate</a> a debunked link between the two. </p>\n<p>The Senate Finance Committee <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5123633-kennedy-nomination-advances/\">voted Tuesday morning</a> to advance Kennedy in a party-line vote, despite Democrats railing against his longtime promotion of vaccine misinformation.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) <a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/news/press-releases/leader-schumer-floor-remarks-on-president-trumps-erratic-and-unqualified-nominee-for-secretary-of-defense-pete-hegseth\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">called him</a> “one of the most erratic, unqualified, and unfit Cabinet nominees we have ever seen in modern times.” </p>\n<p>Hopefully, there will be someone in the Pentagon to push back against erratic defense policies that compromise our national security.</p>\n\n<p>But Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Kash Patel and Tulsi Gabbard, nominated to oversee public health, the FBI and national intelligence, are unqualified, unprincipled and untethered. This is really terrifying.</p>\n<p>Kennedy is Trump’s anti-vaccine nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services. In addition to administering the country’s Medicare and Medicaid programs, HHS has in its portfolio the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration. This is our center for scientific research and delivery of healthcare to all Americans.</p>\n<p>Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), appreciating that the general welfare is on the line, told Kennedy, “Frankly, you frighten people.” No wonder. One of those “people” might include his cousin Caroline Kennedy, who said she had known Bobby her whole life and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm29w09p7r4o\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">damned him in a letter to the Senate</a> as a “predator” lacking “any relevant government, financial, management, or medical experience.” She wrote, “His views on vaccines are dangerous and willfully misinformed.”</p>\n<p>Putting someone like Kennedy in charge of the nation’s health care establishment is recklessly dangerous. Americans could die without access to the latest scientific advances. Children could die without access to safe and effective vaccines.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Trump wants Kash Patel to head the FBI. Suffice it to say, J. Edgar Hoover, he is not. In his opening remarks, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) told Patel, “Public trust in the FBI is low. Only 41 percent of the American public thinks the FBI is doing a good job … Mr. Patel, it’ll be your job to restore the public’s trust and return the FBI to its core mission of fighting crime.”</p>\n<p>Some chance. Patel is all political vengeance. Before the committee, Patel lacked candor and credibility, straining to describe his past and accurately characterize his alleged accomplishments.</p>\n\n<p>Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) called Patel “a staunch Trump loyalist who has repeatedly peddled false conspiracy theories and threatened to go after President Trump’s enemies.” Patel switched positions, claiming he doesn’t have an “enemies list” — in fact, he published <a href=\"https://x.com/Timodc/status/1863620081873244259\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">such a list</a> as an appendix in a 2023 book — and that he wouldn’t launch revenge investigations. Patel may be saying the right thing now with his confirmation on the line, but that hardly restores “public trust in the FBI.”</p>\n<p>It’s not just Democrats who have deep reservations about Patel. Trump’s attorney general, Bill Barr, <a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/9e4ece3d-a9e9-492c-b56d-dae278f87667?j=eyJ1IjoiZnVuZHIifQ.EyGEkJ8j_xBCaMBtZFlmsSoVOAOKOvU_hXNZeAXvaTA\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rejected Patel</a> as a possible deputy director of the FBI, stating that Patel would be appointed over “my dead body.” That’s potent medicine coming from Trump’s “hatchet man,” who compromised the necessary independence of Justice Department. And when in his first administration Trump planned to name Patel deputy director of the CIA, Gina Haspel, the agency’s head, threatened to resign.</p>\n<p>Patel has a vengeful nature. When a reporter from The Atlantic <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/10/kash-patel-trump-national-security-council/679566/?utm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sought to interview</a> “many of the nearly forty” of Patel’s former colleagues, fearing certain retaliation, they said they would only do so if they could remain anonymous.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Durbin <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/dem/releases/durbin-delivers-opening-statement-in-senate-judiciary-committee-hearing-for-president-trumps-pick-to-be-fbi-director-kash-patel?utm_\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">summarized it</a> exceedingly well: “The American people deserve an FBI director focused on keeping our families safe from terrorism, drug trafficking and violent crime, not the checklist of grievances in this book. Mr. Patel, your record makes clear that you are not that person.”</p>\n<p>As for Tulsi Gabbard, even the editorial board of Rupert Murdoch’s <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/tulsi-gabbard-senate-intelligence-hearing-director-of-national-intelligence-section-702-478ef0e7?mod=trending_now_opn_3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street Journal doesn’t like her</a>.</p>\n<p>In a sizzling editorial, the Journal faulted Gabbard’s opposition to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which permits the government to monitor foreigners abroad without a warrant. The information goes into a database, around 60 percent of which goes into the president’s daily intelligence briefing. In some cases, the intelligence community can run inquiries on U.S. persons under strict guidelines imposed by Congress. This is not left-right issue. It is important national security stuff needed to combat terrorism that has overwhelming bipartisan support.</p>\n\n<p>Gabbard was woefully ignorant of the issues. “Warrants should generally be required before an agency undertakes a U.S. person query,” she told the Senate in writing, “except in exigent circumstances.” She underscored that view in response to a question from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Wisc.).</p>\n<p>Gabbard got turned around. Her argument was identical to that made by far-left Democrats, which Congress rejected. The Journal editorial board believes correctly that the time involved in getting a warrant requiring court approval would impede the government in monitoring terrorist threats in real time. While the agents and the lawyers are dithering, the clock is ticking on the time bomb, or the plane is being hijacked and jetting towards its target.</p>\n<p>Gabbard didn’t have a clue. When Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) asked her what she would tell a judge to establish probable cause for a warrant, she had no answer, lamely protesting that “this is the center of the debate.”</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n\n<p>All this — on top of Gabbard’s sanguine view of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and her links to Assad’s Syria — make her nomination a nonstarter.
