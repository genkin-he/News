Trump’s strategy of dismantling USAID amid a flurry of executive orders is almost certainly an <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/foreign-aid/5123972-lawmakers-legal-experts-warn-shuttering-usaid-is-unconstitutional/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">illegal exercise of powers </a>reserved for Congress.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t mean it won’t work. </p>\n\n<p>Trump’s first two weeks in office have been an unparalleled attack on the separation of executive and legislative power. Not only has Trump falsely claimed the power to <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-orders-temporary-funding-freeze-that-could-affect-trillions-of-dollars\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“freeze” spending</a> already appropriated by Congress — effectively a line item veto on steroids — his closure of USAID is a direct attack on congressional authority. Even so, good luck finding a <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/02/03/2025/usaids-breakup-sparks-little-outcry-from-even-pro-foreign-aid-republicans\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">single Capitol Hill Republican</a> willing to defend Congress’s equal status in this governing partnership. </p>\n<p>Trump’s latest threat, to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/03/trump-finalizing-plans-shutter-education-department-00202225\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">shutter the Department of Education,</a> is written in the language of a president convinced he stands above the constitutional order. Our congressional leaders must send a message to the White House by fiercely defending their legal authority to decide the future of USAID. As history has too often shown, powers seized by the White House are almost never given back to their original owners. </p>\n<p>Even in a political culture where truth evaporates at room temperature, the law is clear. Despite starting its life by executive order under President John F. Kennedy in 1961, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5124147-trump-musk-usaid-attacks/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Congress codified USAID</a> as an official independent agency in the 1998 Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act. Republicans may think USAID is one big liberal slush fund, but it’s clearly up to Congress — not the White House — to determine the scope of the agency.  </p>\n<p>The specific threat posed by Trump’s power grab is one our Founders knew well. The issue was clearly on their mind during the drafting of the Constitution in 1787, having just fought a bloody war to free themselves from an overbearing executive. In fact, concerns about a president seizing legislative powers — especially the power of the purse — <a href=\"https://csac.history.wisc.edu/document-collections/constitutional-debates/executive-branch/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dominated the media discourse of the day</a>. How little has changed.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>The scenes outside USAID headquarters this week may have lacked the drama of the Boston Massacre, but what was going on inside was equally revolutionary. It was there that Trump ally and megadonor Elon Musk directed officials to be locked out of their offices and refused entry to the building. “Spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper,” Musk would later <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5122676-usaid-shutdown-elon-musk-doge/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gloat on X.</a></p>\n<p>Nobody in Republican circles seemed concerned that Musk, who faces no form of congressional oversight, had been given unrestricted access to the Treasury Department’s <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/treasury-dept-elon-musks-team-access-federal-payment/story?id=118380399\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sensitive payment system</a> as a means to further choke off USAID funds. Nor did a single Republican lawmaker speak up when Musk voiced the extreme legal theory that Trump could <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/trump-elon-musk-deleting-government-agencies-usaid-1235254897/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dissolve any agency or department he wanted</a> without consulting Congress.  </p>\n\n<p>The framers of our Constitution wisely agreed that if the president had a problem with a law passed by Congress, he could persuade and cajole them to reform or repeal the law. It was, crucially, a transparent process meant to play out in full view of the public. Our founders both anticipated and explicitly took steps to prevent the type of unilateral action Trump just unleashed on USAID. Their only failing was expecting Congress to jealously guard its power instead of willingly surrendering it to the president. </p>\n<p>As is so common in Trumpian schemes, the end result is legal and organizational chaos. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday declared himself <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/politics/usaid-washington-workers/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">acting director of USAID</a> and announced a plan for the State Department to absorb whatever parts of USAID Musk doesn’t evaporate entirely. That must come with some bitterness for Rubio, who was once one of the Senate’s <a href=\"https://www.devex.com/news/us-sens-kaine-and-rubio-back-bill-to-diversify-usaid-funding-100491\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">leading USAID expansionists</a>.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the Senate’s weak-willed Republicans think the federal courts will bail them out by ordering injunctions on Trump’s orders. That would certainly spare lawmakers the unpleasantness of disagreeing with Trump in public. But the Supreme Court’s recent <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/supreme-court-grants-trump-broad-immunity-for-official-acts-placing-presidents-above-the-law\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rulings broadly expanding executive power</a> aren’t reassuring. The courts simply can’t be counted on to uphold the constitutional balance of power. Congress will need to do this heavy lifting itself. </p>\n<p>Trump’s indefensible power grab at USAID, and his similar plans for the Department of Education, should give all lawmakers cause to reflect on their oath of office and what it means to serve our Constitution and our country. More than ever before, the American people need and deserve a strong Congress to check and balance Trump’s increasingly authoritarian White House.</p>\n<p><em>Max Burns is a veteran Democratic strategist and founder of Third Degree Strategies.</em>  </p>\n</div>",

They’re some of Trump’s most extreme comments on the topic, as nearly 2 million Palestinians hope to have their own state. Trump suggested the U.S. would develop the land there but didn’t give details on who would be able to live on the land.</p>\n<p>Tlaib, in <a href=\"https://x.com/RashidaTlaib/status/1886974021041877232\">a separate post</a>, said Palestinians “aren’t going anywhere.”</p>\n<p>“This president can only spew this fanatical bull—- because of bipartisan support in Congress for funding genocide and ethnic cleansing,” Tlaib said. “It’s time for my two-state solution colleagues to speak up.”</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Additionally, Sen.

But his words could just as easily apply to President Trump, Elon Musk and the parade of Republicans who have unleashed so much chaos these last few weeks.</p>\n<p>If you’re watching <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5122521-musk-trump-agreed-usaid-should-be-shut-down/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Musk gut USAID</a> like it’s a Black Friday sale, or Trump going full Bond villain <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5114471-trump-milley-security-revoked/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on Gen. Mark Milley</a>, or <a href=\"https://x.com/JonahDispatch/status/1886552460111614191\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">appointing white supremacists</a> like he’s assembling an evil Justice League — I get it. I do. But don’t act surprised.</p>\n\n<p>Trump kicked off his 2024 campaign with the word “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/06/trumps-dark-i-am-your-retribution-pledge-how-gop-enabled-it/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">retribution</a>.” That was the pitch. Not unity, not hope, not even a catchy jingle — just straight-up vengeance.</p>\n<p>And guess what? He’s delivering. He said he was going to burn it all down, and now people are shocked there’s smoke?</p>\n<p>Amazingly, Trump (or, more precisely, his minions) literally wrote their whole playbook. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/31/politics/trump-policy-project-2025-executive-orders-invs/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CNN reported</a> that, of the 53 executive orders and actions Trump signed during his first week in office, 36 were straight out of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation document referenced frequently during the campaign.</p>\n<p>As a buddy of mine (not known for pulling punches) quipped, it’s like “Mein Kampf” meets an oil lobbyist’s PowerPoint. The playbook is set. And now, it’s merely execution time — figuratively, of course.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Say what you will about Trump, but he never tried to hide his agenda or his style. Yet, despite his utter transparency — not to mention that he already gave us a four-year sample of what he would be like as president — some people really do seem surprised. This is sort of like dating a stripper named Cashmere and then being stunned to learn that she is seeing other guys on the side.</p>\n<p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://x.com/ForecasterEnten/status/1886425365507141815\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to CNN’s Harry Enten,</a> just 1 to 2 percent of people surveyed think Trump should focus on tariffs, and more people were Googling “tariffs” than Taylor Swift.</p>\n\n<p>But why? During his campaign, Trump constantly talked about raising tariffs, saying it would do everything from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/us/politics/trump-michigan-town-hall-tariffs.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">revitalize the auto industry</a> to pay for childcare. “We are going to be taking in trillions of dollars. And as much as child care is talked about as being expensive, it is relatively speaking not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers we’ll be taking in,” <a href=\"https://wtop.com/business-finance/2024/09/trump-and-harris-lay-out-starkly-different-views-of-the-economy-starting-with-corporate-taxes/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">he said last September</a> at the Economic Club of New York.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the only surprise was that, after threatening to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico, he suddenly swerved and decided not to. Folks, <a href=\"https://x.com/scottlincicome/status/1861216180134125582\">that’s</a><a href=\"https://x.com/scottlincicome/status/1861216180134125582\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> the pattern</a> — the old bait and switch.</p>\n<p>But here’s what really gets me: It’s not just the clueless voters who didn’t see this coming. It’s the people who did see it coming, and are still flipping out every time he does something nuts. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>I get it — staying outraged keeps the resistance alive. But at some point, outrage starts to sound like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxnpY0owPkA\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Captain Renault in “Casablanca”</a>: “I’m shocked — shocked — to find that gambling is going on in this establishment!” Meanwhile, Trump is handing out chips to his supporters.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say everyone should go along with the craziness, or that we should just roll over and tune out so as to preserve our sanity. There may indeed be some calculated strategic benefit to “performative outrage.” If nothing else, maybe it will slow Trump down a bit. Or maybe it will position Trump’s rivals to capitalize if and when some exogenous event comes along and upends MAGA’s best-laid plans.</p>\n<p>My main point, however, is that whether you were ignorant, naive or utterly freaked out about the possibility of another four years of Trumpian madness, nothing that is happening right now should come as a surprise.</p>\n\n<p>If you were counting on “norms” and “institutions” to rein him in, you weren’t listening to the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-01-14/trump-inauguration-democracy-guardrails\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">many warnings</a> we gave you, explaining that Trump and his team would be better positioned in a second term to work around those norms and institutions.</p>\n<p>And if you thought sensible Republican politicians would somehow stop him, then you obviously weren’t paying attention to how Trump had systematically purged or tamed them all. Right now, they seem poised to rubber-stamp Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard into the Cabinet.</p>\n<p>We are now getting exactly what we voted for, exactly what we were promised and (presumably) exactly what we deserve.</p>\n\n<p>And if you’re wondering why I can so flippantly make light of things that are so shocking and new — to the degree that I was in mourning, it all happened on Election Day in November.</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>Everything after that?

And having watched much of the hearings about Robert Kennedy Jr.’s appointment, I’m more alarmed than I was before.</p>\n<p>RFK was <a href=\"https://www.city-journal.org/article/shake-up-hhs\">chosen to be a boat-rocker</a>. If one department is ripe for finding waste, fraud and abuse, it is HHS. It spends almost $2 trillion per year, and accounting for all of that money is nearly impossible. To take on a beast like this one, you have to be above-board with what you’re doing.</p>\n\n<p>Kennedy’s mission is to shrink; to eliminate the unnecessary and unneeded. It’s far too big a task for any one man. An effective secretary needs trustworthy staff and good judgment. And that judgment part is where I see problems for Kennedy. </p>\n<p>The arguments about his not being a doctor or an expert are empty political ploys that won’t really land. For one thing, the average person doesn’t know or care what a health policy expert is or knows. And the people to whom it matters won’t support RFK anyway, despite having backed the equally unqualified Xavier Becerra, the Biden HHS secretary who came into the job with no health care or public health background whatsoever, and then basically went missing after his confirmation.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t mean it will be smooth sailing for RFK. Democrats are desperate for at least one scalp, to show supporters they aren’t completely powerless. The list of possible scalps shrinks daily, as nominees outperform Democrats in their hearings and win over skeptical Republican Senators. RFK is one of the last bites at the apple they have left.</p>\n<p>Throughout these hearings, RFK has given a lot of ammunition to those who oppose his nomination. Instead of putting controversial positions and stances to rest, he’s exacerbated them. </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Which brings us to conflicts of interest. The thing about conflicts of interest is they don’t really have to exist in order to matter — they just have to appear to exist to have hay made out of them.</p>\n<p>Sometimes they do exist. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/08/02/joe-biden-investigation-hunter-brother-hedge-fund-money-2020-campaign-227407\">Joe Biden’s family presented an unending stream of conflicts</a>, as they made money from countries and industries they seemingly knew nothing about and then <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5095569-biden-family-pardons-oversight-committee/\">got open-ended pardons for their troubles</a>, just in case they did something illegal. Sometimes, the conflicts don’t exist, as when people pretended that foreign diplomats spending hundreds of dollars for a room at a Trump hotel would influence a presidential decisionmaking process. </p>\n\n<p>With RFK, it appears to be a lawsuit over vaccines. </p>\n<p>Gardasil is a vaccine against the human papillomavirus. Many people swear by it, and some countries claim it is <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/hpv-vaccination-world-can-eliminate-cervical-cancer\">responsible for the near-elimination of cervical cancer</a>. But nothing is universally loved, and RFK is a party to a lawsuit against its manufacturer. He stands to gain financially if the suit is successful. </p>\n<p>As HHS secretary, being party to such a lawsuit in an industry he will have influence over, he has at least the appearance of a conflict. That’s something even people who don’t pay attention can understand. Having an <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/29/warren-kennedy-hearing-vaccine-lawsuits-00201284\">argument with a senator</a> at your confirmation hearing doesn’t help. Nor does later changing your mind about the appearance of a conflict and removing yourself from the case in a way that only <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/31/congress/rfk-jr-to-revise-ethics-pledge-00201813\">confers upon your son</a> the financial stake you have in the case.  </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-less-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>RFK’s move in this regard only raises more eyebrows. In an effort to distance himself from the conflict, RFK just made it clearer that he or his family will continue to profit from suing a company he would regulate as HHS secretary — the ultimate “appearance of impropriety.” Rather than eliminate concerns, his actions have reinforced the worst preconceived notions of his potential conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>I’m no lawyer, but I do understand politics. The politics of this don’t look good. If your financial stake represents a probable conflict of interest, then you can’t solve the problem by just handing it off to someone in your family. </p>\n<p>I would like to see RFK rock the boat at HHS — he can tip it over for all I care. But he can’t do it effectively if he is hampered by conflicts of interest. If he doesn’t completely lose those conflicts, he may not get the chance to do anything. </p>\n\n<p><em>Derek Hunter is </em><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-derek-hunter-podcast/id1372929405\"><em>host of the Derek Hunter Podcast</em></a><em> and a former staffer for the late Sen.

Chesterton, described the utility of conservatives with tongue planted firmly in cheek: “The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of Conservatives is to prevent mistakes from being corrected. Even when the revolutionist might himself repent of his revolution, the traditionalist is already defending it as part of his tradition. Thus, we have two great types — the advanced person who rushes us into ruin, and the retrospective person who admires the ruins.” </p>\n<p>Progressives, Chesterton believed, are committed to change without always properly understanding its consequences. Conservatives are devoted to preserving the status quo without regard to its costs or benefits. </p>\n<p>Chesterton summarized the utility of conservatism more seriously in his paradox of the fence: “In the matter of reforming things…there is…a paradox. There exists…. let us say…a fence…The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, ‘I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.’ To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: ‘If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away…[W]hen you can…tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.” </p>\n<p>“The…fence did not grow there…Some person had some reason for thinking it would be a good thing for somebody. And until we know what the reason was, we really cannot judge whether the reason was reasonable…nobody has any business to destroy a social institution until he has really seen it as an historical institution. If he knows how it arose, and what purposes it was supposed to serve, he may really be able to say that they were bad purposes, that they have since become bad purposes, or that they are purposes which are no longer served.” </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>The aversion to change around which Chesterton constructed his parable and paradox were central to the fountainhead of American conservatism, another British thinker and politician, Edmund Burke, <a href=\"https://www.amphilsoc.org/blog/musings-manuscripts-reflecting-burkes-reflections\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">who argued</a>, “When ancient opinions and rules of life are taken away, the loss cannot possibly be estimated. From that moment, we have no compass to govern us, nor can we know distinctly to what port to steer.”  </p>\n<p>Donald Trump is not a conservative; quite the contrary, Trump is a radical revolutionary. He is not committed to Burke’s preservationist project but to overturning tradition and destroying institutions with no consideration of their history or utility.  </p>\n\n<p>Burke’s conservatism grew from his disgust at the excesses of the French Revolution. While the storming of the Bastille horrified Burke, Trump lauded the storming of the U.S. Capitol.  </p>\n<p>Nobody’s liberal, columnist <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/trump-and-the-collapse-of-the-old-order-policy-politics-eb2fe178\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Peggy Noonan underscored the reality</a>, “…the second rise of Donald Trump is a total break with the past — stable order, healthy expectations, the honoring of a certain old moderation, and strict adherence to…the law aren’t being ‘traduced’; they are ending.” </p>\n<p>In college I read a book titled “The Strange Death of Liberal England,” which argued that in the early 1900s, Britain’s parliamentary democracy was on the cusp of revolution and destruction, rescued only by World War I.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>“This is… a record,” its author wrote, “…not of great events but of little ones, which, working with the pointless industry of termites, slowly undermined England’s parliamentary structure until, but for the providential intervention of a world war, it would certainly have collapsed.” </p>\n<p>Whatever the truth about English history, the suicide of American conservatism is even stranger.  </p>\n<p>Republicans allowed a revolutionary to seize control of their party without the peaceful equivalent of firing a shot. Through myriad small events and actions, conservative leaders collaborated in their own demise and in the demolition of their own cherished philosophy.  </p>\n\n<p>To cite one example, in recent days former Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell gave public voice to his antipathy to Trump and his policies.   </p>\n<p>Yet, during Trump’s second impeachment, in the aftermath of Jan. 6, McConnell had it in his power to end Trump’s political career, to save conservatism from the dustbin of history, and refused, based on a patently absurd and historically unprecedented technicality.   </p>\n<p>Another small example: Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger did not have to be the only House Republicans to join the Jan. 6 committee.  </p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n\n<p>And so on. </p>\n<p>The Republican Party lives on, but its animating ideology for most of the last hundred years is strangely dead, at the hands of, or at least with the connivence of, its leading adherents.  </p>\n<p><em>Mellman is president of The Mellman Group a political consultancy. Mellman served as pollster to Senate Democratic leaders for over 20 years.
