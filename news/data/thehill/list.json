For adults over 60, the regions currently at risk for lethal heat waves are ten times higher: 20 percent of the earth’s surface.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>But if average temperatures rise to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels — or just another .5 degrees Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming — then the regions affected by lethal heat waves will spread until they have enclosed a total global area about the same size as the United States as a whole, the study found. </p>\n<p>Those impacts will be worst for parts of densely populated equatorial countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where billions of people could be at risk — even if planetary heating is kept at bay by significant shifts in how the world’s nations use energy and limits on the burning of fossil fuels, according to the study.</p>\n\n<p>If those shifts away from burning coal, oil and gas don’t happen, projections suggest that warming could exceed 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit). In that scenario, the study found, 40 percent  of the planet’s land area could feel the impacts of heat waves that adults can’t survive.</p>\n<p>In that scenario, Matthews said, only regions furthest from the equator — or at high elevation — would be unaffected. </p>\n<p>In all cases, he said, “as more of the planet experiences outdoor conditions too hot for our physiology, it will be essential that people have reliable access to cooler environments to shelter from the heat.”</p>\n<p>Such protections may require more than simply access to air conditioning. While air conditioning is nearly ubiquitous across the cities of the Southern U.S., these protections are vulnerable to disaster. During post-hurricane blackouts last July, millions of residents of Houston, Texas, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/newsletters/sustainability/4764637-houston-sweats-without-power-in-heat-wave/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sweated in the heat and dark</a> for more than a week — underscoring the overlapping dangers posed by a heating planet.</p>\n</div>",

In addition to Beijing, the president also imposed 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico over the weekend, although both countries reached agreements for a 30-day pause.  </p>\n<p>China responded Monday with a 15 percent tariff on liquefied natural gas and coal and a 10 percent tariff on crude oil, pickup trucks, agricultural machinery and large-displacement cars.  </p>\n<p>It also announced plans to impose export controls on several critical elements, including tellurium, bismuth, tungsten, indium and molybdenum.   </p>\n<p>“The US’s unilateral imposition of tariffs seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization,” China’s State Council Tariff Commission said. “It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems but also undermines the normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the US.”   </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>The tech industry is likely to be a key factor in the U.S.-China trade war. The U.S. had already placed strict export controls on advanced chips under the Biden administration in an effort to stymie Beijing’s artificial intelligence (AI) development.  </p>\n<p>The recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-business/ap-china-imposes-15-tariffs-on-coal-lng-in-response-to-trumps-tariffs/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-business/ap-china-imposes-15-tariffs-on-coal-lng-in-response-to-trumps-tariffs/\">raised questions</a> about the effectiveness of export controls and American firms’ approach to developing AI. </p>\n\n<p>DeepSeek claims its new R1 model can perform on par with OpenAI and was developed with just a couple thousand reduced-capacity chips for a final price tag of $5.6 million.  </p>\n<p>This threatened to upend the current consensus on AI development, which assumed that new models would require vast investment in AI infrastructure. American AI firms, like OpenAI, Meta and Microsoft, have committed billions of dollars to securing chips and building out data centers.</p>\n<p>After DeepSeek surged to the top of the Apple App Store last week, investors panicked, triggering a significant sell-off in the tech sector that saw chipmaker Nvidia lose $600 billion in a single day.  </p>\n<p>However, some have cast doubt on DeepSeek’s claims about its R1 model, including the total cost of training and whether more advanced chips were used. U.S. officials are reportedly investigating whether DeepSeek managed to circumvent American export controls to obtain advanced chips through Singapore, according to Bloomberg.</p>\n</div>",

Our efforts are fundamental in trying to attract the best possible talent into the National Football League both on and off the field,” he added during his state of the league address. </p>\n<p>President Trump has made it one of his priorities to remove DEI policies and efforts from the federal government. He signed an executive order to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5104168-trump-attacks-diversity-equity-inclusion/\">end such practices</a> shortly after assuming office. A variety of corporations, even before Trump took office, moved in a similar direction, ending DEI policies. </p>\n<p>In late January, Target <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/race-politics/5105514-target-dei-programs-trump/\">rolled back</a> its DEI policies and a program that emphasized offering products from Black- and minority-owned businesses. The program was created following the killing of George Floyd in 2020. Target joined the likes of Tractor Supply Co, McDonald’s and Walmart. </p>\n<p>Goodell referred to the Rooney Rule, which was introduced in 2003 and requires teams to interview at least one minority candidate for a head coaching gig, when emphasizing the NFL’s commitment to DEI. </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>“There’s no requirement to hire a particular individual on the basis of race or gender. It’s simply on the basis of looking at a canvas of candidates that reflect our communities, and to look at the kind of talent that exists there and then you make the best decision on who is hired,” Goodell said on Monday. </p>\n<p>“And so many of us, including the National Football League at our office, are doing that voluntarily at all levels because it has benefited us; and I hear that from companies on a global basis is that, that’s a very strong hiring practice that we are adopting also,” he added. </p>\n</div>",
