In September 2023, Congress confirmed her for a second term lasting five years. Before serving on the NLRB, Wilcox was a partner at Levy Ratner, P.C., a labor and employment law firm and associate general counsel of 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East. </p>\n<p>Trump fired Wilcox on his <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5098445-trump-executive-orders-first-day/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5098445-trump-executive-orders-first-day/\">first day in office</a>, which left the NLRB with just two members, meaning it doesn’t have a quorum to conduct its normal business.  </p>\n\n<p>Calling the president’s removal “unprecedented and illegal,” Wilcox’s attorneys noted their client was the first Black woman to serve on the board and is the first to be removed from office since its inception in 1935. Their lawsuit was filed in federal court in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>Federal law provides that the president can only remove NLRB members in cases of “neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, but for no other cause,” and they must also be given “notice and hearing.” </p>\n<p>“Under the NLRA’s plain language, Ms. Wilcox has a clear legal entitlement to retain her position as a member of the National Labor Relations Board,” Wilcox’s attorneys wrote. </p>\n<p>In addition to her firing, Trump also ousted NLRB general counsel Jennifer Abruzzo, effectively instituting a sweeping shift in the independent agency that enforces U.S. labor laws. The agency has been battling with large corporations, which have <a href=\"https://thehill.com/business/4491063-corporate-giants-aim-to-hobble-national-labor-relations-board/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">increasingly mounted legal efforts</a> seeking to dismantle the agency as unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>Trump’s firings are part of a blitz of sweeping actions he has taken during his <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5105634-trump-first-week-takeawys/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5105634-trump-first-week-takeawys/\">first few weeks in office</a> that are reshaping the federal government.

The invite comes just days after a recent phone call between the two leaders.</p>\n\n<p>The “productive call” touched on expanding U.S.-India cooperation on a number of global issues, which included security in the Indo-Pacific, the Middle East, and Europe. </p>\n<p>The phone call also saw Trump emphasize “the importance of India increasing its procurement of American-made security equipment and moving towards a fair bilateral trading relationship,” the White House said in a statement.</p>\n<p>“He is going to be coming to the White House, over next month, probably February. We have a very good relationship with India,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One in January.</p>\n<p>The confirmation of the visit follows news that a U.S. military plane with at least 100 migrants aboard landed in India on Wednesday.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>An Air Force C-17 plane landed at about 3:30 a.m. ET in Amritsar, India, according to the Defense Department.

India is set to host the Quad leaders’ summit in 2025.</p>\n<p>The Indian prime minister, who was reelected to a third term last year, but with greatly reduced power in parliament, has shared a warm relationship with Trump.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) seems to have found common ground with President Trump and Republican lawmakers <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/business/5102823-trump-banks-discrimination-conservatives/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/business/5102823-trump-banks-discrimination-conservatives/\">over “debanking” concerns</a>, urging the president Tuesday to take action to prevent Americans from being improperly locked out of the financial system. </p>\n<p>The top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee called on Trump to support the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) efforts to combat debanking — the closure of bank accounts that financial institutions consider risky, often with little or no notice.    </p>\n\n<p>“I write to request that you take action on preventing the debanking of too many Americans across the country, including consumers unfairly locked out of the financial system due to overdraft fees, religious affiliation, or political beliefs,” Warren wrote in a letter to Trump. </p>\n<p>“Your Administration can help to address this problem by supporting the ongoing efforts of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the main agency in our government working to stop unfair debanking, and directing other agencies to use their authorities to bring an end to this practice,” she added. </p>\n<p>Her call to support the CFPB comes after Trump tapped Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to serve as acting director of the agency Monday. Bessent reportedly halted staff to halt all work, according to The Wall Street Journal. </p>\n<p>GOP lawmakers have long opposed the CFPB, which they argue has overstepped its regulatory authority.  </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Warren argued Tuesday that Bessent’s order to halt work at the agency “will only impede efforts to stop debanking.” She pointed to several proposed or finalized rules from the CFPB that would bar debanking based on political or religious affiliation and provide debanked customers notice and the ability to appeal account closures. </p>\n<p>The Massachusetts Democrat said her staff has identified thousands debanking-related complaints in the past three years, with more than half of those complaints lodged against four major banks — Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup. </p>\n\n<p>The letter marks a rare moment of alignment between the progressive senator and Trump. The president took aim at debanking, and Bank of America in particular, during a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. </p>\n<p>During an exchange with Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, Trump accused his bank and other financial institutions of refusing to do business with conservatives. </p>\n<p>“I hope you start opening your bank to conservatives, because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America,” Trump said. </p>\n<p>GOP lawmakers quickly jumped on the bandwagon, with House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) <a data-id=\"https://thehill.com/business/5105371-crypto-debanking-investigation/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://thehill.com/business/5105371-crypto-debanking-investigation/\">opening an investigation</a> into debanking and Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott (R-S.C.) announcing a hearing on the topic. </p>\n</div>",

But beneath the headlines was a spot-on strategic instinct. Greenland is a rapidly rising geopolitical heavyweight the U.S. cannot afford to ignore.  </p>\n<p>As Russia expands its Arctic military footprint and China pours billions into securing long-term access to the Arctic region, Greenland is steadily moving toward independence. The real question isn’t whether the U.S. should engage, but how — and whether we will act before Beijing or Moscow fills the void. </p>\n\n<p>To secure U.S. leadership in the Arctic, Congress must move beyond symbolic gestures and adopt a bold, bipartisan strategy that deepens U.S.-Greenland ties, strengthens Arctic security, and lays the groundwork for Greenland’s eventual NATO membership.  </p>\n<p>Russia and China aren’t waiting around in the Arctic, and neither should the U.S. Moscow is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/graphics/ARCTIC-SECURITY/zgvobmblrpd/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ramping up its military presence</a> with new bases, nuclear-capable missiles and its most capable naval fleet. At the same time, Beijing is <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jan/05/2002560338/-1/-1/0/ARCTIC%20BLUEPRINT%202021%20FINAL.PDF/ARCTIC%20BLUEPRINT%202021%20FINAL.PDF\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">building more nuclear-powered icebreakers</a>, pouring billions into <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/08/02/nx-s1-5052089/pentagon-sounds-alarm-over-russia-china-cooperation-in-the-arctic\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dual-use Arctic research and infrastructure</a> and sailing its Navy further north.  </p>\n<p>Right in the middle of it all is Greenland — a resource-rich island with enormous strategic value to the U.S. and NATO.  </p>\n<p>To bolster defense, lawmakers should direct the Department of Defense to assess the feasibility of forward-basing elements of a <a href=\"https://seapowermagazine.org/admiral-cool-to-notion-of-separate-arctic-fleet/?print=print\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Arctic Fleet</a> in Greenland, incorporating this review into the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act. Washington should also work with Copenhagen and Nuuk to invest in joint military infrastructure, including port expansions and improved airstrips, to support NATO operations in the High North.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>To improve intelligence-sharing, Congress should fund the establishment of a NATO Arctic Intelligence Fusion Center in Nuuk, modeled after <a href=\"https://web.ifc.bices.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">similar initiatives</a> in Eastern Europe. This would provide real-time surveillance of Russian and Chinese activity, giving the U.S. and its allies better situational awareness in an increasingly navigable and contested Arctic region. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Greenland’s independence efforts will require a roadmap for transitioning from Danish military protection to self-defense. Congress should direct the Defense Department to develop a plan that helps Greenland build its own defense capabilities — ensuring it can secure its borders and contribute to regional stability. </p>\n\n<p>Greenland isn’t just an Arctic stronghold — it’s sitting on a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/greenland-trump-climate-change-minerals-trade-bab5bb60ba52f6073f056fb271c43215\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">goldmine of rare earth elements</a>, crucial for U.S. defense systems, semiconductors, and renewable energy technology. With China controlling more than 70 percent of global rare earth production, the U.S. needs an alternative supply chain before it’s too late. </p>\n<p>Congress should introduce the U.S.-Greenland Rare Earth Security Act<em>,</em> which would offer tax incentives and loan guarantees for U.S. companies investing in Greenland’s mining sector. Expanding the <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R43767\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Defense Production Act </a>to prioritize Greenland as a strategic supplier of critical minerals would further reduce America’s reliance on Beijing. </p>\n<p>A U.S.-Greenland Strategic Minerals Partnership could streamline regulatory cooperation, fast-track mining projects and promote environmentally responsible extraction — ensuring Greenland benefits economically while reinforcing U.S. supply chain security. This is a win-win: Greenland gains independence from Danish subsidies, and the U.S. secures a reliable source of rare earth elements. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Greenland is moving <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/greenland-prime-minister-mute-egede-independence-denmark-colonialism-donald-trump-arctic/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">toward independence</a>, but it doesn’t want to be absorbed by another country. Instead, it wants strategic partnerships that allow it to stand <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/greenland-poll-mute-egede-donald-trump-takeover-united-states/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on its own</a>. That’s where a compact of free association comes in.</p>\n<p>Modeled after U.S. agreements with Pacific nations like Palau and the Marshall Islands, <a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/feature/its-time-us-greenland-free-association-agreement-213327/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a compact of free association with Greenland </a>would formalize military, economic and diplomatic ties without compromising Greenland’s sovereignty. Congress should request a State, Interior, and Defense Department feasibility study to assess the benefits of such a compact, laying the groundwork for introducing the U.S.-Greenland COFA Authorization Act<em> </em>to begin formal negotiations. </p>\n<p>To ensure Greenland’s transition to independence is successful, Congress should also create a Greenland Independence Transition Fund, which would provide targeted investments in governance, infrastructure and workforce development — helping Greenland reduce reliance on Danish subsidies while preparing for NATO integration. </p>\n\n<p>The U.S. can’t just treat Greenland as a security asset — it needs to invest in Greenland’s economic future. Congress should support expanding the U.S. consulate in Nuuk, increasing diplomatic staff focused on trade, education, and Arctic governance. Launching a U.S.-Greenland Business Council and U.S.-Greenland Arctic Innovation Fund would encourage American companies to invest in Greenland’s renewable energy, fisheries, and infrastructure projects.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-26051-3_10\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Investing in education</a> and workforce development will also be critical. Congress should establish a U.S.-Greenland Education Exchange Initiative <em>— </em>modeled after the <a href=\"https://us.fulbrightonline.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fulbright Program</a><em> — </em>STEM<em> </em>scholarships, teacher training partnerships and vocational programs in critical industries like mining and energy.  </p>\n<p>Congress has an opportunity to lead now. Holding House Foreign Affairs Committee hearings on Greenland’s strategic role, introducing the U.S.-Greenland COFA Authorization Act, and organizing a congressional delegation to Greenland should be immediate priorities in 2025. </p>\n\n<p>This bold, bipartisan strategy ensures that as Greenland moves toward independence, it does so as a committed U.S. ally — aligned with Western values and fully integrated into NATO. The window of opportunity is closing, and America must lead now. </p>\n<p><em>Walter Berbrick is a senior military analyst with Netsimco, a Saalex Company.
