In addition to Beijing, the president also imposed 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico over the weekend, although both countries reached agreements for a 30-day pause.  </p>\n<p>China responded Monday with a 15 percent tariff on liquefied natural gas and coal and a 10 percent tariff on crude oil, pickup trucks, agricultural machinery and large-displacement cars.  </p>\n<p>It also announced plans to impose export controls on several critical elements, including tellurium, bismuth, tungsten, indium and molybdenum.   </p>\n<p>“The US’s unilateral imposition of tariffs seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization,” China’s State Council Tariff Commission said. “It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems but also undermines the normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the US.”   </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>The tech industry is likely to be a key factor in the U.S.-China trade war.

American AI firms, like OpenAI, Meta and Microsoft, have committed billions of dollars to securing chips and building out data centers.</p>\n<p>After DeepSeek surged to the top of the Apple App Store last week, investors panicked, triggering a significant sell-off in the tech sector that saw chipmaker Nvidia lose $600 billion in a single day.  </p>\n<p>However, some have cast doubt on DeepSeek’s claims about its R1 model, including the total cost of training and whether more advanced chips were used. U.S. officials are reportedly investigating whether DeepSeek managed to circumvent American export controls to obtain advanced chips through Singapore, according to Bloomberg.</p>\n</div>",

He signed an executive order to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5104168-trump-attacks-diversity-equity-inclusion/\">end such practices</a> shortly after assuming office.

Target joined the likes of Tractor Supply Co, McDonald’s and Walmart. </p>\n<p>Goodell referred to the Rooney Rule, which was introduced in 2003 and requires teams to interview at least one minority candidate for a head coaching gig, when emphasizing the NFL’s commitment to DEI. </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>“There’s no requirement to hire a particular individual on the basis of race or gender.

In 2024, the Republicans’ lead was 46-45 percent; in 2023, it was 45-43 percent and in 2022, it was 45-44 percent. </p>\n<p>Prior to these three years, the last time Gallup found Republicans leading in this metric was 1991; the last time Republicans were even tied was 2011.</p>\n<p>If this is bad news for Democrats, there’s still worse. <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/655190/political-parties-historically-polarized-ideologically.aspx?utm_source=gallup_brand&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=front_page_3_january_01212025&amp;utm_term=information&amp;utm_content=full_story_textlink_7\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gallup also found</a> that liberals are still America’s smallest ideological group — 25 percent of the public versus 37 percent conservatives and 34 percent moderates — even as Democrats become decidedly more liberal. In 2024, Gallup found that liberals comprised 55 percent of the party — an all-time high.</p>\n<p>Liberals’ rise within the Democrat party has been remarkably fast. Despite their stereotype, had never been a majority among Democrats until 2018. As recently as 2011, liberals were just 39 percent of Democrats; as recently as 2002, they were just 29 percent; in 1997, only 27 percent of Democrats were liberals. </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>In just one generation, then, liberals have doubled their percentage within the Democratic Party. </p>\n<p>In politics, it is always dangerous to move away from the leading ideological group; it is even more so when you are moving so strongly toward the smallest ideological minority. Yet Democrats’ plight is worse still.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last three years, Republicans have made notable gains with many demographic groups — from 27 percent to 36 percent among Hispanics and from 12 percent to 17 percent among Blacks. However, their improvement from 33 percent to 39 percent of young voters is especially significant. Not only has this been a particularly strong Democrat bloc historically, but age cohorts exhibit a pattern of becoming more conservative over time.</p>\n<p>Presidential <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2024/exit-polls/national-results/general/president/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">exit polling in 2024</a> showed that Kamala Harris’s largest lead among voters based on age was her 11-point margin among 18- to 29-year-olds. With 30 to 44-year-olds, Harris’s lead was just four points. And among 45 to 64-year-olds and 65-and-older voters, she lost.</p>\n<p>The danger in losing ground among younger voters now is that when this group moves up the age scale, they could become even more conservative than voters in today’s older cohorts — groups Democrats are already losing.  </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>In essence, Democrats need big majorities among younger voters to offset later future losses as they age. And older cohorts are especially important, because they comprise such a large portion of the electorate: in 2024, those 45 and older were 63 percent of voters, while those 18-44 were just 37 percent.</p>\n<p>Democrats find themselves stuck between two negative trends: increasingly dependent on America’s smallest ideological minority for support, while their most supportive age cohort is less liberal and likely to become even more conservative.</p>\n<p>Obviously, the political answer for Democrats is to become more moderate. But as recent actions show, they’re not budging from their losing leftist ideology. If anything, they’re becoming more adamantly liberal.</p>\n\n<p>An early example came right after Trump’s victory when Democratic <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democratic-governors-vow-protect-states-trump-policies-rcna179295\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">officials</a> pronounced resistance to the incoming Trump administration — on actions like <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/23/democrat-attorneys-general-trump-mass-deportations-00191332\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">illegal immigration</a>, <a href=\"https://earth.org/us-states-poised-to-lead-the-way-on-climate-during-second-trump-term/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">environmental extremism</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/pritzker-vows-illinois-boost-sex-changes-trump-victory\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">transgender surgeries</a> on children. The same indication has manifested itself in two early House votes.</p>\n<p>The first was the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/5\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Laken Riley Act</a>, to strengthen law enforcement’s hand against illegal immigrants who commit crimes. Although it passed on Jan. 25 with bipartisan support, only 23 percent of House Democrats voted for it. The second was the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, which <a href=\"https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202512\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">passed Jan. 14</a> with only two of 215 Democrats voting for it.</p>\n<p>The reason for Democrats’ seemingly oblivious political positioning is clear from the earlier <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/655190/political-parties-historically-polarized-ideologically.aspx?utm_source=gallup_brand&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=front_page_3_january_01212025&amp;utm_term=information&amp;utm_content=full_story_textlink_7\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">polling data</a>. Liberals make up 55 percent of their supporters; moderates are only 34 percent and self-identified conservatives only 9 percent. Democrats cannot just walk away from politically poor liberal positions because the liberal majority in their party will not let them.</p>\n\n<p>Democrats’ problems are deeper than they seem. It is one thing to lose an election. It is another altogether to lose an electorate. Democrats’ current trajectory leads toward long-term minority status. And it’s not clear who or what could pull their own majority back from the brink or their party away from its base.</p>\n<p><em>J.T. Young is the author of the <u><a href=\"https://amplifypublishinggroup.com/author/james-t-young/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>recent </em>book</a></u>, “Unprecedented Assault: How Big Government Unleashed America’s Socialist Left” from RealClear Publishing.
