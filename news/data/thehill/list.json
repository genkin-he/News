Gen. Keith Kellogg does not yet have an overall plan to end the war in Ukraine — at least not one that President Trump is willing to support. </p>\n<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Megyn Kelly last Friday that the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42nQDD2-wbc&amp;t=404s\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Trump administration believes</a> the war has been fought to a “stalemate,” and that “it is not going to end with the maximalist goals of either” Russia or Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin disagrees. He remains dead-set on the total destruction of Ukraine and continues to insist on its <a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-january-20-2025\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">absolute submission</a>. His advisor, <a href=\"https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/01/14/ukraine-may-cease-to-exist-in-2025-putin-aide-says-a87610\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nikolai Patrushev</a>, went further: “It can’t be ruled out that Ukraine will cease to exist at all in the coming year.”</p>\n<p>The Kremlin believes time is now on its side, especially now that Trump has <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trumps-ukraine-envoy-has-a-hard-climb-to-any-peace-deal-ac728e58\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tasked Kellogg</a> with finding a negotiated solution in 100 days or less. </p>\n<p>A quick negotiated solution means ending the war on Putin’s terms. Moscow is still demanding Ukraine’s <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/5103281-putin-end-game-ukraine/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">complete capitulation</a> — territorial concessions, Ukrainian neutrality, and unilateral disarmament.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/putins-peace-plan-is-actually-a-call-for-ukraines-capitulation/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Putin is also insisting</a> that Ukraine would have to “give up its pursuit of NATO membership” and accept “extensive limitations on the size of its armed forces and on the kinds of weapons systems it is allowed to possess.” </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Each of these is a non-starter for Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Essentially, Putin is demanding Kellogg embark on an ill-advised road to a modern-day <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/yalta-conf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Yalta Conference</a>. Near the end of World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill effectively conceded Eastern Europe at Yalta to Soviet leader Josef Stalin in exchange for Stalin agreeing to fight Japan. The result? Forty-three years of the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Iron-Curtain\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Iron Curtain</a> in Europe.</p>\n\n<p>Kellogg needs to channel his inner Gen. George Patton and tell Trump that he is on a road to nowhere with Putin.</p>\n<p>The Kremlin is betting on Trump being strategically distracted in the Indo-Pacific — as Roosevelt was at the end of World War II — and getting everything he wants in Eastern Europe and in the Caucasian nations of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. Putin has made no secret about it. </p>\n<p>Russia has repeatedly rejected the Kellogg proposal to <a href=\"https://english.nv.ua/russian-war/russia-no-frozen-conflict-blames-nato-for-fueling-ukraine-war-50474790.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">freeze the war</a>. Moscow will not accept the presence of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-rejects-idea-nato-peacekeepers-ukraine-warning-uncontrollable-escalation-2025-01-23/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">European peace-keeping forces</a> in Ukraine. And despite the Ukrainian Constitution saying otherwise, Putin considers Zelensky an <a href=\"https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/01/29/putin-says-ukraine-peace-talks-possible-but-not-with-zelensky-a87775\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">illegitimate leader</a>, since his presidential term expired last year. As a consequence, he will not negotiate directly with him.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-less-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>It is therefore ill-advised for Kellogg to <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/us-urges-ukraine-to-hold-elections-after-ceasefire-trumps-envoy-tells-reuters/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">urge Ukraine</a> to hold elections after any ceasefire. Moscow is performing poorly on the battlefield but excels at election interference. Recent elections in <a href=\"https://www.usip.org/publications/2024/11/russian-interference-2024-moldovan-presidential-election-and-constitutional\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Moldova</a>, <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/a/accused-of-interference-in-georgia-russia-pumps-up-anti-us-propaganda-/7846721.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Georgia</a> and <a href=\"https://ecfr.eu/article/romanias-election-crisis-a-stark-warning-for-nato-nations-on-russian-meddling/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Romania</a> are highly dispositive, a foreshadowing of what would come. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Putin is continuing his assault on Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Over the weekend, Russia launched ballistic missiles on <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-targets-odesa-historical-center/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Odesa’s historic city center</a>, a UNESCO designated World Heritage site. Multiple historic buildings were damaged and seven people were injured. <a href=\"https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/02/1/7496315/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Norwegian diplomats</a> visiting the city narrowly escaped the strikes. In March 2024, Greek Prime Minister <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/06/europe/russia-missile-odesa-greece-russia-zelensky-intl/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kyriakos Mitsotakis</a> also avoided a missile strike in Odesa within 500 meters of his convoy.</p>\n\n<p>Kellogg, for now, is struggling to set conditions for any meaningful negotiations. Putin is clearly waiting for a face-to-face meeting with Trump in what he hopes becomes a second Yalta-like conference.</p>\n<p>Wittingly or not, Kellogg is trapped in a Monty Hall-like “Let’s Make a Deal” modus operandi of his own making — as opposed to a more forceful “this is what you are going to do” approach to Putin and his cronies in the Kremlin. This peace deal is more in the short-term interests of the U.S. and not the victim — Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Presently, Kellogg has no negotiating leverage. There are signs that may change. On Monday, Trump announced that he wants <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/trump-says-he-wants-ukraine-supply-us-with-rare-earths-2025-02-03/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ukraine to repay the U.S.</a> with rare earth minerals valued at “close to $300 billion.” Kellogg would be wise to remind Trump that parts of the illegally Russian-occupied Donbas are rich in natural resources.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/08/10/ukraine-russia-energy-mineral-wealth/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Donbas</a> “harbors some of the world’s largest reserves of titanium and iron ore, fields of untapped lithium and massive deposits of coal. Collectively, they are worth tens of trillions of dollars.” </p>\n<p>So Ukraine is more than capable of paying its way forward. It is time Kellogg reminded Putin of that reality.</p>\n<p>But Putin will only get that message to the extent that his nose is bloodied on the battlefield. He survived Biden’s “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/4717787-bidens-just-enough-strategy-in-ukraine-is-not-nearly-enough-to-defeat-putin/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">just enough</a>” war in Ukraine, and now he believes he can outlast Trump. </p>\n\n<p>Kellogg can disabuse Putin of that notion by empowering the Armed Forces of Ukraine to take the fight to the Russians, and to do so now.</p>\n<p>Russia has been severely militarily weakened. After nearly three years of war, Putin has suffered an estimated <a href=\"https://x.com/DefenceU/status/1886302598883336485\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">841,660 casualties</a> — <a href=\"https://x.com/DefenceU/status/1886375742331932680\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">48,240</a> in January alone — and combined tens of thousands of tanks, armored fighting vehicles, artillery systems, multiple rocket launch systems, aircraft, helicopters, warships, and vehicles.</p>\n<p>The only way for Kellogg to create decisive negotiating leverage and stop the killing in Ukraine is to defeat Russia and drive it out of the country. That involves the use of all the instruments on national power: diplomatic, information, military and economy, <a data-id=\"4874708\" data-type=\"post\" href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/4874708-biden-diplomatic-power-ukraine/\">or DIME</a>. </p>\n\n<p>New sanctions, coordinating with OPEC to drive down the cost of oil, and targeting shadow fleets alone will not bring Putin to the negotiation table. The hammer — the punch to the face — must come from the military instrument of national power. While Ukraine is effectively targeting oil refineries, they must take pressure off their front-line units in the close fight, and that requires interdiction.</p>\n<p>This entails targeting Russian, North Korean and Chechen forces, their equipment, weapons, ammunition, fuel, supplies in Russia before they enter Ukraine. It means targeting them in their assembly areas, at the seaports, airports, and railheads, ammunition storage areas and fuel depots. Only when Putin feels threatened with the loss of his army will he come to the negotiation table — sanctions will not do that.</p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4329764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600\" srcset=\"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w\" width=\"600\"/></a></figure>\n<p>Putin will negotiate with Kellogg, but only when he is made to realize he has truly lost on the battlefields of Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Anything less, and it is likely Yalta 2.0 whenever Putin and Trump meet.

Trump said the Palestinians who have lived in Gaza have “lived a miserable existence.” He suggested other countries <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/04/trump-netanyahu-meeting/\">invest millions of dollars</a> to create “numerous sites or one large site” where Palestinians could relocate.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Netanyahu — who during the press conference called Trump “the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House” — said that he was open to the idea.</p>\n<p><em>“You say things others refuse to say and after the jaws drop, people scratch their heads and they say, ‘You know, he’s right,’” </em>Netanyahu said. <em>“President Trump is taking it to a much higher level. … He sees a different future for that piece of land. It’s worth paying attention to this. We’re talking about it.

The plan was developed by Trump’s son-in-law <strong>Jared Kushner</strong>, whose background is in real estate development. </p>\n<p>Asked about the possibility of sending U.S. troops to Gaza, Trump said the U.S. will “do what is necessary” as he laid out plans for the U.S. to take the area over in “a long-term ownership position,” and he suggested he would visit the territory. </p>\n<p>Gaza is not a sovereign land and is considered under international law to be occupied territory.</p>\n\n<p><em>“A U.S. invasion of Gaza would lead to the slaughter of thousands of U.S. troops and decades of war in the Middle East,”</em> Sen. <strong>Chris Murphy</strong> (D-Conn.) <a href=\"https://x.com/chrismurphyct/status/1886934775618834692?s=46\">wrote on the social platform X</a>.<em> “It’s like a bad, sick joke.”</em></p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/deranged-problematic-bipartisan-lawmakers-bash-trumps-gaza-proposal-rcna190733\">NBC News</a>: “Deranged” and “problematic”: Bipartisan lawmakers bash Trump’s Gaza proposal.</p>\n<p>▪ <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/world-reacts-to-trumps-gaza-proposal/\">Politico</a>: Trump’s Gaza plan sparks backlash in the Middle East.</p>\n\n<p>The proposal underscores Trump’s broad approach to the region and appears to give little consideration to what Palestinians have said they want. Gazans generally want to stay on their land, and neighboring Arab nations have fiercely opposed handing over territory because they do not want to aid an Israeli expulsion of Palestinians. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan have resisted Trump’s attempts to convince them to take in Palestinians during the reconstruction of Gaza, a process he has said could take 10 or 15 years.

But Trump said he doubted whether the Palestinian Authority, the ruling body in the West Bank, could administer Gaza.</p>\n<p><em>“Well it’s had a pretty hard time wouldn’t you say?”</em> he said. <em>“I’d say it’s had a pretty bad time of it.”</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<p><strong>SMART TAKE with NewsNation’s BLAKE BURMAN</strong>:</p>\n<p>Here’s some video you don’t see every day, perhaps ever.

The outlets also receive a smaller portion of their financing from the federal government and member stations.</p>\n\n<p>NPR said in a statement to The Hill it is “confident any review of our programming and underwriting practices will confirm NPR’s adherence to these rules.”</p>\n<p>GOP lawmakers are putting a spotlight on NPR and PBS, too.</p>\n<p>On Monday, a House subcommittee on government efficiency headed by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) called on the outlets’ executives to testify at a hearing concerning “the systemically biased news coverage produced on behalf of federally funded radio and TV stations.”</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>“Since its inception, NPR has collaborated with local nonprofit public media organizations to fill critical needs for news and information in America’s communities,” NPR said in a statement to The Hill. “We welcome the opportunity to discuss the critical role of public media in delivering impartial, fact-based news and reporting to the American public.”</p>\n<p>The latest targeting of public broadcasters comes as the White House has embraced more social and independent media platforms in lieu of mainstream news outlets, several of which the president decried or sued along the campaign trial.</p>\n<p>Some observers pointed to a line in Carr’s letter that questioned “why Congress should continue sending taxpayer dollars to NPR and PBS given the changes in the media marketplace since the passage of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.”</p>\n\n<p>Ellen Goodman, a professor of media policy and law at Rutgers, noted that comment was a telling one.</p>\n<p>“The public broadcasters have struggled for a long time with diversifying their audiences not just in terms of age but across all demographics,” Goodman said. “Still, it’s clear from Carr’s rhetoric there certainly is an interest in going after media whose content is objectionable, and that presents a big First Amendment problem.”</p>\n<p>Several journalists at NPR and member stations declined to comment on the record when contacted by The Hill. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p>NPR has long been on the receiving end of attacks from conservatives and allies of the current administration. It famously left the social platform X after owner Elon Musk attached an official “state media” label to its account.</p>\n<p>Musk, who now leads Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, on Monday reiterated calls to “defund NPR,” saying the outlet “should survive on its own.”</p>\n<p>FCC Commissioner Anna M. Gomez, who was nominated to her position by former President Biden in 2023, criticized Carr’s posture.</p>\n\n<p> “This appears to be yet another Administration effort to weaponize the power of the FCC,” she <a href=\"https://x.com/AGomezFCC/status/1885047186028728499\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wrote in a post</a> on social media responding to Carr’s letter. “The FCC has no business intimidating and silencing broadcast media.”</p>\n<p>It is unclear how far the Trump administration will go in its efforts toward NPR and other public media outlets, though some are anticipating it could reach a fever pitch.</p>\n<p>“NPR opens itself up to criticism from people who don’t want them around because they’re getting some government funding,” said Juan Williams, who worked at the public broadcaster for a decade before becoming a senior political analyst at Fox News.</p>\n\n<p>“My concern is now the Trump people are saying they don’t even think they should have [private] underwriters because they see that as a way to absolutely kill them off.”</p>\n</div>",

Any data that you’re putting into DeepSeek, that is through the app or through a DeepSeek model available on the internet, that is collected and goes to China,” said Oliver Roberts, co-head of the AI Practice Group at law firm Holtzman Vogel. </p>\n<p>DeepSeek exploded onto the scene last month with its R1 model, quickly rising to the top of Apple’s App Store and overtaking OpenAI’s ChatGPT.  </p>\n<p>The model’s rapidly growing popularity, along with the Chinese AI startup’s impressive claims about its development, sent investors into a panic about American-made AI, sparking a mass sell-off in the tech sector.  </p>\n<p>DeepSeek claims to have built the R1 model using just a few thousand reduced-capacity chips from Nvidia, for a measly overall cost of $5.6 million. This contradicted the assumption of American firms that massive investment in AI infrastructure is necessary to advance the technology. </p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Microsoft plans to invest $80 billion in data centers throughout 2025, while Meta will nearly double its spending on capital expenditures this year to between $60 billion and $65 billion. </p>\n<p>OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank have also taken the lead on the Trump administration’s new Stargate project that plans to invest up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the next four years.  </p>\n\n<p>Even as worries abound about what DeepSeek means for American-made AI, other concerns are arising from the Chinese startup’s privacy policies.  </p>\n<p>DeepSeek automatically collects data on IP addresses, key stroke patterns and cookies, which is stored on “secure servers located in the People’s Republic of China.”  </p>\n<p>This raises the prospect that U.S. user data could end up in the hands of the Chinese government, which can legally compel Chinese companies to turn over data, not unlike U.S. law enforcement. </p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>This data could then be used to profile Americans or manipulate algorithms to target propaganda, Roberts suggested.  </p>\n<p>He cautioned that businesses using DeepSeek could risk opening up their trade secrets to China, which has a poor track record on intellectual property protections. </p>\n<p>DeepSeek also currently lacks numerous privacy controls that exist in most other AI models, noted Rob Lee, chief of research and head of staff at SANS Institute, a cybersecurity firm.  </p>\n\n<p>“Unlike OpenAI — which, while imperfect, has a stronger commitment to privacy and anonymization — DeepSeek collects and indefinitely stores massive amounts of user data in China, without clear anonymization measures,” Lee said in a statement. </p>\n<p>“That’s a significant risk, not just from a security standpoint, but in terms of potential data misuse, regulatory concerns, and overall trust in AI systems,” he added. </p>\n<p>The Hill has reached out to DeepSeek for comment.</p>\n\n<p>Some companies have sought to take advantage of the open-source nature of DeepSeek’s models to alleviate these concerns. Perplexity AI has made DeepSeek’s R1 available but is hosting the model “exclusively in US &amp; EU data centers” so that “your data never leaves Western servers.” </p>\n<p>“I think it’s really important to distinguish between the DeepSeek products, which is their app, website and their API, and then the open-source model weights,” Dmitry Shevelenko, Perplexity’s chief business officer, told The Hill. </p>\n<p>“The product is very dangerous and scary because they are not only sending all your prompts and questions to China, they’re doing scary tracking of your activity on your device as well that they can get access to,” he continued. </p>\n\n<p>“The flip side is the model weights, which are open source,” Shevelenko added. “We were able to take those and put them ourselves in a U.S. data center and quickly make that available in Perplexity as one of the models.” </p>\n<p>The national security and data privacy concerns emerging around DeepSeek echo the worries that surrounded TikTok and ultimately led Congress to pass a law requiring its China-based parent company ByteDance to sell the app or face a ban. </p>\n<p>The law received wide bipartisan support amid concerns the Chinese government could access U.S. user data and potentially manipulate the content they see on the popular video-sharing platform. More than 170 million Americans use the app, according to TikTok. </p>\n\n<p>The ban was set to go into effect Jan. 19. However, it is currently on hold after President Trump barred enforcement for 75 days amid efforts to reach a deal to keep the app available in the U.S. </p>\n<p>Several lawmakers have already voiced concerns to the new Trump administration about DeepSeek. </p>\n<p>In a letter to national security adviser Mike Waltz last week, Reps. John Moolenaar (R-Mich.) and Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) urged him to consider prohibiting the federal government from acquiring AI systems based on Chinese models, like DeepSeek. They also asked the administration to restrict the use of these models in critical infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p>Moolenaar and Krishnamoorthi are the top lawmakers on the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). </p>\n<p>“[I]t is clear we are at an inflection point in the AI market where PRC AI systems are increasingly available for use in the United States,” they wrote, using an abbreviation for People’s Republic of China (PRC). “It is imperative that we do not allow PRC AI systems to gain significant market share in the United States, while acquiring the data of U.S. users that only further enable the capabilities of the AI system.” </p>\n<p>Amid speculation that DeepSeek managed to circumvent U.S. export controls to obtain more advanced chips, the lawmakers also called on Waltz to consider new restrictions on chip sales.  </p>\n<p>Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) similarly wrote to Howard Lutnick, Trump’s nominee to lead the Commerce Department, on Monday to urge him to close a “loophole” in the export control regime. </p>\n<p>“With last week’s release of DeepSeek’s R1, a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) model that rivals leading U.S. models, we must confront the reality that the PRC challenge to our technological leadership is real, and missteps could seriously undercut our economic and national security,” they said. </p>\n<p>The U.S. developed an increasingly strict export control regime under the Biden administration in an effort to stymie China’s ability to develop artificial intelligence. </p>\n<p>DeepSeek’s rise raises questions about the effectiveness of these controls and the state of the broader tech war between Washington and Beijing. </p>\n<p>“If they have the ability to create models at the same level of complexity as ChatGPT and OpenAI’s products 4.0 as well as o1, then that could put China on pace with the U.S. in terms of AI development, which has broader issues of China’s potential ability to create more advanced military equipment, weapons of mass destruction at a level we haven’t seen,” Roberts added. </p>\n<p>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) banned state officials from using Chinese-owned technology, like DeepSeek, on government-issued devices Friday, saying it “will not allow the Chinese Communist Party to infiltrate our state’s critical infrastructure through data-harvesting AI and social media apps.”</p>\n</div>",

Doing so would likely produce a much smaller number by which the tax legislation would add to the deficit.</p>\n<p>“That’s a $5 trillion question,” PwC tax expert and longtime Capitol Hill staffer Rohit Kumar told reporters in January, noting the policy baseline method could be used in either a one-bill or two-bill scenario for the Republican agenda. </p>\n<p>Jane Gravelle, senior specialist in economic policy at the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS), said using current policy baseline accounting would be a significant move.</p>\n<p>“It’s obviously a big deal,” Gravelle told The Hill. “Everything having to do with the debt is a big deal, because we’ve got a big problem with the debt.”</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>Despite President Trump’s preference for “one big, beautiful bill” with which to advance his agenda, Republicans may opt for two, after the House GOP failed to reach agreement on a top-line budget number at their retreat in Florida last month. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has said he wants to vote on a number by the end of February.</p>\n<p>If the CBO were asked by Congress to score the costs of the tax legislation relative to a current policy baseline, the agency would do it, while also providing a score based on the primary accounting method, known as the “current law baseline.”</p>\n\n<p>Current law baseline considers the 2017 Trump tax cuts as they are written into law, accounting for the expiration of provisions such as cuts to personal income tax rates.</p>\n<p>The 2017 cuts were made temporary in the first place in order to satisfy the requirements of the budget reconciliation process, a legal workaround that sidesteps the need for 60 votes in the Senate and that Republicans are aiming to use once again.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it’s a difference of assumption — but one with real consequences for the deficit, which ballooned to new highs after the pandemic and is a major concern for many Republicans. Total U.S. debt stock stands now at about $36 trillion, or 120 percent of annual gross domestic product.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>On an annual basis, the budget deficit was $1.83 trillion in 2024; the government collected $4.92 trillion in revenue while spending $6.75 trillion, mostly on health and retirement insurance, defense and interest on the debt.</p>\n<p>The CBO expects that annual shortfall to increase to <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61162\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$2.7 trillion by 2035</a>, a number that doesn’t include the tax cut extensions Republicans are seeking. Total U.S. debt stock will reach $59.3 trillion by 2035, CBO estimates.</p>\n<p>Alex Muresianu, senior policy analyst with the Tax Foundation, called the distinction between the law and policy baselines a “gimmick.”</p>\n\n<p>“The current law baseline, assuming that these tax cuts expire, looks a certain way and then if you assume a current policy baseline where everything is assumed to be extended, then the current policy baseline would be worse. It’s just sort of a gimmick in terms of the actual fiscal position of the United States,” he said.</p>\n<p>It’s not unusual for the CBO to provide lawmakers with accounting projections based on assumptions that differ from current law, if lawmakers request that kind of information, though the agency differentiates between such analyses and considers the letter of the law to be the objective standard.</p>\n<p>For example, the CBO published a <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57627\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cost estimate</a> for the Biden administration’s Build Back Better in November 2021, which Republicans then asked the agency to modify <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-12/57673-BBBA-GrahamSmith-Letter.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">assuming the policies were made permanent</a>, rather than temporary. The estimates differed by an order of magnitude, jumping to $3 trillion from $367 billion.</p>\n\n<p>“Right now they use the current law baseline, which says that in 2026 all these provisions will expire and so to restore them there will be a revenue cost,” Gravelle told The Hill.</p>\n<p>Democrats have used policy baseline accounting projections in the past to advance their own agenda, Kumar noted.</p>\n<p>“Is Congress going to have to officially account for the cost of extending the expiring provisions — just the expiring stuff — or are they going to take the view, as the Obama administration did in 2012, that that which is law today we should just assume [is] permanent?” he said.</p>\n\n<p>“This is a harder question to answer,” Kumar added.</p>\n<p>Republican leadership is well aware of the challenges that lie ahead as it attempts to cut taxes and not explode the deficit.</p>\n<p>“We don’t want to blow a hole in the deficit by extending the Trump-era tax cuts, for example,”  Johnson said on Fox News on Monday. “But we’re definitely going to get that extended. We’ve got to find those savings.”</p>\n\n<p>Johnson said last week that the budget cuts Republicans had been considering amounted to a minimum rather than a maximum, but that minimum appears too low for the party’s deficit hawks. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5124454-gop-trump-agenda-vote-delay/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">told The Hill</a> that $500 billion worth of cuts was a “nonstarter.”</p>\n<p>Some unusual activity in recent months in the bond market, which is sensitive to the deficit, may be signaling further concerns about the national debt.

Leavitt faced Musk questions during a brief Q&amp;A with reporters on Monday amid uproar over the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Leavitt confirmed Musk is serving as a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/04/elon-musk-special-government-employee-meaning/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">special government employee</a>.</p>\n<p>Trump has been publicly supportive of Musk, and his advisers chafe at the suggestion that the tech titan is anything resembling a co-president. </p>\n\n<p>“Elon can’t do, and won’t do, anything without our approval,” Trump told reporters Monday. “And we’ll give him the approval where appropriate, where not appropriate we won’t. … But he does have a good natural instinct, he’s got a team of very talented people. We’re trying to shrink government, and he can probably shrink it as well as anyone else, if not better.”</p>\n<p>After Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) posted on the social platform X that Musk “is a terrible president,” White House communications director Steven Cheung responded: “Tim Walz is a cuck.”</p>\n<p>Musk has been at the center of Trump’s hacksaw to the federal government this week. He has been the main cheerleader for <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5122676-usaid-shutdown-elon-musk-doge/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gutting USAID</a>. His team has been pushing for access to the Treasury Department’s <a href=\"https://thehill.com/business/5124133-democrats-bill-treasury-system-musk/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">payment system</a>, and DOGE staff has  been involved at the Small Business Administration and the Government Services Administration.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>Musk’s actions have led to protests outside the USAID building, outcry from Democrats and some unease from the public. <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/656111/few-major-political-figures-rated-positively-balance.asp\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">A Gallup poll</a> conducted Jan. 21-27 found 43 percent of Americans held a favorable view of Musk, compared to 47 percent who had an unfavorable view, and sustained bad news cycles centered on Musk could frustrate Trump.</p>\n<p>“This Elon thing is going to be over in like three months. Both of these guys want to be the center of attention,” one Republican donor who requested anonymity to speak freely told The Hill.</p>\n<p>But where critics see Musk as an existential threat to government guardrails and a danger to Trump politically, his defenders view him as a revolutionary thinker with the work ethic to actually follow through on Trump’s campaign promises.</p>\n\n<p>“The only legitimate criticism that the Democrats can make is that President Trump has assembled the most highly competent, hardest working, and blazingly efficient Office of the President in American history,” senior White House aide Taylor Budowich posted on X. “The agenda voters demanded WILL BE delivered.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vance’s key role</h2>\n<p>With Musk soaking up significant attention, Vice President Vance has managed to fly somewhat under the radar in the early weeks of the new administration.</p>\n<p>But it was Vance who played a critical part in helping some of Trump’s most controversial Cabinet nominees win over swing senators.</p>\n\n<p>Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) thanked Vance for “his honest counsel” in deciding to support Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s nomination to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. </p>\n<p>Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) also spoke with Vance as he eventually got to a “yes” vote in favor of Tulsi Gabbard’s nomination to serve as director of national intelligence. </p>\n<p>White House officials argued Vance’s Senate connections will prove critical. He is well liked and respected by his former colleagues on the GOP side in particular, those officials said, and Vance has shown an ability to articulate Trump’s beliefs to lawmakers.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The trade war that wasn’t</h2>\n<p>Trump’s trade war that wasn’t with Mexico and Canada offered a lesson in how foreign leaders may try to navigate the next four years.</p>\n<p>The president was poised to impose tariffs on both nations Tuesday, but they were delayed for a month after calls with leaders from both countries. </p>\n<p>Mexico announced it would send 10,000 soldiers to the U.S. border to crack down on fentanyl trafficking. Canada said it would appoint a czar to oversee efforts to stop the flow of fentanyl and would ratchet up its posture toward cartels.</p>\n\n<p>Neither announcement was necessarily groundbreaking on its own, and Canada and Mexico in recent years have increased their efforts to cut down on migrants and drugs crossing the border. But the terms were enough to satisfy Trump, and the White House took a victory lap.</p>\n<p>The lesson for foreign leaders? Even a small gesture to Trump can be enough to avert a damaging dispute.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Foreign leaders flock to White House</h2>\n<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had the honor of being the first foreign leader to meet Trump at the White House, but others aren’t far behind.</p>\n\n<p>Trump will host Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba at the White House on Friday. </p>\n<p>King Abdullah of Jordan is scheduled to meet with Trump on Tuesday. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer are also slated to visit Trump at the White House this month. </p>\n<p>The flurry of visits is reflective of the rush among foreign leaders to get on Trump’s good side and get a feel for what he may do on tariffs and foreign policy in the coming months.</p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"licenseKey\":\"bb199f70cb\",\"applicationID\":\"738543775\",\"transactionName\":\"MQNTMhdXDxECABBZDAhJchMWQg4PTBMLQxdIFl4VEQ==\",\"queueTime\":0,\"applicationTime\":3102,\"atts\":\"HURERF9NHE5BAkYKGBsb\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"agent\":\"\"}</script>\n</div>",

Shortening that timeframe would drastically lower the projected cost of the proposal in scoring. </p>\n<p>A reduction in the overall price tag could help gin up support among hardline conservatives, many of whom are demanding that the package be deficit neutral — a goal that would be more attainable with a lower cost. But it would also shorten the lifespan of the extended tax cuts, a fact that could frustrate some members. Trump has said he wants to make the tax cuts permanent.</p>\n<p>One source said that leadership plans to present the five-year idea to lawmakers during their House GOP conference meeting Wednesday morning, though it remains unclear if it would muster enough support in the slim majority.</p>\n<p>Johnson did not take a position on the five-year idea, another source said.</p>\n<div data-s2n-api=\"minuteMediaS2NApi\" data-stn-player=\"k036p9v5\" id=\"s2n-player\"></div>\n<p>A diverse group of lawmakers were present for the meeting, including Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.), House GOP Conference Vice Chair Blake Moore (R-Utah) and Reps. Chip Roy (R-Texas), David Valadao (R-Calif.), Ben Cline (R-Va.) and Kevin Hern (R-Okla.), according to one of the sources.</p>\n<p>While the viability of the five-year framework remains an open question, the fact that it was floated at all underscores the immense pressure House Republicans are under to move forward on a budget resolution that will include Trump priorities on tax, border enforcement, energy, and more — but will require near unanimity in the razor-thin GOP majority to advance.</p>\n\n<p>The special budget reconciliation process will allow Republicans to circumvent the 60-vote threshold in the Senate and move the bill without needing support from Democrats.</p>\n<p>GOP leaders had aimed to complete a blueprint at their Florida retreat last week and take an initial step to mark up the budget resolution in committee this week, but those seeking steep cuts derailed that plan by balking at an initial budget resolution proposal that featured a $500 billion tax cut floor. While leaders saw that as simply a starting point, fiscal hawks wanted commitments for much higher levels of cuts, with some seeking overall cuts of $2 trillion to $5 trillion.</p>\n<p>Though Johnson earlier on Tuesday had said that movement on the resolution in committee might still be possible, Scalise left the meeting saying Republicans would not be able to move on the markup this week.</p>\n<div class=\"civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3\" data-civicscience-widget=\"3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a\" id=\"civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068\"></div>\n<p>“No,” Scalise succinctly responded when asked if House Republicans could mark up a budget resolution this week.</p>\n<p>“That’s what we’re focused on,” when pressed on if the key vote could happen next week.</p>\n<p>Scalise said that Republicans had raised the floor for cuts from what leaders presented at the House GOP retreat last week, which included ranges of cuts that each committee was tasked to come up with to offset the cost of priorities in the bill. </p>\n\n<p>“We have gone back to each committee to increase those numbers,” Scalise said, signaling that $1 trillion in cuts was realistic.</p>\n<p>But the tricky part is making sure the numbers are right — and that the votes are still there.</p>\n<p>Scalise that there will now be more “front-loading” of the work that leaders had initially expected would take place weeks from now in order to get agreement on the first step in the budget resolution.</p>\n\n<p>“Right now we’re doing is getting a lot more into the details of what the committees would have been doing in March, but we’re doing it now in the context of putting together the budget,” Scalise said. “The Budget Committee wants to be comfortable with numbers that they vote on to give the committees, and they weren’t. So we’re reworking it, but we’re reworking it by also working with the committees to make sure they can pass those —  those numbers.</p>\n<p>Reacting to the struggles on the House side, Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) is set to brief senators on Wednesday about moving first on a budget resolution for an initial, skinny bill that would address border security, energy and defense. That measure would later be followed by a package extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts.</p>\n<p>“We do have a bill ready to go here and Sen. Graham is going to be briefing the conference on that tomorrow at lunch,” Senate Republican Whip John Barrasso (Wyo.) told reporters on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>Fear of a Senate alternative appears to be firing up House Republicans to try to find a solution to their internal conflict.</p>\n<p>“They’re worried about the Senate jamming them on a bill from the Senate, and the Senate would be a light one, it wouldn’t include the tax extension,” one source said when discussing the Tuesday night House Republican meeting.</p>\n<p>Johnson earlier on Tuesday insisted that the House will be spearheading the Trump agenda bill and shut down the idea of the Senate moving first.</p>\n\n<p>“The Senate will not take the lead,” Johnson said earlier on Tuesday. “We’ll take the lead. We’re right on schedule.”</p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"licenseKey\":\"bb199f70cb\",\"applicationID\":\"738543775\",\"transactionName\":\"MQNTMhdXDxECABBZDAhJchMWQg4PTBMLQxdIFl4VEQ==\",\"queueTime\":0,\"applicationTime\":2384,\"atts\":\"HURERF9NHE5BAkYKGBsb\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"agent\":\"\"}</script>\n</div>",
