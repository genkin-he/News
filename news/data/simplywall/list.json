            "description": "<div class=\"sc-11f25c13-4 bGKxSh\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics.  One common approach is to try and find a company with <em>returns</em> on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing <em>amount</em> of capital employed.  Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return.    With that in mind, the ROCE of <strong>Rockwool</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/dk/capital-goods/cph-rock-b/rockwool-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CPH:ROCK B</a>) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.    </p><h2> Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It? </h2><p> If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business.  The formula for this calculation on Rockwool is: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.21 = €669m ÷ (€3.7b - €561m) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024)</em>.</p><p> Thus, <strong>Rockwool has an ROCE of 21%. </strong> That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 10% earned by companies in a similar industry.   </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/dk/capital-goods/cph-rock-b/rockwool-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Rockwool </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/dk/capital-goods/cph-rock-b/rockwool-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-1 kdwwfs\" height=\"316\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/664372-roce-1-dark/1738665901427\" width=\"333\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">CPSE:ROCK B Return on Capital Employed February 4th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> In the above chart we have measured Rockwool's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.  If you'd like, you can  <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/dk/capital-goods/cph-rock-b/rockwool-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Rockwool </a> for <strong>free.</strong> </p><h2> So How Is Rockwool's ROCE Trending? </h2><p> Rockwool is displaying some positive trends.   Over the last  five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 21%.  The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 44%.  This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.   </p><h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> All in all, it's terrific to see that Rockwool is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base.       Since the stock has returned a solid 57% to shareholders over the last  five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes.   In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Rockwool can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.   </p><p> Before jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-11f25c13-4 bGKxSh\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Unfortunately for some shareholders, the <strong>Aurora Cannabis Inc.</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/pharmaceuticals-biotech/tsx-acb/aurora-cannabis-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TSE:ACB</a>) share price has dived 26% in the last thirty days, prolonging recent pain.    The recent drop has obliterated the annual return, with the share price now down 4.9% over that longer period.   </p><p> Although its price has dipped substantially, it's still not a stretch to say that Aurora Cannabis' price-to-sales (or \"P/S\") ratio of 0.9x right now seems quite \"middle-of-the-road\" compared to the Pharmaceuticals industry in Canada, where the median P/S ratio is around 0.7x.  However, investors might be overlooking a clear opportunity or potential setback if there is no rational basis for the P/S.    </p> <p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/pharmaceuticals-biotech/tsx-acb/aurora-cannabis-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Aurora Cannabis </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/pharmaceuticals-biotech/tsx-acb/aurora-cannabis-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ps-multiple-vs-industry\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"325\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/272485300-ps-multiple-vs-industry-1-dark/1738665240654\" width=\"820\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TSX:ACB Price to Sales Ratio vs Industry February 4th 2025</figcaption></figure><h3> What Does Aurora Cannabis' P/S Mean For Shareholders? </h3><p> Aurora Cannabis' revenue growth of late has been pretty similar to most other companies.   The P/S ratio is probably moderate because investors think this modest revenue performance will continue.  If this is the case, then at least existing shareholders won't be losing sleep over the current share price.     </p> Keen to find out how analysts think Aurora Cannabis' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/pharmaceuticals-biotech/tsx-acb/aurora-cannabis-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>free </strong>report is a great place to start</a>. <h2> How Is Aurora Cannabis' Revenue Growth Trending?  </h2><p> The only time you'd be comfortable seeing a P/S like Aurora Cannabis' is when the company's growth is tracking the industry closely.  </p><p> Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 13% gain to the company's revenues.   Revenue has also lifted 25% in aggregate from three years ago, partly thanks to the last 12 months of growth.  Accordingly, shareholders would have probably been satisfied with the medium-term rates of revenue growth.   </p> <p> Looking ahead now, revenue is anticipated to climb by 12% per annum during the coming three years according to the six analysts following the company.  That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 8.3% each year growth forecast for the broader industry. </p><p> With this in consideration, we find it intriguing that Aurora Cannabis' P/S is closely matching its industry peers.  It may be that most investors aren't convinced the company can achieve future growth expectations.  </p> <h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> Aurora Cannabis' plummeting stock price has brought its P/S back to a similar region as the rest of the industry.      Using the price-to-sales ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects. </p><p> We've established that Aurora Cannabis currently trades on a lower than expected P/S since its forecasted revenue growth is higher than the wider industry.  When we see a strong revenue outlook, with growth outpacing the industry, we can only assume potential uncertainty around these figures are what might be placing slight pressure on the P/S ratio.  However, if you agree with the analysts' forecasts, you may be able to pick up the stock at an attractive price.     </p><p> Don't forget that there may be other risks. For instance, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/pharmaceuticals-biotech/tsx-acb/aurora-cannabis-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign for Aurora Cannabis</strong> </a> that you should be aware of.  </p><p> If you're <strong>unsure about the strength of Aurora Cannabis' business</strong>, why not explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-business-fundamentals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals</a> for some other companies you may have missed. </p></div>",

            "title": "Do Its Financials Have Any Role To Play In Driving Weichai Power Co., Ltd.'s (HKG:2338) Stock Up Recently?",
            "description": "<div class=\"sc-11f25c13-4 bGKxSh\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Weichai Power's (HKG:2338) stock is up by a considerable 12% over the past month.   We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes.      In this article, we decided to focus on <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/capital-goods/hkg-2338/weichai-power-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Weichai Power's </a> ROE.   </p><p> Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital.  In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/capital-goods/hkg-2338/weichai-power-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Weichai Power </a></span></p><h2> How Do You Calculate Return On Equity? </h2><p> <strong>Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:</strong> </p><p> Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity </p><p>So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Weichai Power is:</p><p>11% = CN¥14b ÷ CN¥121b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).</p><p> The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months.  That means that for every HK$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated HK$0.11 in profit. </p> <h2> What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? </h2><p> So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability.  Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential.  Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. </p><h2> Weichai Power's Earnings Growth And 11% ROE </h2><p> To begin with, Weichai Power seems to have a respectable ROE.   And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 12%.   Given the circumstances, we can't help but wonder why Weichai Power saw little to no growth in the past five years.  Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth.  For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.    </p><p> Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that the industry grew its earnings by 11% over the last few years.   </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/capital-goods/hkg-2338/weichai-power-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"past-earnings-growth\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"334\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/9283092-past-earnings-growth-1-dark/1738649848859\" width=\"821\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">SEHK:2338 Past Earnings Growth February 4th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.   It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline).  Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous.    If you're wondering about Weichai Power's's valuation, check out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/capital-goods/hkg-2338/weichai-power-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio</a>, as compared to its industry.   </p><h2> Is Weichai Power Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits? </h2> <p> Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 46% (implying that the company keeps 54% of its income) over the last three years, Weichai Power has seen a negligible amount of growth in earnings as we saw above.  So there could be some other explanation in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.   </p> <p> Moreover, Weichai Power has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth.      Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 56% over the next three years.   However, Weichai Power's future ROE is expected to rise to 14% despite the expected increase in the company's payout ratio. We infer that there could be other factors that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE.    </p> <h2> Summary  </h2> <p> Overall, we feel that Weichai Power certainly does have some positive factors to consider.      Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business.       Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-11f25c13-4 bGKxSh\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average.  And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost.  To wit, the BANDAI NAMCO Holdings share price has climbed 89% in five years, easily topping the market return of 53% (ignoring dividends).   On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 23%, including dividends.     </p><p> So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-7832/bandai-namco-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for BANDAI NAMCO Holdings </a></span></p> <p> To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...'  One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price. </p> <p> During five years of share price growth, BANDAI NAMCO Holdings achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 15% per year.    This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 14% average annual increase in the share price.   This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal.  In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.  </p><p> The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail). </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-7832/bandai-namco-holdings-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-per-share-growth\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"520\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/409828-earnings-per-share-growth-1-dark/1738635018948\" width=\"821\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TSE:7832 Earnings Per Share Growth February 4th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> It is of course excellent to see how BANDAI NAMCO Holdings has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders.  It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-7832/bandai-namco-holdings-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">report on how its financial position has changed over time</a>. </p> <h2>What About Dividends?</h2><p> It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock.  The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested.  So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return.  As it happens, BANDAI NAMCO Holdings' TSR for the last 5 years was 110%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier.  And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence! </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> It's nice to see that BANDAI NAMCO Holdings shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 23% over the last year.   And that does include the dividend.     That's better than the annualised return of 16% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently.  Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.        I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

            "title": "These 4 Measures Indicate That YC (KOSDAQ:232140) Is Using Debt Reasonably Well",
            "description": "<div class=\"sc-11f25c13-4 bGKxSh\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.'  It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses.  Importantly, <strong>YC Corporation</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kosdaq-a232140/yc-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">KOSDAQ:232140</a>) does carry debt.  But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky. </p><h2> What Risk Does Debt Bring? </h2><p> Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy.  Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing.  While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price.  By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return.  When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. </p> <p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kosdaq-a232140/yc-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for YC </a></span></p><h2> What Is YC's Debt? </h2><p> As you can see below, at the end of September 2024, YC had ₩84.7b of debt, up from ₩75.5b a year ago. Click the image for more detail.    But on the other hand it also has ₩121.3b in cash, leading to a ₩36.6b net cash position.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kosdaq-a232140/yc-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"526\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/226571001-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark/1738622307368\" width=\"821\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">KOSDAQ:A232140 Debt to Equity History February 3rd 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> How Strong Is YC's Balance Sheet? </h2><p> We can see from the most recent balance sheet that YC had liabilities of ₩72.8b falling due within a year, and liabilities of ₩59.9b due beyond that.   Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of ₩121.3b as well as receivables valued at ₩12.8b due within 12 months.   So its total liabilities are just about perfectly matched by its shorter-term, liquid assets.  </p><p> Having regard to YC's size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities.  So while it's hard to imagine that the ₩799.8b company is struggling for cash, we still think it's worth monitoring its balance sheet.    Succinctly put, YC boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!   </p> <p> In addition to that, we're happy to report that YC has boosted its EBIT by 56%, thus reducing the spectre of future debt repayments.      When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start.  But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if YC can strengthen its balance sheet over time.  So if you're focused on the future you can check out this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kosdaq-a232140/yc-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">report showing analyst profit forecasts</a>. </p><p> But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash.   While YC has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance.    Over the last three years, YC saw substantial negative free cash flow, in total.  While investors are no doubt expecting a reversal of that situation in due course, it clearly does mean its use of debt is more risky.   </p> <h2>Summing Up</h2><p> While we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that YC has net cash of ₩36.6b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities.     And it impressed us with its EBIT growth of 56% over the last year.     So we are not troubled with YC's debt use.    When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start.  However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.   For instance, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kosdaq-a232140/yc-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign for YC</strong> </a> that you should be aware of.   </p> <p> Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/27012/net-cash-stocks-with-a-growth-track-record\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks</a>, today. </p></div>",

Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 3.5%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns.   </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-services/tse-6412/heiwa-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Heiwa </a></span></p> <h2>Heiwa's Payment Could Potentially Have Solid Earnings Coverage</h2> <p> Impressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained.     Prior to this announcement, Heiwa's dividend was only 40% of earnings, however it was paying out 139% of free cash flows.  This signals that the company is more focused on returning cash flow to shareholders, but it could mean that the dividend is exposed to cuts in the future.   </p><p> The next year is set to see EPS grow by 16.0%.   Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 35% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.     </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-services/tse-6412/heiwa-shares/dividend\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"historic-dividend\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"508\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/882148-historic-dividend-1-dark/1738622313772\" width=\"821\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TSE:6412 Historic Dividend February 3rd 2025</figcaption></figure> <h2>Heiwa Has A Solid Track Record</h2> <p> The company has an extended history of paying stable dividends.      Since 2015, the dividend has gone from ¥60.00 total annually to ¥80.00.      This means that it has been growing its distributions at 2.9% per annum over that time.     Slow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think makes this a fairly attractive offer.    </p> <h2>Heiwa Could Grow Its Dividend</h2> <p> Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history.     Heiwa has impressed us by growing EPS at 9.8% per year over the past five years.       The company is paying out a lot of its cash as a dividend, but it looks okay based on the payout ratio.    </p> <h2>Our Thoughts On Heiwa's Dividend</h2> <p> Overall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable.       While Heiwa is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking.      We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.  </p><p> Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one.  Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-11f25c13-4 bGKxSh\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><h3>Key Insights</h3><ul> <li> Institutions' substantial holdings in Airbnb implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price </li> <li> 50% of the business is held by the top 9 shareholders </li> <li> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-abnb/airbnb/ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> 28% of Airbnb is held by insiders</a> </li> </ul><p> Every investor in Airbnb, Inc. (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-abnb/airbnb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NASDAQ:ABNB</a>) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups.  And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 56% ownership.   That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). </p><p> Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors.  Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.   </p><p> In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Airbnb. </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-abnb/airbnb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Airbnb </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-abnb/airbnb/ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ownership-breakdown\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"245\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/115705393-ownership-breakdown-1-dark/1738606979941\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NasdaqGS:ABNB Ownership Breakdown February 3rd 2025</figcaption></figure> <h2>What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Airbnb?</h2><p> Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. </p> <p> We can see that Airbnb does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock.  This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes.  If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Airbnb's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-abnb/airbnb/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"524\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/115705393-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark/1738606981321\" width=\"821\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NasdaqGS:ABNB Earnings and Revenue Growth February 3rd 2025</figcaption></figure> <p> Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions.    Airbnb is not owned by hedge funds.      With a 11% stake, CEO Brian Chesky is the largest shareholder.       For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 9.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.8% by the third-largest shareholder.      Note that two of the top three shareholders are also Top Key Executive and Member of the Board of Directors, respectively, once again pointing to significant ownership by company insiders.       </p> <p> We also observed that the top 9 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.   </p> <p> Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments.   There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.  </p><h2>Insider Ownership Of Airbnb</h2><p> While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders.  Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. </p><p> Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. </p> <p> It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Airbnb, Inc..   It has a market capitalization of just US$82b, and insiders have US$23b worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant.  Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size.

While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.  </p> <h2>Next Steps:</h2><p> It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Airbnb better, we need to consider many other factors.    Take risks for example - Airbnb has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-abnb/airbnb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign </strong> </a> we think you should be aware of.   </p> <p> But ultimately <strong> it is the future</strong>, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-abnb/airbnb/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future</a>. </p> <p><small>NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.
