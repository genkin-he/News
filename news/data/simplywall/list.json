            "description": "<div class=\"sc-11f25c13-4 bGKxSh\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average.  And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost.  To wit, the BANDAI NAMCO Holdings share price has climbed 89% in five years, easily topping the market return of 53% (ignoring dividends).   On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 23%, including dividends.     </p><p> So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-7832/bandai-namco-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for BANDAI NAMCO Holdings </a></span></p> <p> To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...'  One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price. </p> <p> During five years of share price growth, BANDAI NAMCO Holdings achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 15% per year.    This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 14% average annual increase in the share price.   This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal.  In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.  </p><p> The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail). </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-7832/bandai-namco-holdings-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-per-share-growth\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"520\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/409828-earnings-per-share-growth-1-dark/1738635018948\" width=\"821\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TSE:7832 Earnings Per Share Growth February 4th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> It is of course excellent to see how BANDAI NAMCO Holdings has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders.  It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-7832/bandai-namco-holdings-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">report on how its financial position has changed over time</a>. </p> <h2>What About Dividends?</h2><p> It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock.  The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested.  So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return.  As it happens, BANDAI NAMCO Holdings' TSR for the last 5 years was 110%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier.  And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence! </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> It's nice to see that BANDAI NAMCO Holdings shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 23% over the last year.   And that does include the dividend.     That's better than the annualised return of 16% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently.  Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.        I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.   Case in point: We've spotted <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-7832/bandai-namco-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 2 warning signs for BANDAI NAMCO Holdings</strong> </a> you should be aware of, and 1 of them doesn't sit too well with us.    </p><p> Of course, <strong>you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.</strong> So take a peek at this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/19524/growth-stocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of companies we expect will grow earnings.</a> </p><p><em>Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on Japanese exchanges.</em></p></div>",

            "title": "These 4 Measures Indicate That YC (KOSDAQ:232140) Is Using Debt Reasonably Well",
            "description": "<div class=\"sc-11f25c13-4 bGKxSh\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.'  It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses.  Importantly, <strong>YC Corporation</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kosdaq-a232140/yc-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">KOSDAQ:232140</a>) does carry debt.  But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky. </p><h2> What Risk Does Debt Bring? </h2><p> Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy.  Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing.  While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price.  By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return.  When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. </p> <p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kosdaq-a232140/yc-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for YC </a></span></p><h2> What Is YC's Debt? </h2><p> As you can see below, at the end of September 2024, YC had ₩84.7b of debt, up from ₩75.5b a year ago. Click the image for more detail.    But on the other hand it also has ₩121.3b in cash, leading to a ₩36.6b net cash position.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kosdaq-a232140/yc-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"526\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/226571001-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark/1738622307368\" width=\"821\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">KOSDAQ:A232140 Debt to Equity History February 3rd 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> How Strong Is YC's Balance Sheet? </h2><p> We can see from the most recent balance sheet that YC had liabilities of ₩72.8b falling due within a year, and liabilities of ₩59.9b due beyond that.   Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of ₩121.3b as well as receivables valued at ₩12.8b due within 12 months.   So its total liabilities are just about perfectly matched by its shorter-term, liquid assets.  </p><p> Having regard to YC's size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities.  So while it's hard to imagine that the ₩799.8b company is struggling for cash, we still think it's worth monitoring its balance sheet.    Succinctly put, YC boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!   </p> <p> In addition to that, we're happy to report that YC has boosted its EBIT by 56%, thus reducing the spectre of future debt repayments.      When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start.  But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if YC can strengthen its balance sheet over time.  So if you're focused on the future you can check out this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kosdaq-a232140/yc-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">report showing analyst profit forecasts</a>. </p><p> But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash.   While YC has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance.    Over the last three years, YC saw substantial negative free cash flow, in total.  While investors are no doubt expecting a reversal of that situation in due course, it clearly does mean its use of debt is more risky.   </p> <h2>Summing Up</h2><p> While we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that YC has net cash of ₩36.6b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities.     And it impressed us with its EBIT growth of 56% over the last year.     So we are not troubled with YC's debt use.    When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start.  However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.   For instance, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kosdaq-a232140/yc-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign for YC</strong> </a> that you should be aware of.   </p> <p> Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/27012/net-cash-stocks-with-a-growth-track-record\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks</a>, today. </p></div>",

Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 3.5%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns.   </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-services/tse-6412/heiwa-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Heiwa </a></span></p> <h2>Heiwa's Payment Could Potentially Have Solid Earnings Coverage</h2> <p> Impressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained.     Prior to this announcement, Heiwa's dividend was only 40% of earnings, however it was paying out 139% of free cash flows.  This signals that the company is more focused on returning cash flow to shareholders, but it could mean that the dividend is exposed to cuts in the future.   </p><p> The next year is set to see EPS grow by 16.0%.   Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 35% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.     </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-services/tse-6412/heiwa-shares/dividend\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"historic-dividend\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"508\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/882148-historic-dividend-1-dark/1738622313772\" width=\"821\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TSE:6412 Historic Dividend February 3rd 2025</figcaption></figure> <h2>Heiwa Has A Solid Track Record</h2> <p> The company has an extended history of paying stable dividends.      Since 2015, the dividend has gone from ¥60.00 total annually to ¥80.00.      This means that it has been growing its distributions at 2.9% per annum over that time.     Slow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think makes this a fairly attractive offer.    </p> <h2>Heiwa Could Grow Its Dividend</h2> <p> Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history.     Heiwa has impressed us by growing EPS at 9.8% per year over the past five years.       The company is paying out a lot of its cash as a dividend, but it looks okay based on the payout ratio.    </p> <h2>Our Thoughts On Heiwa's Dividend</h2> <p> Overall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable.       While Heiwa is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking.      We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.  </p><p> Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one.  Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 56% ownership.   That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). </p><p> Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors.  Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.   </p><p> In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Airbnb. </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-abnb/airbnb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Airbnb </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-abnb/airbnb/ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ownership-breakdown\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"245\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/115705393-ownership-breakdown-1-dark/1738606979941\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NasdaqGS:ABNB Ownership Breakdown February 3rd 2025</figcaption></figure> <h2>What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Airbnb?</h2><p> Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. </p> <p> We can see that Airbnb does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock.  This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes.  If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Airbnb's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-abnb/airbnb/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"524\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/115705393-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark/1738606981321\" width=\"821\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NasdaqGS:ABNB Earnings and Revenue Growth February 3rd 2025</figcaption></figure> <p> Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions.    Airbnb is not owned by hedge funds.      With a 11% stake, CEO Brian Chesky is the largest shareholder.       For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 9.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.8% by the third-largest shareholder.      Note that two of the top three shareholders are also Top Key Executive and Member of the Board of Directors, respectively, once again pointing to significant ownership by company insiders.       </p> <p> We also observed that the top 9 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.   </p> <p> Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments.   There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.  </p><h2>Insider Ownership Of Airbnb</h2><p> While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders.  Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. </p><p> Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. </p> <p> It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Airbnb, Inc..   It has a market capitalization of just US$82b, and insiders have US$23b worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant.  Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size.

While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.  </p> <h2>Next Steps:</h2><p> It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Airbnb better, we need to consider many other factors.    Take risks for example - Airbnb has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-abnb/airbnb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign </strong> </a> we think you should be aware of.   </p> <p> But ultimately <strong> it is the future</strong>, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

            "title": "These 4 Measures Indicate That MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) Is Using Debt Reasonably Well",
            "description": "<div class=\"sc-11f25c13-4 bGKxSh\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.'  It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses.  Importantly, <strong>MercadoLibre, Inc.</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nasdaq-meli/mercadolibre\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NASDAQ:MELI</a>) does carry debt.  But is this debt a concern to shareholders? </p><h2> When Is Debt Dangerous? </h2><p> Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price.  Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing.  While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price.  Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences.  The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. </p> <p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nasdaq-meli/mercadolibre\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for MercadoLibre </a></span></p><h2> How Much Debt Does MercadoLibre Carry? </h2><p> You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of September 2024 MercadoLibre had US$5.27b of debt, an increase on US$4.40b, over one year.    However, it does have US$6.67b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of US$1.41b.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nasdaq-meli/mercadolibre/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"526\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/34322384-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark/1738588794142\" width=\"821\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NasdaqGS:MELI Debt to Equity History February 3rd 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> How Healthy Is MercadoLibre's Balance Sheet? </h2><p> According to the last reported balance sheet, MercadoLibre had liabilities of US$14.3b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$4.31b due beyond 12 months.   On the other hand, it had cash of US$6.67b and US$9.05b worth of receivables due within a year.   So its liabilities total US$2.90b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.  </p><p> Of course, MercadoLibre has a   titanic  market capitalization of US$97.4b, so these liabilities are probably manageable.  Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse.    Despite its noteworthy liabilities, MercadoLibre boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!   </p> <p> But the other side of the story is that MercadoLibre saw its EBIT decline by 4.9% over the last year.  That sort of decline, if sustained, will obviously make debt harder to handle.      When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start.  But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine MercadoLibre's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward.  So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nasdaq-meli/mercadolibre/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this free report on analyst profit forecasts</a> to be interesting.  </p><p> But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash.   While MercadoLibre has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance.    Happily for any shareholders, MercadoLibre actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last three years.  There's nothing better than incoming cash when it comes to staying in your lenders' good graces.   </p> <h2>Summing Up</h2><p> We could understand if investors are concerned about MercadoLibre's liabilities, but we can be reassured by the fact it has has net cash of US$1.41b.     The cherry on top was that in converted 239% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$6.2b.     So we don't think MercadoLibre's use of debt is risky.      Above most other metrics, we think its important to track how fast earnings per share is growing, if at all. If you've also come to that realization, you're in luck, because today you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nasdaq-meli/mercadolibre/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">view this interactive graph of MercadoLibre's earnings per share history</a> for free.    </p> <p> When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

            "title": "KWS SAAT SE KGaA (ETR:KWS) Is Looking To Continue Growing Its Returns On Capital",
            "description": "<div class=\"sc-11f25c13-4 bGKxSh\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for.  Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's <em>amount</em> of capital employed.  This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns.    So when we looked at <strong>KWS SAAT SE KGaA</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/food-beverage-tobacco/etr-kws/kws-saat-se-kgaa-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ETR:KWS</a>) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.    </p><h2> Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It? </h2><p> For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business.  The formula for this calculation on KWS SAAT SE KGaA is: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.14 = €294m ÷ (€2.7b - €605m) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024)</em>.</p><p> Thus, <strong>KWS SAAT SE KGaA has an ROCE of 14%. </strong> That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 13% generated by the Food industry.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/food-beverage-tobacco/etr-kws/kws-saat-se-kgaa-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for KWS SAAT SE KGaA </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/food-beverage-tobacco/etr-kws/kws-saat-se-kgaa-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-1 kdwwfs\" height=\"316\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/880406-roce-1-dark/1738589768788\" width=\"333\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">XTRA:KWS Return on Capital Employed February 3rd 2025</figcaption></figure><p> In the above chart we have measured KWS SAAT SE KGaA's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.  If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/food-beverage-tobacco/etr-kws/kws-saat-se-kgaa-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">free analyst report for KWS SAAT SE KGaA </a>. </p><h2> So How Is KWS SAAT SE KGaA's ROCE Trending? </h2><p> KWS SAAT SE KGaA's ROCE growth is quite impressive.   The figures show that over the last  five years, ROCE has grown 101% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital.  So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably.  It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.   </p><h2> The Bottom Line </h2><p> To sum it up, KWS SAAT SE KGaA is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive.     Investors may not be impressed by the favorable underlying trends yet because over the last  five years the stock has only returned 14% to shareholders.  Given that, we'd look further into this stock in case it has more traits that could make it multiply in the long term.   </p><p> Before jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-11f25c13-4 bGKxSh\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> It is hard to get excited after looking at Ultrapar Participações' (BVMF:UGPA3) recent performance, when its stock has declined 22% over the past three months.   But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals.     In this article, we decided to focus on <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/energy/bovespa-ugpa3/ultrapar-participacoes-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ultrapar Participações' </a> ROE.   </p><p> Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital.  Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/energy/bovespa-ugpa3/ultrapar-participacoes-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Ultrapar Participações </a></span></p><h2> How Is ROE Calculated? </h2><p> The <strong>formula for ROE</strong> is: </p><p> Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity </p><p>So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Ultrapar Participações is:</p><p>18% = R$2.8b ÷ R$15b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).</p><p> The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year.  Another way to think of that is that for every R$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn R$0.18 in profit. </p> <h2> Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth? </h2><p> So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability.  Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential.  Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. </p><h2> Ultrapar Participações' Earnings Growth And 18% ROE </h2><p> When you first look at it, Ultrapar Participações' ROE doesn't look that attractive.   Yet, a closer study shows that the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 15%.   Particularly, the exceptional 40% net income growth seen by Ultrapar Participações over the past five years is pretty remarkable.  Taking into consideration that the ROE is not particularly high, we reckon that there could also be other factors at play which could be influencing the company's growth.  For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.    </p><p> Next, on comparing Ultrapar Participações' net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 39% over the last few years.   </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/energy/bovespa-ugpa3/ultrapar-participacoes-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"past-earnings-growth\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"334\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/403623-past-earnings-growth-1-dark/1738573591611\" width=\"821\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">BOVESPA:UGPA3 Past Earnings Growth February 3rd 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation.  It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline).   This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future.    What is UGPA3 worth today? The <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/energy/bovespa-ugpa3/ultrapar-participacoes-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> intrinsic value infographic in our free research report </a> helps visualize whether UGPA3 is currently mispriced by the market.   </p><h2> Is Ultrapar Participações Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?  </h2> <p> Ultrapar Participações has a three-year median payout ratio of 34% (where it is retaining 66% of its income) which is not too low or not too high.  So it seems that Ultrapar Participações is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.   </p> <p> Moreover, Ultrapar Participações is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years.      Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 33%.   Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 19%.    </p> <h2> Summary  </h2> <p> In total, it does look like Ultrapar Participações has some positive aspects to its business.      Even in spite of the low rate of return, the company has posted impressive earnings growth as a result of reinvesting heavily into its business.       Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-11f25c13-4 bGKxSh\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average.  And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns.  For example, long term <strong>Danieli &amp; C. Officine Meccaniche S.p.A.</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/it/capital-goods/bit-dan/danieli-c-officine-meccaniche-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BIT:DAN</a>) shareholders have enjoyed a 66% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market decline of around 6.2% (not including dividends).    </p><p> The past week has proven to be lucrative for Danieli &amp; C. Officine Meccaniche investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/it/capital-goods/bit-dan/danieli-c-officine-meccaniche-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Danieli &amp; C. Officine Meccaniche </a></span></p> <p> While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance.  By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. </p> <p> During five years of share price growth, Danieli &amp; C. Officine Meccaniche achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 29% per year.   This EPS growth is higher than the 11% average annual increase in the share price.  Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.   This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 7.76.   </p><p> You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/it/capital-goods/bit-dan/danieli-c-officine-meccaniche-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-per-share-growth\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"520\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/875884-earnings-per-share-growth-1-dark/1738574074331\" width=\"821\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">BIT:DAN Earnings Per Share Growth February 3rd 2025</figcaption></figure><p> It is of course excellent to see how Danieli &amp; C. Officine Meccaniche has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders.  You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/it/capital-goods/bit-dan/danieli-c-officine-meccaniche-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">interactive graphic</a>. </p> <h2>What About Dividends?</h2><p> As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR).  The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested.  Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock.  We note that for Danieli &amp; C. Officine Meccaniche the TSR over the last 5 years was 75%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above.  And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence! </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> While the broader market gained around 23% in the last year, Danieli &amp; C. Officine Meccaniche shareholders lost 12% (even including dividends).  Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested.     Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 12%, each year, over five years.  It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend.        Before forming an opinion on Danieli &amp; C. Officine Meccaniche you might want to consider these <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/it/capital-goods/bit-dan/danieli-c-officine-meccaniche-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 valuation metrics.</a> </p><p> For those who like to find <strong>winning investments</strong> this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/16951/undervalued-small-caps-with-insider-buying\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of undervalued companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.</a> </p><p><em>Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on Italian exchanges.</em></p></div>",
