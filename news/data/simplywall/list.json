However, it's crucial to note that they remain very much invested in the stock and that sale only reduced their holding by 1.1%.    </p> <p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nyse-syk/stryker\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Stryker </a></span></p><h2> The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Stryker </h2> <p> In fact, the recent sale by Independent Director Ronda Stryker was not their only sale of Stryker shares this year.  Earlier in the year, they fetched US$346 per share in a -US$100m sale.     That means that an insider was selling shares at  slightly  below the current price (US$391).  As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation.  Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price.   It is worth noting that this sale was only 1.6% of Ronda Stryker's holding.    </p> <p> Stryker insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.    You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company.   Stryker insiders own about US$15b worth of shares (which is 10% of the company).  Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.  </p><h2> What Might The Insider Transactions At Stryker Tell Us? </h2><p> Insiders  sold Stryker shares recently, but they didn't buy any.     And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year.    It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious.      In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Stryker.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-11f25c13-4 bGKxSh\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Rambus Inc. (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-rmbs/rambus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NASDAQ:RMBS</a>), might not be a large cap stock, but it     received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months.   Shareholders may appreciate the recent price jump, but the company still has a way to go before reaching its yearly highs again.     With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price.  However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price?  Today we will analyse the most recent data on Rambus’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-rmbs/rambus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Rambus </a></span></p><h2> What Is Rambus Worth? </h2><p> The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around  5.15% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Rambus today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $57.39,  there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value.    Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Rambus’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.    </p> <h2> What does the future of Rambus look like? </h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-rmbs/rambus/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"524\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/33604-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark/1738680363180\" width=\"821\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NasdaqGS:RMBS Earnings and Revenue Growth February 4th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio.   Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations.    Rambus' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 62%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.   </p> <h2>What This Means For You</h2> <p><strong>Are you a shareholder?</strong> RMBS’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price,  with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as  the financial strength of the company.  Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough  confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value? </p><p><strong>Are you a potential investor?</strong> If you’ve been keeping an eye on RMBS,  now may not be the most  advantageous  time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the  optimistic prospect  is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth  diving deeper into  other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop. </p> <p> If you want to dive deeper into Rambus, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.   For example, we've discovered <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-rmbs/rambus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>2 warning signs</strong></a> that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Rambus.   </p><p> If you are no longer interested in Rambus, you can use our free platform to see our list of over <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/3401/large-cap-high-growth-potential\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">50 other stocks with a high growth potential.</a> </p></div>",

            "title": "Is Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP) Using Too Much Debt?",
            "description": "<div class=\"sc-11f25c13-4 bGKxSh\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.'  It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses.  We can see that <strong>Advance Auto Parts, Inc.</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nyse-aap/advance-auto-parts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NYSE:AAP</a>) does use debt in its business.  But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt? </p><h2> What Risk Does Debt Bring? </h2><p> Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow.   Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers.  However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet.  Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return.  The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. </p> <p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nyse-aap/advance-auto-parts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Advance Auto Parts </a></span></p><h2> What Is Advance Auto Parts's Debt? </h2><p> As you can see below, Advance Auto Parts had US$1.79b of debt, at October 2024, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail.    On the flip side, it has US$464.5m in cash leading to net debt of about US$1.32b.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nyse-aap/advance-auto-parts/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"526\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/24333-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark/1738680480781\" width=\"821\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NYSE:AAP Debt to Equity History February 4th 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> A Look At Advance Auto Parts' Liabilities </h2><p> Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Advance Auto Parts had liabilities of US$5.59b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$4.28b due beyond that.    Offsetting this, it had US$464.5m in cash and US$668.9m in receivables that were due within 12 months.   So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$8.74b.   </p><p> This deficit casts a shadow over the US$2.88b company, like a colossus towering over mere mortals.   So we'd watch its balance sheet closely, without a doubt.  After all, Advance Auto Parts would likely require a major re-capitalisation if it had to pay its creditors today.  </p> <p> We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short).  This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it. </p> <p> While Advance Auto Parts's debt to EBITDA ratio (2.9) suggests that it uses some debt, its interest cover is very weak, at 1.7, suggesting high leverage.   In large part that's due to the company's significant depreciation and amortisation charges, which arguably mean its EBITDA is a very generous measure of earnings, and its debt may be more of a burden than it first appears.   It seems clear that the cost of borrowing money is negatively impacting returns for shareholders, of late.        Even worse, Advance Auto Parts saw its EBIT tank 30% over the last 12 months.  If earnings keep going like that over the long term, it has a snowball's chance in hell of paying off that debt.      There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet.  But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Advance Auto Parts's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward.  So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nyse-aap/advance-auto-parts/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this free report on analyst profit forecasts</a> to be interesting.  </p><p> Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it.   So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow.    Looking at the most recent three years, Advance Auto Parts recorded free cash flow of 46% of its EBIT, which is weaker than we'd expect.  That weak cash conversion makes it more difficult to handle indebtedness.   </p> <h2>Our View</h2><p> On the face of it, Advance Auto Parts's EBIT growth rate left us tentative about the stock, and its level of total liabilities was no more enticing than the one empty restaurant on the busiest night of the year.    But at least its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is not so bad.      After considering the datapoints discussed, we think Advance Auto Parts has too much debt.  While some investors love that sort of risky play, it's certainly not our cup of tea.    When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start.  But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.   For example, we've discovered <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nyse-aap/advance-auto-parts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>3 warning signs for Advance Auto Parts</strong></a> (1 is concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.   </p> <p> At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-11f25c13-4 bGKxSh\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics.  One common approach is to try and find a company with <em>returns</em> on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing <em>amount</em> of capital employed.  Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return.    With that in mind, the ROCE of <strong>Rockwool</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/dk/capital-goods/cph-rock-b/rockwool-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CPH:ROCK B</a>) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.    </p><h2> Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It? </h2><p> If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business.  The formula for this calculation on Rockwool is: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.21 = €669m ÷ (€3.7b - €561m) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024)</em>.</p><p> Thus, <strong>Rockwool has an ROCE of 21%. </strong> That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 10% earned by companies in a similar industry.   </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/dk/capital-goods/cph-rock-b/rockwool-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Rockwool </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/dk/capital-goods/cph-rock-b/rockwool-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-1 kdwwfs\" height=\"316\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/664372-roce-1-dark/1738665901427\" width=\"333\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">CPSE:ROCK B Return on Capital Employed February 4th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> In the above chart we have measured Rockwool's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.  If you'd like, you can  <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/dk/capital-goods/cph-rock-b/rockwool-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Rockwool </a> for <strong>free.</strong> </p><h2> So How Is Rockwool's ROCE Trending? </h2><p> Rockwool is displaying some positive trends.   Over the last  five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 21%.  The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 44%.  This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.   </p><h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> All in all, it's terrific to see that Rockwool is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base.       Since the stock has returned a solid 57% to shareholders over the last  five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes.   In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Rockwool can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.   </p><p> Before jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price. That's where you can check out our <strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/dk/capital-goods/cph-rock-b/rockwool-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">FREE intrinsic value estimation for ROCK B </a> </strong> that compares the share price and estimated value.   </p><p> If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-balance-sheet-and-fundamentals/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.</a> </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-11f25c13-4 bGKxSh\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Unfortunately for some shareholders, the <strong>Aurora Cannabis Inc.</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/pharmaceuticals-biotech/tsx-acb/aurora-cannabis-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TSE:ACB</a>) share price has dived 26% in the last thirty days, prolonging recent pain.    The recent drop has obliterated the annual return, with the share price now down 4.9% over that longer period.   </p><p> Although its price has dipped substantially, it's still not a stretch to say that Aurora Cannabis' price-to-sales (or \"P/S\") ratio of 0.9x right now seems quite \"middle-of-the-road\" compared to the Pharmaceuticals industry in Canada, where the median P/S ratio is around 0.7x.  However, investors might be overlooking a clear opportunity or potential setback if there is no rational basis for the P/S.    </p> <p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/pharmaceuticals-biotech/tsx-acb/aurora-cannabis-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Aurora Cannabis </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/pharmaceuticals-biotech/tsx-acb/aurora-cannabis-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ps-multiple-vs-industry\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"325\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/272485300-ps-multiple-vs-industry-1-dark/1738665240654\" width=\"820\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TSX:ACB Price to Sales Ratio vs Industry February 4th 2025</figcaption></figure><h3> What Does Aurora Cannabis' P/S Mean For Shareholders? </h3><p> Aurora Cannabis' revenue growth of late has been pretty similar to most other companies.   The P/S ratio is probably moderate because investors think this modest revenue performance will continue.  If this is the case, then at least existing shareholders won't be losing sleep over the current share price.     </p> Keen to find out how analysts think Aurora Cannabis' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/pharmaceuticals-biotech/tsx-acb/aurora-cannabis-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>free </strong>report is a great place to start</a>. <h2> How Is Aurora Cannabis' Revenue Growth Trending?  </h2><p> The only time you'd be comfortable seeing a P/S like Aurora Cannabis' is when the company's growth is tracking the industry closely.  </p><p> Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 13% gain to the company's revenues.   Revenue has also lifted 25% in aggregate from three years ago, partly thanks to the last 12 months of growth.  Accordingly, shareholders would have probably been satisfied with the medium-term rates of revenue growth.   </p> <p> Looking ahead now, revenue is anticipated to climb by 12% per annum during the coming three years according to the six analysts following the company.  That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 8.3% each year growth forecast for the broader industry. </p><p> With this in consideration, we find it intriguing that Aurora Cannabis' P/S is closely matching its industry peers.  It may be that most investors aren't convinced the company can achieve future growth expectations.  </p> <h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> Aurora Cannabis' plummeting stock price has brought its P/S back to a similar region as the rest of the industry.      Using the price-to-sales ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects. </p><p> We've established that Aurora Cannabis currently trades on a lower than expected P/S since its forecasted revenue growth is higher than the wider industry.  When we see a strong revenue outlook, with growth outpacing the industry, we can only assume potential uncertainty around these figures are what might be placing slight pressure on the P/S ratio.  However, if you agree with the analysts' forecasts, you may be able to pick up the stock at an attractive price.     </p><p> Don't forget that there may be other risks. For instance, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/pharmaceuticals-biotech/tsx-acb/aurora-cannabis-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign for Aurora Cannabis</strong> </a> that you should be aware of.  </p><p> If you're <strong>unsure about the strength of Aurora Cannabis' business</strong>, why not explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-business-fundamentals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals</a> for some other companies you may have missed. </p></div>",

We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes.      In this article, we decided to focus on <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/capital-goods/hkg-2338/weichai-power-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Weichai Power's </a> ROE.   </p><p> Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital.  In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/capital-goods/hkg-2338/weichai-power-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Weichai Power </a></span></p><h2> How Do You Calculate Return On Equity? </h2><p> <strong>Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:</strong> </p><p> Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity </p><p>So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Weichai Power is:</p><p>11% = CN¥14b ÷ CN¥121b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).</p><p> The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months.  That means that for every HK$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated HK$0.11 in profit. </p> <h2> What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? </h2><p> So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability.  Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential.  Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. </p><h2> Weichai Power's Earnings Growth And 11% ROE </h2><p> To begin with, Weichai Power seems to have a respectable ROE.   And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 12%.   Given the circumstances, we can't help but wonder why Weichai Power saw little to no growth in the past five years.  Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth.  For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.    </p><p> Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that the industry grew its earnings by 11% over the last few years.   </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/capital-goods/hkg-2338/weichai-power-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"past-earnings-growth\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"334\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/9283092-past-earnings-growth-1-dark/1738649848859\" width=\"821\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">SEHK:2338 Past Earnings Growth February 4th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.   It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline).  Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous.    If you're wondering about Weichai Power's's valuation, check out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/capital-goods/hkg-2338/weichai-power-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio</a>, as compared to its industry.   </p><h2> Is Weichai Power Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits? </h2> <p> Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 46% (implying that the company keeps 54% of its income) over the last three years, Weichai Power has seen a negligible amount of growth in earnings as we saw above.  So there could be some other explanation in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.   </p> <p> Moreover, Weichai Power has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth.      Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 56% over the next three years.   However, Weichai Power's future ROE is expected to rise to 14% despite the expected increase in the company's payout ratio. We infer that there could be other factors that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE.    </p> <h2> Summary  </h2> <p> Overall, we feel that Weichai Power certainly does have some positive factors to consider.      Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business.       Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-11f25c13-4 bGKxSh\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average.  And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost.  To wit, the BANDAI NAMCO Holdings share price has climbed 89% in five years, easily topping the market return of 53% (ignoring dividends).   On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 23%, including dividends.     </p><p> So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-7832/bandai-namco-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for BANDAI NAMCO Holdings </a></span></p> <p> To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...'  One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price. </p> <p> During five years of share price growth, BANDAI NAMCO Holdings achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 15% per year.    This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 14% average annual increase in the share price.   This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal.  In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.  </p><p> The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail). </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-7832/bandai-namco-holdings-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-per-share-growth\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"520\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/409828-earnings-per-share-growth-1-dark/1738635018948\" width=\"821\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TSE:7832 Earnings Per Share Growth February 4th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> It is of course excellent to see how BANDAI NAMCO Holdings has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders.  It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-7832/bandai-namco-holdings-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">report on how its financial position has changed over time</a>. </p> <h2>What About Dividends?</h2><p> It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock.  The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested.  So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return.  As it happens, BANDAI NAMCO Holdings' TSR for the last 5 years was 110%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier.  And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence! </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> It's nice to see that BANDAI NAMCO Holdings shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 23% over the last year.   And that does include the dividend.     That's better than the annualised return of 16% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently.  Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.        I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.   Case in point: We've spotted <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-7832/bandai-namco-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 2 warning signs for BANDAI NAMCO Holdings</strong> </a> you should be aware of, and 1 of them doesn't sit too well with us.    </p><p> Of course, <strong>you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.</strong> So take a peek at this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/19524/growth-stocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of companies we expect will grow earnings.</a> </p><p><em>Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on Japanese exchanges.</em></p></div>",
