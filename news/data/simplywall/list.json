            "description": "<div class=\"sc-11f25c13-4 bGKxSh\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> With its stock down 9.0% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Nichirei (TSE:2871).   But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals.     Specifically, we decided to study <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/food-beverage-tobacco/tse-2871/nichirei-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nichirei's </a> ROE in this article.   </p><p> Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested.  In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/food-beverage-tobacco/tse-2871/nichirei-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Nichirei </a></span></p><h2> How To Calculate Return On Equity? </h2><p> <strong>Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:</strong> </p><p> Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity </p><p>So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Nichirei is:</p><p>10% = JP¥28b ÷ JP¥278b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).</p><p> The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year.  One way to conceptualize this is that for each ¥1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made ¥0.10 in profit. </p> <h2> Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth? </h2><p> So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability.  Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits.  Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. </p><h2> Nichirei's Earnings Growth And 10% ROE </h2><p> At first glance, Nichirei seems to have a decent ROE.   Especially when compared to the industry average of 8.0% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive.   Yet, Nichirei has posted measly growth of 5.0% over the past five years.  This is generally not the case as when a company has a high rate of return it should usually also have a high earnings growth rate.  A few likely reasons why this could happen is that the company could have a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.    </p><p> We then compared Nichirei's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 8.6% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.   </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/food-beverage-tobacco/tse-2871/nichirei-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"past-earnings-growth\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"334\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/876656-past-earnings-growth-1-dark/1738735356607\" width=\"821\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TSE:2871 Past Earnings Growth February 5th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth.  The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in.   This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future.    Is 2871 fairly valued? This<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/food-beverage-tobacco/tse-2871/nichirei-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> infographic on the company's intrinsic value </a> has everything you need to know.   </p><h2> Is Nichirei Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits? </h2> <p> Despite having a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 30% (implying that the company retains the remaining 70% of its income), Nichirei's earnings growth was quite low.  Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.   </p> <p> In addition, Nichirei has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth.   </p> <h2> Summary  </h2> <p> In total, it does look like Nichirei has some positive aspects to its business.      However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth.       Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.     Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/food-beverage-tobacco/tse-2871/nichirei-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Click here to be taken to our analyst's forecasts page for the company.</a> </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-11f25c13-4 bGKxSh\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> T&amp;L (KOSDAQ:340570) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 24% over the last month.   Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes.      Particularly, we will be paying attention to <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/healthcare/kosdaq-a340570/tl-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">T&amp;L's </a> ROE today.   </p><p> Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money.  In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/healthcare/kosdaq-a340570/tl-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for T&amp;L </a></span></p><h2> How Do You Calculate Return On Equity? </h2><p> The <strong>formula for ROE</strong> is: </p><p> Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity </p><p>So, based on the above formula, the ROE for T&amp;L is:</p><p>24% = ₩40b ÷ ₩163b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).</p><p> The 'return' is the yearly profit.  That means that for every ₩1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated ₩0.24 in profit. </p> <h2> What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? </h2><p> Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits.  Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential.  Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes. </p><h2> A Side By Side comparison of T&amp;L's Earnings Growth And 24% ROE </h2><p> First thing first, we like that T&amp;L has an impressive ROE.   Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 8.4% also doesn't go unnoticed by us.   So, the substantial 31% net income growth seen by T&amp;L over the past five years isn't overly surprising.    </p><p> As a next step, we compared T&amp;L's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 19%.   </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/healthcare/kosdaq-a340570/tl-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"past-earnings-growth\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"334\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/84205281-past-earnings-growth-1-dark/1738719936480\" width=\"821\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">KOSDAQ:A340570 Past Earnings Growth February 5th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.   The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in.  By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await.    One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/healthcare/kosdaq-a340570/tl-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">check if T&amp;L is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E</a>, relative to its industry.   </p><h2> Is T&amp;L Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?  </h2> <p> T&amp;L has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 15%, meaning that it has the remaining 85% left over to reinvest into its business.  This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.   </p> <p> Moreover, T&amp;L is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of three years of paying a dividend.      Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 9.8% over the next three years.   Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 29%, over the same period.    </p> <h2> Conclusion  </h2> <p> On the whole, we feel that T&amp;L's performance has been quite good.      Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings.       On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-11f25c13-4 bGKxSh\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business?  Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing <em>amount</em> of capital employed.  Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return.    So when we looked at <strong>Tokyo Ohka Kogyo</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-4186/tokyo-ohka-kogyo-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TSE:4186</a>) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.    </p><h2> Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It? </h2><p> For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business.  Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Tokyo Ohka Kogyo: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.14 = JP¥31b ÷ (JP¥266b - JP¥51b) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024)</em>.</p><p> Therefore, <strong>Tokyo Ohka Kogyo has an ROCE of 14%.</strong> On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 7.2% generated by the Chemicals industry.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-4186/tokyo-ohka-kogyo-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Tokyo Ohka Kogyo </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-4186/tokyo-ohka-kogyo-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-1 kdwwfs\" height=\"316\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/880813-roce-1-dark/1738720330143\" width=\"333\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TSE:4186 Return on Capital Employed February 5th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Above you can see how the current ROCE for Tokyo Ohka Kogyo compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-11f25c13-4 bGKxSh\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues.  Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding <em>base</em> of capital employed.   Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return.    So on that note, <strong>Kinsus Interconnect Technology</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/tw/semiconductors/twse-3189/kinsus-interconnect-technology-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TWSE:3189</a>) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.    </p><h2> Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It? </h2><p> If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business.

Shareholders would no doubt be pleased with this because the business was loss-making  five years ago but is is now generating 3.0% on its capital.  In addition to that, Kinsus Interconnect Technology is employing 113% more capital than previously which is expected of a company that's trying to break into profitability.  This can tell us that the company has plenty of reinvestment opportunities that are able to generate higher returns.   </p><h2> In Conclusion... </h2><p> Long story short, we're delighted to see that Kinsus Interconnect Technology's reinvestment activities have paid off and the company is now profitable.       And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last  five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors.   So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.   </p><p> While Kinsus Interconnect Technology looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price.

However, it's crucial to note that they remain very much invested in the stock and that sale only reduced their holding by 1.1%.    </p> <p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nyse-syk/stryker\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Stryker </a></span></p><h2> The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Stryker </h2> <p> In fact, the recent sale by Independent Director Ronda Stryker was not their only sale of Stryker shares this year.  Earlier in the year, they fetched US$346 per share in a -US$100m sale.     That means that an insider was selling shares at  slightly  below the current price (US$391).  As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation.  Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price.   It is worth noting that this sale was only 1.6% of Ronda Stryker's holding.    </p> <p> Stryker insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company.   Stryker insiders own about US$15b worth of shares (which is 10% of the company).  Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.  </p><h2> What Might The Insider Transactions At Stryker Tell Us? </h2><p> Insiders  sold Stryker shares recently, but they didn't buy any.     And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year.    It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious.      In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Stryker.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-11f25c13-4 bGKxSh\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Rambus Inc. (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-rmbs/rambus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NASDAQ:RMBS</a>), might not be a large cap stock, but it     received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months.   Shareholders may appreciate the recent price jump, but the company still has a way to go before reaching its yearly highs again.     With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price.  However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price?  Today we will analyse the most recent data on Rambus’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-rmbs/rambus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Rambus </a></span></p><h2> What Is Rambus Worth? </h2><p> The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around  5.15% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Rambus today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $57.39,  there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value.    Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Rambus’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.    </p> <h2> What does the future of Rambus look like? </h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-rmbs/rambus/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"524\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/33604-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark/1738680363180\" width=\"821\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NasdaqGS:RMBS Earnings and Revenue Growth February 4th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio.   Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations.    Rambus' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 62%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.   </p> <h2>What This Means For You</h2> <p><strong>Are you a shareholder?</strong> RMBS’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price,  with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as  the financial strength of the company.  Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough  confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value? </p><p><strong>Are you a potential investor?</strong> If you’ve been keeping an eye on RMBS,  now may not be the most  advantageous  time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the  optimistic prospect  is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth  diving deeper into  other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop. </p> <p> If you want to dive deeper into Rambus, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.   For example, we've discovered <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-rmbs/rambus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>2 warning signs</strong></a> that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Rambus.   </p><p> If you are no longer interested in Rambus, you can use our free platform to see our list of over <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/3401/large-cap-high-growth-potential\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">50 other stocks with a high growth potential.</a> </p></div>",

            "title": "Is Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP) Using Too Much Debt?",
            "description": "<div class=\"sc-11f25c13-4 bGKxSh\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.'  It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses.  We can see that <strong>Advance Auto Parts, Inc.</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nyse-aap/advance-auto-parts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NYSE:AAP</a>) does use debt in its business.  But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt? </p><h2> What Risk Does Debt Bring? </h2><p> Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow.   Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers.  However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet.  Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return.  The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. </p> <p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nyse-aap/advance-auto-parts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Advance Auto Parts </a></span></p><h2> What Is Advance Auto Parts's Debt? </h2><p> As you can see below, Advance Auto Parts had US$1.79b of debt, at October 2024, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail.    On the flip side, it has US$464.5m in cash leading to net debt of about US$1.32b.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nyse-aap/advance-auto-parts/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-25294e4c-0 jrFsFO\" height=\"526\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/24333-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark/1738680480781\" width=\"821\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NYSE:AAP Debt to Equity History February 4th 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> A Look At Advance Auto Parts' Liabilities </h2><p> Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Advance Auto Parts had liabilities of US$5.59b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$4.28b due beyond that.    Offsetting this, it had US$464.5m in cash and US$668.9m in receivables that were due within 12 months.   So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$8.74b.   </p><p> This deficit casts a shadow over the US$2.88b company, like a colossus towering over mere mortals.   So we'd watch its balance sheet closely, without a doubt.  After all, Advance Auto Parts would likely require a major re-capitalisation if it had to pay its creditors today.  </p> <p> We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short).  This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it. </p> <p> While Advance Auto Parts's debt to EBITDA ratio (2.9) suggests that it uses some debt, its interest cover is very weak, at 1.7, suggesting high leverage.   In large part that's due to the company's significant depreciation and amortisation charges, which arguably mean its EBITDA is a very generous measure of earnings, and its debt may be more of a burden than it first appears.   It seems clear that the cost of borrowing money is negatively impacting returns for shareholders, of late.        Even worse, Advance Auto Parts saw its EBIT tank 30% over the last 12 months.  If earnings keep going like that over the long term, it has a snowball's chance in hell of paying off that debt.      There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet.  But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Advance Auto Parts's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward.  So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nyse-aap/advance-auto-parts/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this free report on analyst profit forecasts</a> to be interesting.  </p><p> Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it.   So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow.    Looking at the most recent three years, Advance Auto Parts recorded free cash flow of 46% of its EBIT, which is weaker than we'd expect.  That weak cash conversion makes it more difficult to handle indebtedness.   </p> <h2>Our View</h2><p> On the face of it, Advance Auto Parts's EBIT growth rate left us tentative about the stock, and its level of total liabilities was no more enticing than the one empty restaurant on the busiest night of the year.    But at least its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is not so bad.      After considering the datapoints discussed, we think Advance Auto Parts has too much debt.  While some investors love that sort of risky play, it's certainly not our cup of tea.    When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start.  But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.
