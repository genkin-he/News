            "description": "<html><head></head><body><p><strong>Alphabet (</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl/forecast\"><strong>GOOGL</strong></a><strong>)</strong> will be stepping up to the earnings plate tomorrow (February 4), when it will deliver its fourth quarter results after the market action comes to a close. While the shares have delivered market-beating gains of 41% over the past year, heading into the print, the stock looks primed to keep on outperforming.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Maximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:</h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Leverage the power of <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks\">TipRanks' Smart Score</a>, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions. </li><li>Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/smart-portfolio/holdings\"> Your Smart Portfolio</a></li></ul><p></p>\n<p>That at least is the opinion of Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein, who thinks Meta’s recent results bode well for the search giant. </p>\n<p>“META indicated strong advertising trends and recent investor conversations suggest a favorable setup heading into results on search revenue concerns, but expecting higher margins,” the analyst explained. “Additionally, META confirmed Gen <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> is driving ad price growth, which should also benefit GOOG, cementing it as an AI winner.”</p>\n<p>Due to limited 3P data, Helfstein thinks investor expectations for Google are “lowest in mega-cap Internet,” and while the holiday season was strong and the economy is expected to perform well this year, he believes “investor bogey” is lower than the Street’s forecast of 10% revenue growth, although expectations for margins are higher.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, on the pertinent subject of AI, some investors worry that the “cohort dynamics” of younger chatbot users could negatively impact Google in the long run, but there is no evidence of this happening yet. “We believe GOOG is in a better position with AI than many investors had expected 12-18 months ago,” Helfstein went on to say.</p>\n<p>DeepSeek’s recent impact also gets a shout-out here and in a positive way. While the current competition in ranking tables may be between DeepSeek and OpenAI, Helfstein thinks these leads tend to be short-lived as all major models incorporate advancements made by others. Bears might argue that declining costs will commoditize search, but Helfstein believes this view overlooks Google’s years of developing practical products and its “best in class” data.</p>\n<p>Turning to the numbers, Helfstein forecasts Q4 growth for Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) at +12%/+10%/+32% year-over-year, compared to the Street’s expectations of +11%/+11%/+32%. The analyst projects GAAP EPS at $2.22, ahead of the consensus estimate of $2.12.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to Q1, Helfstein anticipates Search/YouTube/GCP revenue growth of +8%/+10%/+25% y/y, whereas Wall Street is modeling +9%/+9%/+30%. On GAAP EPS, he expects $1.98 versus the Street’s $2.03 forecast.</p>\n<p>With an attractive Q4 setup in play, Helfstein has upped his price target from $215 to $225, implying a ~12% upside from current levels. He remains bullish on GOOGL, maintaining an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating. (To watch Helfstein’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/jason-helfstein\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Other Wall Street analysts are similarly optimistic. Out of 29 recent GOOGL ratings, 21 are Buys and 8 are Holds, leading to a Strong Buy consensus. Going by the $219.60 average target, a year from now, shares will be changing hands for a ~9% premium.

Service revenue reached $26.34 billion, edging past the $26.1 billion consensus estimate, while Mac and iPad sales also outperformed, generating $8.99 billion and $8.09 billion, respectively – both above analyst projections of $7.94 billion and $7.35 billion.</p>\n<p>However, iPhone sales in China fell 11% to ~$18 billion, contributing to total iPhone revenue of $69.14 billion – short of the $71.04 billion forecast. Even so, Apple delivered a record EPS of $2.40, topping expectations by $0.06.</p>\n<p>On the earnings call, CEO Tim Cook struck an optimistic tone, noting that the iPhone 16 cycle is already outperforming the iPhone 15. The company also saw a record number of iPhone upgrades in the December quarter. Apple closed out FY24 with an active installed base of 2.35 billion devices, reflecting an impressive 7% y/y growth and the addition of approximately 150 million net new devices to its ecosystem over the past year.</p>\n<p>That expanding ecosystem is precisely what has Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives excited: “Herein lies the golden installed base that is at the epicenter of our bull thesis and why we believe ~25% of the world will ultimately access <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> through an Apple device.”</p>\n<p>Apple also provided “important granular data” regarding the impact of Apple Intelligence-driven demand. In markets where Apple Intelligence was already available (such as the U.S.), y/y performance outpaced regions where the AI rollout has yet to take place, which bodes well for the next few quarters.</p>\n<p>“With the anticipated April rollout of Apple Intelligence in China (Chinese partner likely Baidu or Tencent), India, and other markets the strength of this iPhone 16 cycle will be more back end loaded in the March and June quarters,” Ives added.</p>\n<p>A key takeaway for Ives is that Apple is now at the start of a “multi-year upgrade cycle” from iPhone 16 to iPhone 17 with the Apple bears about to beat a hasty retreat. </p>\n<p>“The Nvidia AI Revolution essentially happened overnight….Apple’s AI Consumer Revolution will happen over the course of 12-18 months and with almost 2.4 billion iOS devices including 1.5 billion iPhones this speaks to our firm bullish thesis on Cupertino and Cook &amp; Co. over the next year,” Ives summed up.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, Ives rates AAPL shares an Outperform (i.e., Buy) with a Street-high $325 price target. (To watch Ives’ track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/daniel-ives\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>The broader Wall Street view is more conservative, with an average target of $251.60, pointing to a ~10% upside over the next year. Overall, the stock earns a Moderate Buy consensus, based on 18 Buys, 10 Holds, and 4 Sells.

Lee said that while BTC could continue to weaken in the near-term, its long-term prospects continue to look positive.
