Revenue climbed by 36% year-over-year to reach $827.52 million, $46.28 million above the Street’s call. That figure included a 64% y/y jump in U.S. commercial revenue, which reached $214 million, while U.S. government revenue increased by 45% to $343 million.</p>\n<p>Amongst other strong metrics, the company completed 129 deals worth at least $1 million, 58 deals valued at $5 million or more, and 32 deals exceeding $10 million. Palantir also achieved a record-breaking $803 million in U.S. commercial TCV (total contract value), representing a 134% y/y increase. At the bottom line, adj. EPS of $0.14 beat the forecast by $0.03.</p>\n<p>And the momentum isn’t slowing. Palantir’s Q1 guidance came in well above expectations, with projected revenue between $858 million and $862 million, easily outpacing the Street’s $799.36 million estimate.</p>\n<p>For those still thinking Palantir’s 2024 performance will be hard to replicate, Bank of America analyst Mariana Perez Mora says last year was “only a dress rehearsal.”</p>\n<p>“The company sees the world ripe for an <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> and technology revolution. We see PLTR enabling and leading this revolution in both Commercial and Defense markets,” the 5-star analyst went on to say.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, Perez Mora sees another avenue where Palantir can make further headway. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) presents a significant opportunity for “government efficiency enablers,” with Perez Mora seeing Palantir as an “enabler of efficiency and clear winner.” If DOGE initiates an era of commercial-style contracting, digital-first development, and open, agnostic architecture needs, Palantir’s portfolio and “approach to government contracts is already in line.”</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, Perez Mora sees Palantir as a different kind of beast to other names operating the space, noting: “With the AI market becoming more crowded with more commoditized solutions; we think Palantir’s value proposition is only becoming more pronounced.”</p>\n<p>Moreover, the analyst anticipates greater market value will be assigned to the “AI value-adders vs. commodity distributors,” believing Palantir belongs squarely in the former club.</p>\n<p>Perez Mora didn’t just take notice – she took action. The analyst hiked her price target on PLTR to a Street-high of $125, indicating a potential upside of ~20% over the next year. It goes without saying, but Perez Mora’s rating remains a Buy. (To watch Perez Mora’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/mariana-perez-mora\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Most on the Street, however, think the stock has soared too much for now; the average price target stands at $78.67, a figure that sits 24% below the current share price. On the rating front, based on a mix of 11 Holds, 5 Sells and 2 Buys, the analyst consensus rates the stock a Hold (i.e., Neutral).

As the dominant player in <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> chips, Nvidia now faces the question of whether this shift could reshape demand for its high-performance hardware.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Maximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:</h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Leverage the power of <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks\">TipRanks' Smart Score</a>, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions. </li><li>Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/smart-portfolio/holdings\"> Your Smart Portfolio</a></li></ul><p></p>\n<p>That’s not the only storm cloud on the horizon. The looming threat of a global trade war, with proposed 100% tariffs on imported semiconductors, adds another layer of uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Some investors aren’t waiting to see how it all plays out – Nvidia’s stock has already tumbled 19% over the past week and a half as concerns take hold.</p>\n<p>Though acknowledging this “double whammy” brought on by DeepSeek and potential trade disruptions, top investor James Foord – who sits in the top 4% of TipRanks’ stock pros – spots an opportunity.</p>\n<p>“Buying Nvidia around $90-$100 ahead of Q4 earnings is a strategic move,” notes the 5-star investor.</p>\n<p>Foord is nonplussed by the DeepSeek and tariff worries, believing these risks are not as stark as some fear.</p>\n<p>When it comes to DeepSeek, the investor cites the Jevons paradox for assurances that the demand for AI hardware will remain hale and hearty. According to Jevons, Foord explains, when a resource becomes cheaper it also becomes more widely used.</p>\n<p>“Now that AI applications are actually affordable, there are potentially millions of companies and users that will be interested in deploying large language models, or LLMs, and this is still very good for Nvidia,” the investor explains.</p>\n<p>As for the tariff turmoil, Foord believes Nvidia’s pricing power will enable it to pass higher costs onto customers, safeguarding its margins in the process.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Foord is not overly concerned that Nvidia’s primacy is at risk, citing the company’s industry-leading CUDA software and the stalwart leadership of Jensen Huang and his leadership cadre.</p>\n<p>“This is still the same group of people that achieved over 90% dominance in GPUs thanks to superior vision and execution, and I believe we’ll continue to see this in the years to come,” concludes Foord.</p>\n<p>To this end, the investor rates NVDA a Strong Buy, hoping to gobble up shares around $100. (To watch Foord’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/bloggers/james-foord\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Wall Street echoes his bullish stance. With 37 Buys and just 3 Holds, NVDA boasts a Strong Buy consensus. Its 12-month average price target of $179.81 implies a potential 51% upside in the year ahead.

The main cause of this jump was a steep increase in Instinct GPU shipments, along with strong growth in AMD EPYC CPU sales. </p>\n<p>However, its Gaming segment saw a 59% year-over-year decrease to $563 million. This was due to a reduction in semi-custom revenue, which involves designing and manufacturing customized chips tailored to the specific needs of individual customers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Guidance for Q1 2025</strong></h2>\n<p>Looking forward, management has provided the following guidance for Q1 2025:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue of between $6.8 billion and $7.4 billion versus analysts’ estimate of $6.99 billion</li>\n<li>Non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 54%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As we can see, the company’s revenue outlook at the midpoint of $7.1 billion was better than analysts’ expectations. It also slightly beat on EPS and comfortably exceeded revenue estimates. So, why is the stock down? It could be because the stock rallied 4.6% in today’s trading ahead of the earnings release, and investors decided to take a profit.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is AMD a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on AMD stock based on 15 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below.
