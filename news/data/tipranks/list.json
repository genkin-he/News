He also reiterated that he feels the market’s worries about DeepSeek’s <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> chatbot have been an overreaction that will soon pass. </p>\n<p>In addition to being constructive on stocks, Lee remains bullish on cryptocurrencies, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/bitcoin-btc-rebounds-to-100000-as-tariff-threat-eases\">particularly Bitcoin</a>. Lee said that while BTC could continue to weaken in the near-term, its long-term prospects continue to look positive. In January of this year, Lee forecast that Bitcoin’s price will <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd/technical-analysis\">rise to $250,000</a> by the end of 2025.</p>\n<p>Lastly, Lee said that January was a positive month for the stock market, and that whenever markets rise in the first month, there’s an 89% win-ratio for the year, with a median gain of 19%. Lee encourages investors to look for bargain stocks among small-caps, financials, and industrials.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is BTC a Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Most Wall Street firms don’t offer ratings or price targets on Bitcoin, so we’ll look at the cryptocurrency’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd\">three-month performance&nbsp;</a>instead.

I have also signed a new intelligence directive on organized crime and fentanyl and we will be backing it with $200 million.”</p>\n<p>Trudeau’s pledge follows a similar one earlier in the day by <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/spx-ndx-djia-markets-recover-as-trump-pauses-tariffs-on-mexico\">the Mexican government</a>, which announced that it is deploying 10,000 troops to help fortify the U.S. border.
