The union estimates the total number of jobs impacted by Amazon’s warehouse closures at 4,500 when subcontractors are included. </p>\n<p>Amazon announced in January of this year that it would <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amazon-nasdaqamzn-closes-more-physical-stores\">phase out seven sites </a>in Quebec “following a recent review” of its operations in the province. The union contends that Amazon made the decision to pullout of Quebec after Amazon employees in the region voted to unionize. The e-commerce company said it plans to return to a third-party delivery model to handle packages in that part of Canada.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Union Battles</strong></h2>\n<p>“What it calls the ‘new business model’ is just an attempt to circumvent its obligations under the Labour Code. The court should recognize that this scheme violates the law and it can then order the reinstatement of Amazon’s workers,” said CSN president Caroline Senneville in a written statement. </p>\n<p>Canada isn’t the only place where Amazon faces growing labor pressures. In the U.S., workers at an Amazon warehouse in North Carolina are slated to vote next week on whether to join a union. Amazon employees at a warehouse in Staten Island, New York, formed the company’s first union in 2022, joining the Teamsters. They have yet to secure a contract from the company.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn\">AMZN stock has risen 42%</a> in the last 12 months.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is AMZN Stock a Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>The stock of Amazon has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 41 Wall Street analysts.

Apple’s Services division has become the company’s second largest business behind the iPhone, reporting $25 billion in sales in the December quarter.</p>\n<p>Services has also become a big source of Apple’s profit, with a gross margin of 74%. The growth of Apple’s services division is helping Apple’s overall margins expand in recent quarters after years of staying flat. Apple’s services business also includes its search deal with Google, Apple Pay payments and device warranties.</p>\n<p>With Invites, Apple is taking on Partiful, a startup founded in 2020 that allows users to make and send event invites. Partiful did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but it posted on social media a joke about Apple’s app being a copycat.</p>\n<p>An iCloud+ subscription starts at $1 per month for 50GB of storage, and it’s included in Apple’s other subscription bundles, ranging up to a $38-per-month subscription that also includes the company’s TV service, Apple Music and access to games, fitness classes and news.</p>\n<p>Invites also includes Apple Intelligence, the company’s suite of <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a> software. Apple Intelligence can generate images for invites and help write the invitation with the company’s Writing Tools. Apple Intelligence also has the ability to share a photo album or playlist with an event’s guest list.</p>\n<p>While Apple doesn’t charge individually for many of its iCloud+ services, it now has a host of paid features intended to get users to upgrade from free storage. That subscription service offers a VPN-style relay service for private browsing, custom email domains for iCloud, local security camera storage and the ability to generate burner emails.</p>\n<p>Apple doesn’t disclose how many iCloud+ subscribers it has. The company last week said that it has 1 billion subscribers, but that figure includes subscriptions to apps through the App Store in addition to its direct iCloud subscriptions.</p>\n</body></html>",

Arya reiterated Nvidia as his top pick for 2025, with a price target of $190 per share, which equates to an upside of more than 61% at the time of writing.

However, Arya views the decline as an opportunity and noted that Nvidia’s valuation has become more attractive.

The company has already spent $80 billion on the virtual reality and augmented reality technologies needed to develop smart glasses since the company first entered the space in 2014. Now, the company’s investment in VR and AR smart glasses is set to surpass $100 billion. </p>\n<p>Meta is reportedly planning to <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/meta-earnings-meta-platforms-financial-results-top-wall-street-forecasts\">invest $19.9 billion</a> in its Reality Labs unit that is responsible for making the company’s Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. On the company’s recent earnings call with analysts and media, Zuckerberg referred to the glasses as a “real hit,” along with its Quest VR headsets. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>One Million Sales </strong></h2>\n<p>Although <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/meta-platforms-price-target-raised-to-775-from-686-at-argus\">Meta doesn’t breakout sales</a> of its smart glasses, <em>The Financial Times</em> has reported that the company sold one million sets of the VR Ray-Bans in 2024 alone. With sales accelerating, Meta plans to pour an additional $20 billion into the Reality Labs unit this year as it develops next generation Ray-Ban smart glasses. The glasses are produced in partnership with EssilorLuxottica, Ray-Ban’s parent company.</p>\n<p>Some analysts have questioned the amount of money Meta continues to throw at Reality Labs given that the business unit had sales of only $2.1 billion last year. Operating losses at Reality Labs reached a record high of $17.7 billion during 2024 as the unit continues to work on cutting edge though unproven technologies.</p>\n<p>They are equipped with tiny cameras, microphones, and speakers to allow the user to take pictures, chat with an <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> assistant, or listen to music.

Unsurprisingly, the company plans to use this funding to support its Bitcoin-buying strategy. In addition, MicroStrategy’s ability to raise capital through this method shows that the market is interested in this asset class. In fact, the firm may raise up to $2 billion this quarter using this method.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that the preferred stock units offer a quarterly dividend and have a cumulative feature, which means that missed payouts will eventually be made. Furthermore, the conversion price is set at $1,000, which is roughly 200% above the latest closing price.

CEO Ramon Laguarta told <em>Yahoo Finance</em> that the company is “not immune” to the impact of tariffs, although it’s less affected than most other businesses. In fact, the company sources aluminum and oats from Canada, but most of its food inputs are localized, which provides it with some flexibility to handle these challenges.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Maximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:</h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Leverage the power of <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks\">TipRanks' Smart Score</a>, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions. </li><li>Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/smart-portfolio/holdings\"> Your Smart Portfolio</a></li></ul><p></p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the recent tariffs imposed by President <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> on Mexico, Canada, and China have created uncertainty. While the tariffs on Mexico and Canada were temporarily delayed, PepsiCo’s shares are still down in today’s trading due to the company’s <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/pep-earnings-pepsi-stock-loses-fizz-on-mixed-q4-results\">muted growth outlook for 2025</a>. Indeed, Laguarta emphasized the need for conservative guidance thanks to the ongoing geopolitical tensions and higher costs of doing business.</p>\n<p>As a result, analysts are concerned about the company’s growth prospects, with Evercore analyst Robert Ottenstein noting that maintaining a 20x multiple will be challenging without some growth in the U.S. Although Wall Street still has a relatively optimistic view of PepsiCo’s business, investors should be prepared for potential cuts to ratings and price targets.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is PEP Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, the&nbsp;analysts’ consensus rating for PepsiCo is Moderate Buy&nbsp;based on four Buys and six Holds assigned during the past three months. With that comes an <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pep/forecast\">average PEP stock price target</a> of $167.90 per share, which equates to 16.6% upside potential from current levels.

The update on Exxon Mobil’s stock comes after the oil and natural gas producer recently reported its fourth-quarter <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/company-announcements/exxonmobil-reports-strong-2024-financial-performance\">financial results</a>. </p>\n<p>Mehta said that the main reason for the lowered price target relates to valuation expectations for the stock, as well as a reduced earnings outlook. Goldman Sachs now forecasts that Exxon Mobil will post earnings per share (EPS) of $7.49 in 2025 and $9.41 in 2026, down from $8.17 and $9.97 previously. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Uncertain Oil Market</strong> </h2>\n<p>Goldman Sachs also noted an <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/chevron-exxon-nyse-xom-steady-as-opec-sticks-to-oil-plan-amid-volatile-session-for-crude\">uncertain outlook</a> for crude oil demand this year due to slowing economic growth in China and new regulations and policies in the U.S. under President Donald Trump. “Key risks relate to commodity prices, refining margins, and operational execution,” wrote Mehta in the report.</p>\n<p>Oil prices have been jostled in recent weeks following Trump’s inauguration as the new administration takes steps to promote greater oil production but also threatens tariffs on major trade partners such as China.
