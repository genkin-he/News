The tech giants’ massive investments in <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> have been questioned after Chinese startup DeepSeek achieved AI breakthroughs at a much lower cost. Despite this, analysts believe that Amazon is well-positioned to capitalize on cheaper AI due to its massive cloud business and lower exposure to costly large-language models.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Maximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:</h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Leverage the power of <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks\">TipRanks' Smart Score</a>, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions. </li><li>Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/smart-portfolio/holdings\"> Your Smart Portfolio</a></li></ul><p></p>\n<p>Interestingly, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is expected to post its strongest revenue increase in eight quarters, with a 19.3% growth rate. In addition, some experts believe that AWS may have caught up in the AI race. This could mean that it has regained market share, which may lead to a less severe deceleration in growth compared to its rivals.</p>\n<p>Separately, Amazon’s retail business is also expected to benefit from a healthy holiday shopping season as North American sales are projected to rise 9% year-over-year. This estimate is based on the company’s efforts to improve its delivery times, expand product merchandise, and focus on grocery, pharmacy, and fashion. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Amazon Stock Expected to Rise?</strong></h2>\n<p>Overall, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on AMZN stock based on 39 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below.

However, the company has now moved to a “general release” of the powerful <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> model.</p>\n<p>The AI model includes 2.0 Flash, which is being promoted as a “workhorse model, optimal for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale.” The Gemini 2.0 model also includes the ability to use AI for coding. The technology giant is calling the new AI its “most cost-efficient model yet.”</p>\n<p>Gemini Flash costs developers 10 cents per million tokens for text, image and video inputs, while Flash-Lite, its more cost-effective version, costs .75 of a cent for the same.</p>\n<p>The continued releases are part of a broader strategy for Google of investing heavily into “AI agents” as the AI arms race heats up among tech giants and startups alike.</p>\n<p>Meta<br>, Amazon, Microsoft<br>, OpenAI and Anthropic are also moving toward agentic AI, or models that can complete complex multi-step tasks on a user’s behalf, rather than a user having to walk them through every individual step.</p>\n<p>“Over the last year, we have been investing in developing more agentic models, meaning they can understand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead, and take action on your behalf, with your supervision,” Google wrote in a December blog post, adding that Gemini 2.0 has “new advances in multimodality — like native image and audio output — and native tool use,” and that the family of models “will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant.”</p>\n<p>Anthropic, the Amazon-backed AI startup founded by ex-OpenAI research executives, is a key competitor in the race to develop AI agents. In October, the startup said that its AI agents were able to use computers like humans to complete complex tasks. Anthropic’s computer use capability allows its technology to interpret what’s on a computer screen, select buttons, enter text, navigate websites and execute tasks through any software and real-time internet browsing, the startup said.</p>\n<p>The tool can “use computers in basically the same way that we do,” Jared Kaplan, Anthropic’s chief science officer, told CNBC in an interview at the time. He said it can do tasks with “tens or even hundreds of steps.”</p>\n<p>OpenAI released a similar tool recently, introducing a feature called Operator that will automate tasks such as planning vacations, filling out forms, making restaurant reservations and ordering groceries. The Microsoft-backed startup described Operator as “an agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you.”</p>\n<p>Earlier this week, OpenAI announced another tool called Deep Research that allows an AI agent to compile complex research reports and analyze questions and topics of the user’s choice. Google in December launched a similar tool of the same name — Deep Research — which acts as a “research assistant, exploring complex topics and compiling reports on your behalf.”</p>\n<p>CNBC first reported in December that Google would introduce several AI features early in 2025.</p>\n<p>“In history, you don’t always need to be first but you have to execute well and really be the best in class as a product,” CEO Sundar Pichai said in a strategy meeting at the time. “I think that’s what 2025 is all about.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is GOOGL Stock a Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>The stock of Alphabet has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 29 Wall Street analysts.

The analyst called Palantir the “Messi of AI Story” and lifted the price target to $120 from $90, while keeping a Buy rating.

Palantir stock also hit an all-time high of $106.91 on Tuesday, pushing its market capitalization to over $200 billion.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ives’ Views on Palantir’s Growth Potential</strong></h2>\n<p>Ives was impressed by Palantir’s fourth-quarter results and guidance, leading him to revise his model estimates for Fiscal 2025. The analyst noted that Palantir is one of the transformational tech stories that occur every decade and change the operational landscape. He was encouraged by the 43% year-over-year growth in customer count. Ives also noted that in Q4, the company secured 129 deals that were at least $1 million in value and 58 deals worth at least $5 million. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additionally, Ives believes that Palantir is spurring the AI revolution with its AIP (<a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a> platform) product moat, which remains matchless. Interestingly, Ives stated that PLTR is playing chess, while the remaining AI companies are playing checkers.</p>\n<p>Also, he feels that Palantir bears have missed the opportunity to dive into one of the generational tech stories since they cannot relate to AI, nor can they relate to Palantir’s high valuation. Ives also goes on to state that buying Palantir today is like buying Tesla <a data-ticker=\"TSLA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla\">(TSLA)</a> in 2015, and bears are clearly missing on this growth story.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>CEO Karp Says Palantir Still in Early Stages</strong></h2>\n<p>Palantir CEO <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/insiders/alexander-c.-karp\">Alex Karp</a> also shares the same views as Ives. In the Letter to Shareholders, Karp noted that PLTR is still in the early stages of the AI revolution and is yet to bear the massive fruits of its labor. Karp highlighted that the company is witnessing equal traction in both its commercial and government segments.</p>\n<p>In Q4 2024, sales from the PLTR’s U.S. commercial segment jumped 64% year-over-year. At the same time, sales from the U.S. government segment rose 45% compared to the prior-year quarter.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pltr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"937\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-142.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1708073\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-142.png 937w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-142-300x173.png 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-142-768x443.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 937px) 100vw, 937px\"></a></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Palantir Stock a Good Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Not all analysts share the same enthusiasm for Palantir stock as Ives.

Although Temu’s efforts in ramping up its U.S. warehouses and semi-managed model over the past year could help mitigate some of the tariff risks, they estimate the gross merchandise volume from local warehouses may have only accounted for about a fifth of U.S. sales last year.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>De Minimis Helped PDD&nbsp;</strong>Undercut U.S. Firms</h2>\n<p>Trump’s clampdown is not out of the blue. The Biden administration last year started to take steps to curb what it called the “overuse and abuse” of de minimis, saying it unfairly helped Chinese e-commerce companies undercut competitors with lower prices.&nbsp;Officials have also raised concerns about safety as the shipments are&nbsp;“subject to minimal documentation and inspection.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The volume of these shipments has skyrocketed from 139 million a year in 2015 to over 1.36 billion in 2024,&nbsp;with more than half of these originating in China. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ironically, the cost limit was increased from $200 to $800 in 2016 after lobbying by U.S. online retailers including eBay <a data-ticker=\"EBAY\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ebay\">(EBAY)</a> and Etsy <a data-ticker=\"ETSY\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/etsy\">(ETSY)</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This in turn helped fuel aggressive growth by China’s ecommerce companies in the U.S. market, which has put pressure on the likes of AMZN to counter. In response to this competition, the company in November&nbsp;launched a new outlet called Haul&nbsp;which caps the price of products on sale at $20.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But the closing of the loophole means shipments from China will be subject to existing tariffs plus the additional 10% tariff. Inspections at ports will also require longer shipping times and incur higher non-tariff costs.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is PDD a Good Stock to Buy?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>Overall, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, though none has updated price targets since last year. Analysts with a three-month price target are split along the lines of six Buys, four Holds and one Sell.

Speaking at a Capitol Hill press conference on Tuesday, Sacks unveiled ambitious plans for U.S. crypto dominance, flanked by lawmakers from both the House and Senate.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Maximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:</h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Leverage the power of <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks\">TipRanks' Smart Score</a>, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions. </li><li>Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/smart-portfolio/holdings\"> Your Smart Portfolio</a></li></ul><p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Crypto Legislation Hits the Fast Lane</strong></h2>\n<p>Sacks made it clear that <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/trumps-crypto-czar-david-sacks-aims-to-redefine-digital-assets\">crypto is a top priority for the </a><a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> administration. “I look forward to creating a golden age in digital assets,” he stated. To get the ball rolling, Congress will establish a bicameral working group to hammer out digital asset regulations. According to <em>CoinDesk</em>, this initiative includes advancing stablecoin oversight and updating market structure rules.</p>\n<p>The move is all about keeping innovation on U.S. soil. Sacks emphasized that “financial assets are destined to become digital,” and the U.S. wants to stay at the forefront of this transition.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Stablecoins First in Line</strong></h2>\n<p>The Senate Banking Committee, chaired by Tim Scott, will tackle stablecoin legislation as an immediate priority. Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty introduced a bill that divides oversight between state agencies and federal regulators, such as the Federal Reserve. The goal? Strike a balance between fostering innovation and ensuring accountability.</p>\n<p>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, House Financial Services Chair French Hill said a stablecoin bill would work alongside a revamped version of last year’s Financial Innovation and Technology Act (FIT21), which aims to modernize U.S. market regulations for digital assets.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What This Means for Investors</strong></h2>\n<p>This development could mean a more stable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, potentially encouraging more institutional investment. Sacks’ push for innovation-friendly policies signals that the U.S. is serious about competing with crypto powerhouses like Switzerland and Singapore.</p>\n<p>With lawmakers rallying behind pro-crypto legislation, the U.S. digital asset landscape could see major shifts in the coming months.
