It has large government contracts, particularly with the Department of Defense and intelligence services.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>DOGE would be “very good for Palantir,” which derives about two-thirds of its U.S. revenues from government contracts, Karp told analysts on the earnings call last night.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Disruption, at the end of the day, exposes things that aren’t working,” he said. “There will be ups and downs.

Earnings per share came in at $0.14 versus the $0.11 expected on revenues of $828 million vs. $776 million expected.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>U.S. revenue for the quarter rose 52% year-over-year, while overall revenue growth stood at 36%. Palantir said its U.S. government revenue for Fiscal year 2024 grew 30% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, with growth accelerating to 45% in this segment in Q4. U.S. commercial revenue in the fourth quarter grew 64% year-over-year and 20% quarter-over-quarter to $214 million.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We are still in the earliest stages, the beginning of the first act, of a revolution that will play out over years and decades,” Karp told shareholders in a letter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shares of PLTR surged in after-hours trading following the earnings update and extended gains in the pre-market, with the stock up 23%.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is PLTR a Good Stock to Buy?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>After a 400% rally in the shares, analysts have a consensus Hold rating on PLTR stock, based on two Buy, 10 Hold and five Sell ratings.

Spotify, which recently struck a multi-year licensing deal with Universal Music Group <a data-ticker=\"UMGNF\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/umgnf\">(UMGNF)</a>, also launched an audio-books only plan and music-only plan, which has enabled it to raise prices twice in a year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In turn this helped the company to deliver record gross margins, which climbed 555bps to 32.2% and a record high operating income of €477 million, or $493 million. This drove Spotify’s first full year of operating profit to €1.4 billion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I am very excited about 2025 and feel really good about where we are as both a product and as a business,”&nbsp;said&nbsp;Daniel Ek, Spotify Founder &amp; CEO.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is SPOT a Good Stock to Buy?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>After a <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/spot\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/spot\">145% rally</a> for SPOT in the last 12 months, analysts on Wall Street are bullish.

The firm expects PayPal’s transaction margins to improve, even if growth is not steady.

Rawat points out challenges, including competition from services like Apple Pay and concerns about Braintree’s pricing approach. She also highlights tax rate uncertainties from international policy changes and lower <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators\">interest rates</a> affecting PYPL’s gross profit growth.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Options Traders Anticipate a Large Move</strong></h2>\n<p>Using TipRanks’ Options tool, we can see what options traders are expecting from the stock immediately after its earnings report.
