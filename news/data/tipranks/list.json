CEO Ramon Laguarta told <em>Yahoo Finance</em> that the company is “not immune” to the impact of tariffs, although it’s less affected than most other businesses. In fact, the company sources aluminum and oats from Canada, but most of its food inputs are localized, which provides it with some flexibility to handle these challenges.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Maximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:</h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Leverage the power of <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks\">TipRanks' Smart Score</a>, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions. </li><li>Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/smart-portfolio/holdings\"> Your Smart Portfolio</a></li></ul><p></p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the recent tariffs imposed by President <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> on Mexico, Canada, and China have created uncertainty. While the tariffs on Mexico and Canada were temporarily delayed, PepsiCo’s shares are still down in today’s trading due to the company’s <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/pep-earnings-pepsi-stock-loses-fizz-on-mixed-q4-results\">muted growth outlook for 2025</a>. Indeed, Laguarta emphasized the need for conservative guidance thanks to the ongoing geopolitical tensions and higher costs of doing business.</p>\n<p>As a result, analysts are concerned about the company’s growth prospects, with Evercore analyst Robert Ottenstein noting that maintaining a 20x multiple will be challenging without some growth in the U.S. Although Wall Street still has a relatively optimistic view of PepsiCo’s business, investors should be prepared for potential cuts to ratings and price targets.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is PEP Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, the&nbsp;analysts’ consensus rating for PepsiCo is Moderate Buy&nbsp;based on four Buys and six Holds assigned during the past three months. With that comes an <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pep/forecast\">average PEP stock price target</a> of $167.90 per share, which equates to 16.6% upside potential from current levels. However, these ratings and price targets will likely change as analysts update their coverage after <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pep/earnings\">this morning’s earnings report</a>.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pep/forecast\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"765\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-108-1024x765.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1705914\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-108-1024x765.png 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-108-300x224.png 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-108-768x574.png 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-108-105x77.png 105w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-108.png 1452w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pep/forecast\">See more PEP stock analyst ratings</a></strong></p>\n</body></html>",

This program aims to set Travala apart from traditional booking sites that rely on old-school loyalty points.</p>\n<p>Travala’s expansion highlights the growing role of blockchain in real-world applications.

It has large government contracts, particularly with the Department of Defense and intelligence services.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>DOGE would be “very good for Palantir,” which derives about two-thirds of its U.S. revenues from government contracts, Karp told analysts on the earnings call last night.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Disruption, at the end of the day, exposes things that aren’t working,” he said. “There will be ups and downs. There’s a revolution. Some people are going to get their heads cut off. We’re expecting to see really unexpected things and to win.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>PLTR Earnings Rise&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>The comments from Karp followed a handsome beat for PLTR earnings in its Fiscal fourth quarter. Earnings per share came in at $0.14 versus the $0.11 expected on revenues of $828 million vs. $776 million expected.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>U.S. revenue for the quarter rose 52% year-over-year, while overall revenue growth stood at 36%. Palantir said its U.S. government revenue for Fiscal year 2024 grew 30% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, with growth accelerating to 45% in this segment in Q4. U.S. commercial revenue in the fourth quarter grew 64% year-over-year and 20% quarter-over-quarter to $214 million.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We are still in the earliest stages, the beginning of the first act, of a revolution that will play out over years and decades,” Karp told shareholders in a letter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shares of PLTR surged in after-hours trading following the earnings update and extended gains in the pre-market, with the stock up 23%.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is PLTR a Good Stock to Buy?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>After a 400% rally in the shares, analysts have a consensus Hold rating on PLTR stock, based on two Buy, 10 Hold and five Sell ratings.

Total payment volume increased 7% to $437.8 billion, while transaction margin dollars rose 7% to $3.9 billion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We set out at the beginning of 2024 to narrow our focus, improve execution, and reposition the business,” commented President and CEO Alex Chriss. “One year later, I’m proud that we’ve laid a strong foundation for long-term, profitable growth across the company’s most important areas.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He referenced improvements in the Branded Checkout, peer-to-peer payments and bill-splitting mobile payments app Venmo.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, there are concerns about Branded Checkout, which is a way to cutomize PayPal’s checkout page to match a business’s branding.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mizuho analyst <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/dan-dolev\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/dan-dolev\">Dan Dolev</a>, who rates PayPal&nbsp;a Buy with a price target of $100, suggested weakness in this area, with branded growth of 6% coming in short of expectations, could be to blame for the stock decline.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He told <em>Barron’s</em> that that “the health of the Branded Checkout button is the heart of the debate around the future of PYPL.”&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>PYPL’s Fiscal 2025 Outlook&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>In addition to announcing a $15 billion stock buyback program, PYPL offered clues to its current Fiscal year 2025. The company anticipates adjusted earnings per share (EPS) between $4.95 and $5.10, slightly ahead of the $4.90 expected by analysts. For the first quarter it expects EPS of $1.15-$1.17, versus the consensus $1.13 pencilled in by analysts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Is PYPL Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on PayPal stock based on eleven Buys and ten Holds assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below.
