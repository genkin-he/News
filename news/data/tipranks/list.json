            "description": "<html><head></head><body><p>Shares of Advanced Micro Devices <a data-ticker=\"AMD\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd\">(AMD)</a> are down in after-hours trading after the chipmaker reported Q4 earnings results. Earnings per share came in at $1.09, which slightly beat <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/earnings\">analysts’ consensus estimate</a> of $1.08. In addition, sales increased by 24.2% year-over-year, with revenue hitting $7.7 billion.

The main cause of this jump was a steep increase in Instinct GPU shipments, along with strong growth in AMD EPYC CPU sales. </p>\n<p>However, its Gaming segment saw a 59% year-over-year decrease to $563 million. This was due to a reduction in semi-custom revenue, which involves designing and manufacturing customized chips tailored to the specific needs of individual customers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Guidance for Q1 2025</strong></h2>\n<p>Looking forward, management has provided the following guidance for Q1 2025:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue of between $6.8 billion and $7.4 billion versus analysts’ estimate of $6.99 billion</li>\n<li>Non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 54%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As we can see, the company’s revenue outlook at the midpoint of $7.1 billion was better than analysts’ expectations. It also slightly beat on EPS and comfortably exceeded revenue estimates. So, why is the stock down? It could be because the stock rallied 4.6% in today’s trading ahead of the earnings release, and investors decided to take a profit.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is AMD a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on AMD stock based on 15 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd\">a 31% rally in its share price</a> over the past year, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast\">average AMD price target</a> of $159.91 per share implies 33.7% upside potential.

The union estimates the total number of jobs impacted by Amazon’s warehouse closures at 4,500 when subcontractors are included. </p>\n<p>Amazon announced in January of this year that it would <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amazon-nasdaqamzn-closes-more-physical-stores\">phase out seven sites </a>in Quebec “following a recent review” of its operations in the province.

The e-commerce company said it plans to return to a third-party delivery model to handle packages in that part of Canada.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Union Battles</strong></h2>\n<p>“What it calls the ‘new business model’ is just an attempt to circumvent its obligations under the Labour Code. The court should recognize that this scheme violates the law and it can then order the reinstatement of Amazon’s workers,” said CSN president Caroline Senneville in a written statement. </p>\n<p>Canada isn’t the only place where Amazon faces growing labor pressures. In the U.S., workers at an Amazon warehouse in North Carolina are slated to vote next week on whether to join a union.

Arya reiterated Nvidia as his top pick for 2025, with a price target of $190 per share, which equates to an upside of more than 61% at the time of writing. Indeed, he expects <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda/earnings\">Nvidia’s upcoming earnings report</a> on February 26 to be a catalyst for the stock.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Maximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:</h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Leverage the power of <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks\">TipRanks' Smart Score</a>, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions. </li><li>Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/smart-portfolio/holdings\"> Your Smart Portfolio</a></li></ul><p></p>\n<p>Arya’s optimism is based on his expectation that Nvidia will reassure investors about its Blackwell execution and signal that it is confident in its Fiscal Year 2026 outlook. He also anticipates that Nvidia’s upcoming GTC Conference, where the company will showcase its solid pipeline and physical <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> capabilities, will generate a lot of excitement. </p>\n<p>Despite Arya’s bullishness, Nvidia’s stock has declined 15% year-to-date, making it the second-worst performer among the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks. However, Arya views the decline as an opportunity and noted that Nvidia’s valuation has become more attractive. In fact, its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 26 times puts it near the lower end of its historical range.

The company has already spent $80 billion on the virtual reality and augmented reality technologies needed to develop smart glasses since the company first entered the space in 2014. Now, the company’s investment in VR and AR smart glasses is set to surpass $100 billion. </p>\n<p>Meta is reportedly planning to <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/meta-earnings-meta-platforms-financial-results-top-wall-street-forecasts\">invest $19.9 billion</a> in its Reality Labs unit that is responsible for making the company’s Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. On the company’s recent earnings call with analysts and media, Zuckerberg referred to the glasses as a “real hit,” along with its Quest VR headsets. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>One Million Sales </strong></h2>\n<p>Although <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/meta-platforms-price-target-raised-to-775-from-686-at-argus\">Meta doesn’t breakout sales</a> of its smart glasses, <em>The Financial Times</em> has reported that the company sold one million sets of the VR Ray-Bans in 2024 alone. With sales accelerating, Meta plans to pour an additional $20 billion into the Reality Labs unit this year as it develops next generation Ray-Ban smart glasses. The glasses are produced in partnership with EssilorLuxottica, Ray-Ban’s parent company.</p>\n<p>Some analysts have questioned the amount of money Meta continues to throw at Reality Labs given that the business unit had sales of only $2.1 billion last year. Operating losses at Reality Labs reached a record high of $17.7 billion during 2024 as the unit continues to work on cutting edge though unproven technologies.</p>\n<p>They are equipped with tiny cameras, microphones, and speakers to allow the user to take pictures, chat with an <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> assistant, or listen to music. Meta plans to launch the latest version of the glasses later this year that will feature a small display for the first time. META stock has risen 54% over the last 12 months. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is META Stock a Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>The stock of Meta Platforms has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 44 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 40 Buy, three Hold, and one Sell recommendations issued in the past three months. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta/forecast\">average META price target</a>&nbsp;of $693.51 implies 2.52% upside from current levels.

Indeed, the company sold preferred stock units at a discounted price of $80 apiece, which is 20% lower than the marketed price.

Unsurprisingly, the company plans to use this funding to support its Bitcoin-buying strategy. In addition, MicroStrategy’s ability to raise capital through this method shows that the market is interested in this asset class. In fact, the firm may raise up to $2 billion this quarter using this method.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that the preferred stock units offer a quarterly dividend and have a cumulative feature, which means that missed payouts will eventually be made. Furthermore, the conversion price is set at $1,000, which is roughly 200% above the latest closing price. This lofty threshold lowers the odds of conversion to common stock in the near term and delays the share dilution that would otherwise affect existing shareholders.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is MSTR a Good Stock to Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on MSTR stock based on nine Buys assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below.
