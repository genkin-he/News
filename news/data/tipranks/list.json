            "description": "<html><head></head><body><p>Five-star Bank of America analyst <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/vivek-arya\">Vivek Arya</a> is sticking with his bullish stance on chipmaker Nvidia <a data-ticker=\"NVDA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda\">(NVDA)</a> despite the stock’s recent sell-off. Arya reiterated Nvidia as his top pick for 2025, with a price target of $190 per share, which equates to an upside of more than 61% at the time of writing. Indeed, he expects <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda/earnings\">Nvidia’s upcoming earnings report</a> on February 26 to be a catalyst for the stock.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Maximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:</h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Leverage the power of <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks\">TipRanks' Smart Score</a>, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions. </li><li>Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/smart-portfolio/holdings\"> Your Smart Portfolio</a></li></ul><p></p>\n<p>Arya’s optimism is based on his expectation that Nvidia will reassure investors about its Blackwell execution and signal that it is confident in its Fiscal Year 2026 outlook. He also anticipates that Nvidia’s upcoming GTC Conference, where the company will showcase its solid pipeline and physical <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> capabilities, will generate a lot of excitement. </p>\n<p>Despite Arya’s bullishness, Nvidia’s stock has declined 15% year-to-date, making it the second-worst performer among the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks. However, Arya views the decline as an opportunity and noted that Nvidia’s valuation has become more attractive. In fact, its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 26 times puts it near the lower end of its historical range. This has led the analyst to label Nvidia as a “generational investment” with significant growth potential.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is NVDA a Good Stock to Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Overall, analysts remain bullish on NVDA stock, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 37 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months.

The company has already spent $80 billion on the virtual reality and augmented reality technologies needed to develop smart glasses since the company first entered the space in 2014. Now, the company’s investment in VR and AR smart glasses is set to surpass $100 billion. </p>\n<p>Meta is reportedly planning to <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/meta-earnings-meta-platforms-financial-results-top-wall-street-forecasts\">invest $19.9 billion</a> in its Reality Labs unit that is responsible for making the company’s Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. On the company’s recent earnings call with analysts and media, Zuckerberg referred to the glasses as a “real hit,” along with its Quest VR headsets. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>One Million Sales </strong></h2>\n<p>Although <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/meta-platforms-price-target-raised-to-775-from-686-at-argus\">Meta doesn’t breakout sales</a> of its smart glasses, <em>The Financial Times</em> has reported that the company sold one million sets of the VR Ray-Bans in 2024 alone. With sales accelerating, Meta plans to pour an additional $20 billion into the Reality Labs unit this year as it develops next generation Ray-Ban smart glasses. The glasses are produced in partnership with EssilorLuxottica, Ray-Ban’s parent company.</p>\n<p>Some analysts have questioned the amount of money Meta continues to throw at Reality Labs given that the business unit had sales of only $2.1 billion last year. Operating losses at Reality Labs reached a record high of $17.7 billion during 2024 as the unit continues to work on cutting edge though unproven technologies.</p>\n<p>They are equipped with tiny cameras, microphones, and speakers to allow the user to take pictures, chat with an <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> assistant, or listen to music. Meta plans to launch the latest version of the glasses later this year that will feature a small display for the first time. META stock has risen 54% over the last 12 months. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is META Stock a Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>The stock of Meta Platforms has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 44 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 40 Buy, three Hold, and one Sell recommendations issued in the past three months. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta/forecast\">average META price target</a>&nbsp;of $693.51 implies 2.52% upside from current levels.

Unsurprisingly, the company plans to use this funding to support its Bitcoin-buying strategy. In addition, MicroStrategy’s ability to raise capital through this method shows that the market is interested in this asset class. In fact, the firm may raise up to $2 billion this quarter using this method.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that the preferred stock units offer a quarterly dividend and have a cumulative feature, which means that missed payouts will eventually be made. Furthermore, the conversion price is set at $1,000, which is roughly 200% above the latest closing price. This lofty threshold lowers the odds of conversion to common stock in the near term and delays the share dilution that would otherwise affect existing shareholders.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is MSTR a Good Stock to Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on MSTR stock based on nine Buys assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below.

This program aims to set Travala apart from traditional booking sites that rely on old-school loyalty points.</p>\n<p>Travala’s expansion highlights the growing role of blockchain in real-world applications.

The update on Exxon Mobil’s stock comes after the oil and natural gas producer recently reported its fourth-quarter <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/company-announcements/exxonmobil-reports-strong-2024-financial-performance\">financial results</a>. </p>\n<p>Mehta said that the main reason for the lowered price target relates to valuation expectations for the stock, as well as a reduced earnings outlook. Goldman Sachs now forecasts that Exxon Mobil will post earnings per share (EPS) of $7.49 in 2025 and $9.41 in 2026, down from $8.17 and $9.97 previously. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Uncertain Oil Market</strong> </h2>\n<p>Goldman Sachs also noted an <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/chevron-exxon-nyse-xom-steady-as-opec-sticks-to-oil-plan-amid-volatile-session-for-crude\">uncertain outlook</a> for crude oil demand this year due to slowing economic growth in China and new regulations and policies in the U.S. under President Donald Trump. “Key risks relate to commodity prices, refining margins, and operational execution,” wrote Mehta in the report.</p>\n<p>Oil prices have been jostled in recent weeks following Trump’s inauguration as the new administration takes steps to promote greater oil production but also threatens tariffs on major trade partners such as China. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, the U.S. standard, is currently trading at $73.20 per barrel. <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/xom\">XOM stock has risen 12%</a> over the past year. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is XOM Stock a Buy? </strong></h2>\n<p>The stock of Exxon Mobil currently has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 18 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 13 Buy and five Hold recommendations assigned in the last three months.
