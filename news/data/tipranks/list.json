The analyst called Palantir the “Messi of AI Story” and lifted the price target to $120 from $90, while keeping a Buy rating.

Palantir stock also hit an all-time high of $106.91 on Tuesday, pushing its market capitalization to over $200 billion.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ives’ Views on Palantir’s Growth Potential</strong></h2>\n<p>Ives was impressed by Palantir’s fourth-quarter results and guidance, leading him to revise his model estimates for Fiscal 2025. The analyst noted that Palantir is one of the transformational tech stories that occur every decade and change the operational landscape. He was encouraged by the 43% year-over-year growth in customer count. Ives also noted that in Q4, the company secured 129 deals that were at least $1 million in value and 58 deals worth at least $5 million. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additionally, Ives believes that Palantir is spurring the AI revolution with its AIP (<a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a> platform) product moat, which remains matchless. Interestingly, Ives stated that PLTR is playing chess, while the remaining AI companies are playing checkers.</p>\n<p>Also, he feels that Palantir bears have missed the opportunity to dive into one of the generational tech stories since they cannot relate to AI, nor can they relate to Palantir’s high valuation. Ives also goes on to state that buying Palantir today is like buying Tesla <a data-ticker=\"TSLA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla\">(TSLA)</a> in 2015, and bears are clearly missing on this growth story.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>CEO Karp Says Palantir Still in Early Stages</strong></h2>\n<p>Palantir CEO <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/insiders/alexander-c.-karp\">Alex Karp</a> also shares the same views as Ives. In the Letter to Shareholders, Karp noted that PLTR is still in the early stages of the AI revolution and is yet to bear the massive fruits of its labor. Karp highlighted that the company is witnessing equal traction in both its commercial and government segments.</p>\n<p>In Q4 2024, sales from the PLTR’s U.S. commercial segment jumped 64% year-over-year. At the same time, sales from the U.S. government segment rose 45% compared to the prior-year quarter.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pltr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"937\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-142.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1708073\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-142.png 937w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-142-300x173.png 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-142-768x443.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 937px) 100vw, 937px\"></a></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Palantir Stock a Good Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Not all analysts share the same enthusiasm for Palantir stock as Ives.

            "description": "<html><head></head><body><p>President Donald Trump’s crackdown on trade could effectively kill the current business models of&nbsp;Chinese companies Shein and Temu <a data-ticker=\"PDD\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pdd\">(PDD)</a>, delivering a huge boost to Amazon <a data-ticker=\"AMZN\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn\">(AMZN)</a> in the process.&nbsp;</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Maximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:</h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Leverage the power of <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks\">TipRanks' Smart Score</a>, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions. </li><li>Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/smart-portfolio/holdings\"> Your Smart Portfolio</a></li></ul><p></p>\n<p>Specifically, in addition to the extra 10% tariff on Chinese goods, the president’s plans involve closing a 100-year-old loophole that allows online retailers to send small packages to the U.S. without paying tax.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The long-standing “de minimis” rule exempts shipments under $800 – but <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> wants this to no longer apply to goods coming from China, effectively adding a huge additional levy on online retailers such as Temu or Shein that would not apply to domestic retailers like Amazon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Citigroup analyst Alicia Yap said the impact on Temu could have a “negative read-through to its growth in 2025 and beyond.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a result of the rule change, companies like Temu, Shein and Alibaba will have to shift their business model to match that of Amazon’s, building warehouses in the U.S. from which to ship orders.</p>\n<p>Andrew Wilson, deputy secretary-general for policy at the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), told the <em>Financial Times</em>, the companies “will accelerate their moves towards what essentially is the Amazon model of having warehouses in the U.S.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Indeed, Temu already began moving its business model along these lines last year, recruiting Chinese suppliers with warehousing facilities or contracts in the U.S. as it moves from a “fully-managed” to a “semi-managed” model.</p>\n<p>But Citi points out that this part of the business remains small. Although Temu’s efforts in ramping up its U.S. warehouses and semi-managed model over the past year could help mitigate some of the tariff risks, they estimate the gross merchandise volume from local warehouses may have only accounted for about a fifth of U.S. sales last year.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>De Minimis Helped PDD&nbsp;</strong>Undercut U.S. Firms</h2>\n<p>Trump’s clampdown is not out of the blue. The Biden administration last year started to take steps to curb what it called the “overuse and abuse” of de minimis, saying it unfairly helped Chinese e-commerce companies undercut competitors with lower prices.&nbsp;Officials have also raised concerns about safety as the shipments are&nbsp;“subject to minimal documentation and inspection.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The volume of these shipments has skyrocketed from 139 million a year in 2015 to over 1.36 billion in 2024,&nbsp;with more than half of these originating in China. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ironically, the cost limit was increased from $200 to $800 in 2016 after lobbying by U.S. online retailers including eBay <a data-ticker=\"EBAY\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ebay\">(EBAY)</a> and Etsy <a data-ticker=\"ETSY\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/etsy\">(ETSY)</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This in turn helped fuel aggressive growth by China’s ecommerce companies in the U.S. market, which has put pressure on the likes of AMZN to counter. In response to this competition, the company in November&nbsp;launched a new outlet called Haul&nbsp;which caps the price of products on sale at $20.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But the closing of the loophole means shipments from China will be subject to existing tariffs plus the additional 10% tariff. Inspections at ports will also require longer shipping times and incur higher non-tariff costs.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is PDD a Good Stock to Buy?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>Overall, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, though none has updated price targets since last year. Analysts with a three-month price target are split along the lines of six Buys, four Holds and one Sell.

To get the ball rolling, Congress will establish a bicameral working group to hammer out digital asset regulations. According to <em>CoinDesk</em>, this initiative includes advancing stablecoin oversight and updating market structure rules.</p>\n<p>The move is all about keeping innovation on U.S. soil. Sacks emphasized that “financial assets are destined to become digital,” and the U.S. wants to stay at the forefront of this transition.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Stablecoins First in Line</strong></h2>\n<p>The Senate Banking Committee, chaired by Tim Scott, will tackle stablecoin legislation as an immediate priority. Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty introduced a bill that divides oversight between state agencies and federal regulators, such as the Federal Reserve. The goal? Strike a balance between fostering innovation and ensuring accountability.</p>\n<p>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, House Financial Services Chair French Hill said a stablecoin bill would work alongside a revamped version of last year’s Financial Innovation and Technology Act (FIT21), which aims to modernize U.S. market regulations for digital assets.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What This Means for Investors</strong></h2>\n<p>This development could mean a more stable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, potentially encouraging more institutional investment. Sacks’ push for innovation-friendly policies signals that the U.S. is serious about competing with crypto powerhouses like Switzerland and Singapore.</p>\n<p>With lawmakers rallying behind pro-crypto legislation, the U.S. digital asset landscape could see major shifts in the coming months.

Palantir also achieved a record-breaking $803 million in U.S. commercial TCV (total contract value), representing a 134% y/y increase. At the bottom line, adj. EPS of $0.14 beat the forecast by $0.03.</p>\n<p>And the momentum isn’t slowing. Palantir’s Q1 guidance came in well above expectations, with projected revenue between $858 million and $862 million, easily outpacing the Street’s $799.36 million estimate.</p>\n<p>For those still thinking Palantir’s 2024 performance will be hard to replicate, Bank of America analyst Mariana Perez Mora says last year was “only a dress rehearsal.”</p>\n<p>“The company sees the world ripe for an <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> and technology revolution. We see PLTR enabling and leading this revolution in both Commercial and Defense markets,” the 5-star analyst went on to say.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, Perez Mora sees another avenue where Palantir can make further headway. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) presents a significant opportunity for “government efficiency enablers,” with Perez Mora seeing Palantir as an “enabler of efficiency and clear winner.” If DOGE initiates an era of commercial-style contracting, digital-first development, and open, agnostic architecture needs, Palantir’s portfolio and “approach to government contracts is already in line.”</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, Perez Mora sees Palantir as a different kind of beast to other names operating the space, noting: “With the AI market becoming more crowded with more commoditized solutions; we think Palantir’s value proposition is only becoming more pronounced.”</p>\n<p>Moreover, the analyst anticipates greater market value will be assigned to the “AI value-adders vs. commodity distributors,” believing Palantir belongs squarely in the former club.</p>\n<p>Perez Mora didn’t just take notice – she took action. The analyst hiked her price target on PLTR to a Street-high of $125, indicating a potential upside of ~20% over the next year. It goes without saying, but Perez Mora’s rating remains a Buy. (To watch Perez Mora’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/mariana-perez-mora\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Most on the Street, however, think the stock has soared too much for now; the average price target stands at $78.67, a figure that sits 24% below the current share price. On the rating front, based on a mix of 11 Holds, 5 Sells and 2 Buys, the analyst consensus rates the stock a Hold (i.e., Neutral).

            "description": "<html><head></head><body><p><strong>Nvidia (</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda\"><strong>NASDAQ:NVDA</strong></a><strong>) </strong>remains in the spotlight as the tech world weighs the implications of DeepSeek’s latest breakthrough – a chatbot delivering results on par with top models while using only a fraction of the computing power. As the dominant player in <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> chips, Nvidia now faces the question of whether this shift could reshape demand for its high-performance hardware.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Maximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:</h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Leverage the power of <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks\">TipRanks' Smart Score</a>, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions. </li><li>Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/smart-portfolio/holdings\"> Your Smart Portfolio</a></li></ul><p></p>\n<p>That’s not the only storm cloud on the horizon. The looming threat of a global trade war, with proposed 100% tariffs on imported semiconductors, adds another layer of uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Some investors aren’t waiting to see how it all plays out – Nvidia’s stock has already tumbled 19% over the past week and a half as concerns take hold.</p>\n<p>Though acknowledging this “double whammy” brought on by DeepSeek and potential trade disruptions, top investor James Foord – who sits in the top 4% of TipRanks’ stock pros – spots an opportunity.</p>\n<p>“Buying Nvidia around $90-$100 ahead of Q4 earnings is a strategic move,” notes the 5-star investor.</p>\n<p>Foord is nonplussed by the DeepSeek and tariff worries, believing these risks are not as stark as some fear.</p>\n<p>When it comes to DeepSeek, the investor cites the Jevons paradox for assurances that the demand for AI hardware will remain hale and hearty. According to Jevons, Foord explains, when a resource becomes cheaper it also becomes more widely used.</p>\n<p>“Now that AI applications are actually affordable, there are potentially millions of companies and users that will be interested in deploying large language models, or LLMs, and this is still very good for Nvidia,” the investor explains.</p>\n<p>As for the tariff turmoil, Foord believes Nvidia’s pricing power will enable it to pass higher costs onto customers, safeguarding its margins in the process.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Foord is not overly concerned that Nvidia’s primacy is at risk, citing the company’s industry-leading CUDA software and the stalwart leadership of Jensen Huang and his leadership cadre.</p>\n<p>“This is still the same group of people that achieved over 90% dominance in GPUs thanks to superior vision and execution, and I believe we’ll continue to see this in the years to come,” concludes Foord.</p>\n<p>To this end, the investor rates NVDA a Strong Buy, hoping to gobble up shares around $100. (To watch Foord’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/bloggers/james-foord\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Wall Street echoes his bullish stance. With 37 Buys and just 3 Holds, NVDA boasts a Strong Buy consensus. Its 12-month average price target of $179.81 implies a potential 51% upside in the year ahead.
