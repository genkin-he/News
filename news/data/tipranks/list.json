Speaking at a Capitol Hill press conference on Tuesday, Sacks unveiled ambitious plans for U.S. crypto dominance, flanked by lawmakers from both the House and Senate.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Maximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:</h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Leverage the power of <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks\">TipRanks' Smart Score</a>, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions. </li><li>Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/smart-portfolio/holdings\"> Your Smart Portfolio</a></li></ul><p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Crypto Legislation Hits the Fast Lane</strong></h2>\n<p>Sacks made it clear that <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/trumps-crypto-czar-david-sacks-aims-to-redefine-digital-assets\">crypto is a top priority for the </a><a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> administration. “I look forward to creating a golden age in digital assets,” he stated. To get the ball rolling, Congress will establish a bicameral working group to hammer out digital asset regulations. According to <em>CoinDesk</em>, this initiative includes advancing stablecoin oversight and updating market structure rules.</p>\n<p>The move is all about keeping innovation on U.S. soil. Sacks emphasized that “financial assets are destined to become digital,” and the U.S. wants to stay at the forefront of this transition.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Stablecoins First in Line</strong></h2>\n<p>The Senate Banking Committee, chaired by Tim Scott, will tackle stablecoin legislation as an immediate priority. Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty introduced a bill that divides oversight between state agencies and federal regulators, such as the Federal Reserve. The goal? Strike a balance between fostering innovation and ensuring accountability.</p>\n<p>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, House Financial Services Chair French Hill said a stablecoin bill would work alongside a revamped version of last year’s Financial Innovation and Technology Act (FIT21), which aims to modernize U.S. market regulations for digital assets.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What This Means for Investors</strong></h2>\n<p>This development could mean a more stable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, potentially encouraging more institutional investment. Sacks’ push for innovation-friendly policies signals that the U.S. is serious about competing with crypto powerhouses like Switzerland and Singapore.</p>\n<p>With lawmakers rallying behind pro-crypto legislation, the U.S. digital asset landscape could see major shifts in the coming months.

This move can be seen as TSLA’s attempt to reignite the price war in the highly competitive Chinese electric vehicle market.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Maximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:</h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Leverage the power of <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks\">TipRanks' Smart Score</a>, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions. </li><li>Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/smart-portfolio/holdings\"> Your Smart Portfolio</a></li></ul><p></p>\n<p>It must be noted that the incentive comes shortly after Tesla raised prices for all Model 3 variants in the Chinese market.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tesla Offers Incentives to Boost Chinese Sales</strong></h2>\n<p>After the insurance subsidy, the starting prices of the three variants are reduced to RMB 227,500, RMB 267,500, and RMB 331,500, respectively, making them attractive to Chinese consumers.</p>\n<p>In addition to the subsidy, buyers can also take advantage of the five-year zero-interest financing option. Together, the subsidy and financing option reduce the upfront cost for buyers, with down payments starting at just RMB 79,900. By offering incentives, Tesla aims to boost sales and maintain its market share.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Price War Heats Up as XPeng Responds to Tesla</strong></h2>\n<p>It is worth mentioning that just hours after Tesla announced the subsidy, XPeng <a data-ticker=\"XPEV\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/xpev\">(XPEV)</a> revealed its offer of zero down payment and zero-interest financing for up to five years on some of its models. Further, existing XPeng owners who purchase the Mona M03 model will receive 1,500 kWh of free charging per year for four years.</p>\n<p>This move by XPEV effectively marks the beginning of another price war in China. In 2023, Tesla had already sparked a fierce price war by offering multiple insurance subsidies and price cuts throughout the year.</p>\n<p>Further, TSLA and XPEV’s offers are likely to trigger a response from other <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/electric-vehicles\">EV</a> manufacturers in China, including BYD <a data-ticker=\"BYDDF\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/byddf\">(BYDDF)</a>, Nio <a data-ticker=\"NIO\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nio\">(NIO)</a>, Li Auto <a data-ticker=\"LI\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/li\">(LI)</a>, and Zeekr <a data-ticker=\"ZK\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/zk\">(ZK)</a>.

Revenue climbed by 36% year-over-year to reach $827.52 million, $46.28 million above the Street’s call. That figure included a 64% y/y jump in U.S. commercial revenue, which reached $214 million, while U.S. government revenue increased by 45% to $343 million.</p>\n<p>Amongst other strong metrics, the company completed 129 deals worth at least $1 million, 58 deals valued at $5 million or more, and 32 deals exceeding $10 million. Palantir also achieved a record-breaking $803 million in U.S. commercial TCV (total contract value), representing a 134% y/y increase. At the bottom line, adj. EPS of $0.14 beat the forecast by $0.03.</p>\n<p>And the momentum isn’t slowing. Palantir’s Q1 guidance came in well above expectations, with projected revenue between $858 million and $862 million, easily outpacing the Street’s $799.36 million estimate.</p>\n<p>For those still thinking Palantir’s 2024 performance will be hard to replicate, Bank of America analyst Mariana Perez Mora says last year was “only a dress rehearsal.”</p>\n<p>“The company sees the world ripe for an <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> and technology revolution. We see PLTR enabling and leading this revolution in both Commercial and Defense markets,” the 5-star analyst went on to say.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, Perez Mora sees another avenue where Palantir can make further headway. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) presents a significant opportunity for “government efficiency enablers,” with Perez Mora seeing Palantir as an “enabler of efficiency and clear winner.” If DOGE initiates an era of commercial-style contracting, digital-first development, and open, agnostic architecture needs, Palantir’s portfolio and “approach to government contracts is already in line.”</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, Perez Mora sees Palantir as a different kind of beast to other names operating the space, noting: “With the AI market becoming more crowded with more commoditized solutions; we think Palantir’s value proposition is only becoming more pronounced.”</p>\n<p>Moreover, the analyst anticipates greater market value will be assigned to the “AI value-adders vs. commodity distributors,” believing Palantir belongs squarely in the former club.</p>\n<p>Perez Mora didn’t just take notice – she took action. The analyst hiked her price target on PLTR to a Street-high of $125, indicating a potential upside of ~20% over the next year. It goes without saying, but Perez Mora’s rating remains a Buy. (To watch Perez Mora’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/mariana-perez-mora\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Most on the Street, however, think the stock has soared too much for now; the average price target stands at $78.67, a figure that sits 24% below the current share price. On the rating front, based on a mix of 11 Holds, 5 Sells and 2 Buys, the analyst consensus rates the stock a Hold (i.e., Neutral).

As the dominant player in <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> chips, Nvidia now faces the question of whether this shift could reshape demand for its high-performance hardware.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Maximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:</h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Leverage the power of <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks\">TipRanks' Smart Score</a>, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions. </li><li>Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/smart-portfolio/holdings\"> Your Smart Portfolio</a></li></ul><p></p>\n<p>That’s not the only storm cloud on the horizon. The looming threat of a global trade war, with proposed 100% tariffs on imported semiconductors, adds another layer of uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Some investors aren’t waiting to see how it all plays out – Nvidia’s stock has already tumbled 19% over the past week and a half as concerns take hold.</p>\n<p>Though acknowledging this “double whammy” brought on by DeepSeek and potential trade disruptions, top investor James Foord – who sits in the top 4% of TipRanks’ stock pros – spots an opportunity.</p>\n<p>“Buying Nvidia around $90-$100 ahead of Q4 earnings is a strategic move,” notes the 5-star investor.</p>\n<p>Foord is nonplussed by the DeepSeek and tariff worries, believing these risks are not as stark as some fear.</p>\n<p>When it comes to DeepSeek, the investor cites the Jevons paradox for assurances that the demand for AI hardware will remain hale and hearty. According to Jevons, Foord explains, when a resource becomes cheaper it also becomes more widely used.</p>\n<p>“Now that AI applications are actually affordable, there are potentially millions of companies and users that will be interested in deploying large language models, or LLMs, and this is still very good for Nvidia,” the investor explains.</p>\n<p>As for the tariff turmoil, Foord believes Nvidia’s pricing power will enable it to pass higher costs onto customers, safeguarding its margins in the process.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Foord is not overly concerned that Nvidia’s primacy is at risk, citing the company’s industry-leading CUDA software and the stalwart leadership of Jensen Huang and his leadership cadre.</p>\n<p>“This is still the same group of people that achieved over 90% dominance in GPUs thanks to superior vision and execution, and I believe we’ll continue to see this in the years to come,” concludes Foord.</p>\n<p>To this end, the investor rates NVDA a Strong Buy, hoping to gobble up shares around $100.

The analyst believes that the company is well-positioned for gains in 2025, driven by steady AWS acceleration and retail margin expansion. He further added that in retail, fixed cost leverage should help boost the company’s margins.</p>\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/justin-post\">Justin Post of Bank of America Securities</a> maintains a Buy rating, citing Amazon’s strong growth in AWS and retail margins. The analyst believes that AI-driven AWS demand, robotics-led productivity gains, and Prime Video ad growth, among others, remain key catalysts going forward.

Revenue of $9.60 billion fell short of Wall Street’s forecast of $9.64 billion. </p>\n<p>The company blamed the poor results on what it called “unprecedented <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/mondelez-nasdaqmdlz-and-hershey-cut-as-barry-callebaut-says-sky-high-cocoa-prices-weigh-on-outlook\">cocoa cost</a> inflation,” and added that it expects the situation to worsen moving forward.

In Mondelez’s case, the company owns Cadbury and produces popular chocolate bars such as Dairy Milk and 5Star, as well as Cadbury Creme Eggs. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mdlz\">MDLZ stock has declined 23%</a> over the past 12 months. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is MDLZ Stock a Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>The stock of Mondelez International has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 18 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 12 Buy and six Hold recommendations assigned in the past three months. The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mdlz/forecast\">average MDLZ price target</a> of $68.25 implies 21.61% upside from current levels.

The main cause of this jump was a steep increase in Instinct GPU shipments, along with strong growth in AMD EPYC CPU sales. </p>\n<p>However, its Gaming segment saw a 59% year-over-year decrease to $563 million.

Sales were up 13% from a year earlier. </p>\n<p>Chipotle also reported that its same-store sales rose 5.4% in Q4 2024, narrowly missing consensus estimates of 5.7% growth. Transactions at its restaurant outlets increased 4%, building on the burrito chain’s growth in foot traffic. In September, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/article/class-action-lawsuit-against-chipotle-mexican-grill-nysecmg-dont-miss-out\">Chipotle</a> brought back its Smoked Brisket offering, which management said has proven popular with restaurant patrons.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Store Openings</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/company-announcements/chipotle-approves-2025-ceo-compensation-package\">Chipotle Mexican Grill</a> opened 120 new restaurant outlets during the fourth quarter, including one international location.
