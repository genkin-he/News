Despite the revenue growth, the company reported a net loss of $3.9 million for Q4 and $20.8 million for the entire year, although non-GAAP results reflected a positive net income of $2.8 million for Q4 and $5.9 million for the year.</p>\n<p>Key performance indicators highlighted include a gross margin of 11.6% on a GAAP basis for Q4 and a slightly higher non-GAAP margin of 12.0%. The fiscal year gross margin stood at 12.2% on a GAAP basis. The company faced cost headwinds due to ramping up its direct labor force and one-time inventory charges which affected gross margins. However, a significant improvement in gross margin is expected in 2025 as these factors are anticipated to diminish.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Ichor Holdings projects a strong business environment with continued robust demand for leading edge foundry and logic investments, alongside a recovery in memory investments. The company expects to outgrow the wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) market in 2025, with a significant improvement in gross margin and earnings leverage.</p>\n<p>Overall, Ichor Holdings anticipates a positive trajectory into the first quarter of 2025, with revenue expectations ranging from $235 million to $255 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS between $0.20 and $0.32, indicating a potential financial rebound and growth in the coming fiscal period.</p>\n</body></html><div id=\"trending\" class=\"trending-posts\"><h2 class=\"fontWeightsemibold textDecorationunderline\">Trending Articles:</h2><ul><li><a data-link='article_trending' href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/buy-in-around-100-says-investor-about-nvidia-stock\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">‘Buy In Around $100,’ Says Investor About Nvidia Stock</a></li> <li><a data-link='article_trending' href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/palantir-stock-hits-a-new-street-high-price-target\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Palantir Stock Hits a New Street-High Price Target </a></li> <li><a data-link='article_trending' href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/dont-wait-for-the-boom-to-bust-says-investor-about-tesla-stock\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">‘Don’t Wait for the Boom to Bust,’ Says Investor About Tesla Stock</a></li></div>",
