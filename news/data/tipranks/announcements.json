The gross margin improved to 84%, reflecting a favorable product mix. Tobii’s cost reduction program contributed to the improved EBIT, with SEK 73 million in savings achieved by the end of the year. However, the company reported a full-year loss of SEK 177 million, with free cash flow at negative SEK 345 million due to substantial R&amp;D investments following the acquisition of FotoNation/AutoSense.</p>\n<p>Tobii’s strategic initiatives, including the integration of Autosense and ongoing cost reduction measures, are expected to streamline operations and enhance profitability. The company remains focused on achieving a positive free cash flow by 2026, with a target operating margin of 10% for the same year.</p>\n</body></html><div id=\"trending\" class=\"trending-posts\"><h2 class=\"fontWeightsemibold textDecorationunderline\">Trending Articles:</h2><ul><li><a data-link='article_trending' href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/buy-in-around-100-says-investor-about-nvidia-stock\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">‘Buy In Around $100,’ Says Investor About Nvidia Stock</a></li> <li><a data-link='article_trending' href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/palantir-stock-hits-a-new-street-high-price-target\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Palantir Stock Hits a New Street-High Price Target </a></li> <li><a data-link='article_trending' href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/dont-wait-for-the-boom-to-bust-says-investor-about-tesla-stock\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">‘Don’t Wait for the Boom to Bust,’ Says Investor About Tesla Stock</a></li></div>",
