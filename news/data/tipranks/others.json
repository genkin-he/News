Just like in Kenny Rogers’ The Gambler, where “every hand’s a winner, and every hand’s a loser,” success depends on how you play the cards you’re dealt. A gambler reads faces; an investor reads the market’s signals.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Maximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:</h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Leverage the power of <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks\">TipRanks' Smart Score</a>, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions. </li><li>Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/smart-portfolio/holdings\"> Your Smart Portfolio</a></li></ul><p></p>\n<p>Few signals are clearer than <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-insider-trading-stocks\">insider trading activity</a>. The insiders are the corporate officers with responsibility for ensuring that their company brings in a profitable return – think C-suite residents and Boards of Directors. They know what’s happening behind the scenes, and they use that knowledge to inform their own trading. To keep the playing field level, Federal regulators require that these officers make their inside trading moves public.</p>\n<p>When you watch insider trades, just remember that they’ll sell for any number of reasons – but they’ll only buy when they are sure the stock will go up.</p>\n<p>This makes insider trades a valuable signal for investors. And when those trades are combined with other favorable factors in a stock, such as high dividend yields or solid upside potential, the result is a brightly flashing neon signal that this is a stock deserving of your closer attention.</p>\n<p>A dip into the TipRanks database has brought two such stocks to our attention. Each offers a dividend return along with a double-digit upside potential – and each has seen a recent insider buy of $1 million or more. Let’s take a closer look.</p>\n<p><strong>Sunrise Realty Trust</strong> <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/suns/forecast\"><strong>SUNS</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>The first stock on our list, Sunrise Realty Trust, is a real estate investment trust, a REIT. Sunrise is new to the public trading markets, but not new to the business. The company was formed as an independent, publicly traded entity in July of last year, through a spin-off separation transaction initiated by the parent company AFC Gamma. AFC Gamma was already a REIT, with business activities in both the cannabis and commercial real estate sectors. The firm chose to retain its cannabis business while spinning off the commercial real estate side as Sunrise Realty Trust.</p>\n<p>The result is a new REIT with a focus on commercial real estate, CRE, in the Southeast of the US. The company has several properties in its portfolio, all located in desirable urban markets in Florida and Texas. Sunrise acts as an institutional lender, originating and funding loans on these properties. The company has focused its lending activities on a narrow niche, mainly upscale and/or luxury residential projects, hotels, and commercial spaces. The company has chosen the Southeast as its area of activity due to the region’s expanding demographic and economic profile.</p>\n<p>Shares in Sunrise started trading on the NASDAQ on July 10, and since then the company has paid out two common stock dividends. The first, paid out on October 15, was for 21 cents per common share (a partial quarter cash dividend); the second, paid out on January 15, was for 42 cents. The January payment gives an annualized rate of $1.68 per common share and a forward yield of 14%.</p>\n<p>Turning to the insiders, we find that Sunrise Executive Chairman Leonard Tannenbaum made a hefty purchase of SUNS shares during the final week of January. He picked up one million shares, paying $12 million for the tranche of stock. Tannenbaum’s holding in this newly public REIT totals over $35.5 million.</p>\n<p>Sunrise has caught the attention of Alliance Global analyst Gaurav Mehta, who particularly likes the company’s potential for expansion and its forward dividend yield.</p>\n<p>“Our Buy rating is based on a strong loan pipeline that provides an opportunity to grow, no legacy loans with issues, a focus on southern US with above-average employment and population growth, and an attractive common dividend yield of 14%,” Mehta noted.</p>\n<p>That Buy rating is supported by a $14.50 price target, implying a one-year upside potential of 22%. Factoring in the dividend yield, the stock’s potential one-year return could reach as high as 36%. (To watch Mehta’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/gaurav-mehta\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>SUNS is still a bit under the radar, and only has 2 recent analyst reviews. They both agree, however, that it’s a stock to buy, making the consensus view a Moderate Buy. The shares are selling for $11.87 and their $14.75 average price target indicates room for a 24% upside over the next 12 months.

Ally’s services to customers include automotive loan financing, online banking, vehicle insurance, corporate banking, and mortgage loans. The company is invested in its hometown, and its headquarters are located in one of Detroit’s premier modern skyscrapers, the Ally Detroit Center, overlooking the city’s financial district.</p>\n<p>Ally has been in business since 1919. Until 2010, the company was known as GMAC, General Motors Acceptance Corporation, and acted as the customer financing arm of automotive giant GM. The company remains a major name in automotive financing, and in the full year 2024, Ally originated $39.2 billion worth of volume in consumer auto loans. The company has $192 billion in total assets and boasts approximately 11 million customers.</p>\n<p>In recent months, Ally has moved to focus on its core business of banking services and auto financing and, to that end, has divested itself of its credit card business. Last month, the company reached an agreement with CardWorks, Inc., under which Ally will sell off its credit card portfolio, which includes $2.3 billion in credit card receivables with 1.3 million active cardholders. The transaction is expected to close later this year.</p>\n<p>Ally pays out a regular common share dividend and made its last declaration on January 17. That declaration was for a 30-cent payout, scheduled for February 14. The company has held the dividend at this level for 13 quarters; the $1.20 annualized common share payment gives a forward yield of 3.1%.</p>\n<p>The company’s most recent insider buy came from CEO Michael George Rhodes, who bought 25,634 shares during the last week in January. Rhodes paid over $1 million for this purchase.</p>\n<p>Turning to Ally’s financial position, we find that the company has recently reported its results for Q4 and full-year 2024. For the fourth quarter, Ally reported revenues of $2.1 billion, up 5% year-over-year and $80 million better than had been expected. The company’s bottom line came to 78 cents per share by non-GAAP measures, beating the forecast by 21 cents. For the full year, Ally’s revenues were $8.2 billion, and the non-GAAP EPS came to $2.35.</p>\n<p>Investors should also note that Ally reported a strong position against potential losses. The company calculated its Q4 core return on tangible common equity (core ROTCE) as 11.3%, and the corresponding figure for the full year as 8.5%. The company managed this even as Q4 net interest margin (NIM) registered a year-over-year gain of just 11 basis points, reaching 3.3%. The company reports that the modest gain was driven by “lower funding costs,” a factor that should improve for Ally in the long term with completion of the card business exit.</p>\n<p>These are key points for Citi analyst Keith Horowitz, who covers Ally. The 5-star analyst has looked under the hood of this Detroit bank and writes, “While exiting the card business poses headwind to NIM (disclosed ~20bps on full-year basis), mid-teens ROTCE target remains intact and mgmt. sees it as achievable with high-3s NIM, in tandem with sub-2% auto losses and expense discipline. We see ~4% NIM in ’26 through deposit repricing (4Q beta was better than our estimate at ~36%) and fixed-rate asset repricing with origination yields expected to improve off 4Q seasonal low of 9.6% (mgmt. guided to high-9s to 10% in near term). We continue to expect large upside in the name over the med-term on underlying trends driving ROTCE towards mid-teens target in ’26.”</p>\n<p>For the long haul, Horowitz describes ALLY as a “‘Show me’ story starting to deliver,” and rates the stock as a Buy. He complements the upbeat rating with a $55 price target that points toward a one-year upside potential of 44%. (To watch Horowitz’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/keith-horowitz\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Overall, there are 17 recent analyst reviews for Ally, and their breakdown – 9 to Buy, 7 to Hold, and 1 to Sell – gives the stock its Moderate Buy consensus rating. ALLY shares are trading for $38.18, and their $44.86 average target price implies a 17.5% upside in the next 12 months.

Watch out for <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/microstrategy-mstr-is-about-to-report-q4-earnings-tomorrow-heres-what-to-expect\">MSTR’s earnings call later today</a> after the closing bell. <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mstr/earnings\">Wall St. analysts expect</a> MSTR to report a loss per share of $0.09 for Q4 2024 compared to an EPS of $0.50. For those looking to gain legitimized exposure to the <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency\">crypto</a> craze, MSTR and its dazzling strategy are a worthy option.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>MicroStrategy is the Ultimate Leveraged Bitcoin Play</strong></h2>\n<p>MicroStrategy’s investment thesis is quite straightforward: it’s a leveraged bet on Bitcoin’s price. Originally a business intelligence and analytics software company under CEO Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy is now the largest holder of Bitcoin in the world, with around 447,470 Bitcoins in its treasury, valued at $46.75 billion.</p>\n<p>Over the past few years, MicroStrategy has accumulated this massive amount of Bitcoin through a brilliant strategy consisting of (1) taking on debt and (2) issuing equity to buy more Bitcoin. As the company has capitalized on the high volatility of the leading cryptocurrency, most of its debt is issued through <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/microstrategy-completes-previously-announced-3b-notes-offering\">convertible bonds at nearly 0% interest rates</a>, allowing investors to convert their holdings into MSTR stock later, in a form where shareholders are not immediately diluted. In other words, people are lending money to MicroStrategy at no cost, hoping the shares will rise above the conversion price.</p>\n<p>Thus, as higher Bitcoin prices increase equity value, it creates a positive feedback loop whereby MicroStrategy can borrow increasingly more capital to buy increasingly more Bitcoin. Arguably, the results have been phenomenal since the company began executing this strategy in 2020. Investors who bought MSTR stock instead of directly purchasing Bitcoin saw returns in excess of 2,000%, compared to Bitcoin’s 1,207% over the same period.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy Warrants a Premium</strong></h2>\n<p>Although justified by its recent strong performance, MicroStrategy’s strategy of acquiring more Bitcoin comes at a cost. This is evident when the company’s net asset value (NAV) in Bitcoin is 1.8x, meaning MSTR investors are effectively paying almost double the value of Bitcoin to gain exposure to Michael Saylor’s active treasury strategy.</p>\n<p>The most obvious reaction would be to go short on MicroStrategy based on this relevant premium, and arguably, there is a notable short interest of 10.8% of MicroStrategy’s float being shorted, according to the most recent data. However, what I believe bears are missing at this point is that beyond using available capital and liquidity for opportunistic Bitcoin purchases, MicroStrategy is actually revolutionizing the financial markets by introducing fixed-income instruments with derivative exposure to Bitcoin.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Share Dilution in Perspective</strong></h2>\n<p>MicroStrategy shares are down around 26% since their last peak at the end of November last year, and even with Bitcoin hitting new highs since then, the stock has failed to achieve the same despite the high correlation.</p>\n<p>The recent weakness in MicroStrategy’s stock is likely tied to the potential for a nearly 30x increase in its authorized shares, filed in late December last year and recently approved. The plan details an increase in Class A common stock shares from 330 million to a staggering 10.33 billion—something that initially scared investors about massive dilution.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mstr/financials/balance-sheet\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"397\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSTR4-1024x397.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1708359\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSTR4-1024x397.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSTR4-300x116.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSTR4-768x298.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSTR4.jpg 1229w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n<p>As part of the company’s strategy, issuing equity is one of the two ways to acquire more Bitcoins. Frankly, dilution is exactly what MicroStrategy’s strategy needs to come to fruition. However, the potential 10.33 billion raised shares will not necessarily be immediately used for new financing potential.</p>\n<p>If MicroStrategy converted all the shares at once, or a substantial amount of them, it could potentially raise trillions of dollars if the market had the capacity to absorb the entire share price. Although I don’t see this being feasible in a short space of time, the trend is that MicroStrategy will keep things going with its convertible bonds and at-the-market offerings to make the most out of its shares and gradually raise these potential trillions worth of new shares over the next few years.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, in that case, the dilution will only be accretive as long as it provides cheap financing and Bitcoin keeps appreciating.</p>\n<p>In my view, such concerns on stock dilution create an opportunity for investors who believe in MicroStrategy’s strategy to buy the stock at an NAV of 1.8x. This level has acted as support over the past year and arguably represents a good entry point, given the further potential upside in Bitcoin in the near term.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is MSTR Stock a Good Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>As things stand, there isn’t a single Wall Street analyst who isn’t bullish on MicroStrategy stock. MSTR is rated as a&nbsp;Strong Buy, supported by nine Buy recommendations. The stock’s average price target is $557.50 per share, implying a potential upside of 60% from its current price.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mstr/forecast\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"358\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSTR2-1024x358.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1708287\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSTR2-1024x358.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSTR2-300x105.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSTR2-768x268.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSTR2.jpg 1230w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mstr/forecast\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"272\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSTR3-1024x272.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1708288\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSTR3-1024x272.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSTR3-300x80.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSTR3-768x204.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSTR3.jpg 1215w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mstr/forecast\">See more MSTR analyst ratings</a></strong></figcaption></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bitcoin’s Biggest Bull to Continue Wild Ride</strong></h2>\n<p>MicroStrategy is a Bitcoin proxy with an extraordinarily clever strategy of owning and buying the cryptocurrency by issuing debt and selling equity, capitalizing on the hype.

The company’s impressive performance, driven by persistent Bitcoin purchases and share dilution, might raise some doubts; however, if the crypto revolution continues and Bitcoin maintains its status as the leading coin — MSTR’s billion-dollar gamble will pay off handsomely.</p>\n<p>While a crypto winter seems unlikely for now, buying MSTR shares at the current NAV premium, likely shaken by somewhat exaggerated dilution fears, seems like a good entry point for investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/legal/disclosure-1\">Disclosure</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/legal/disclaimer\">Disclaimer</a></p>\n</body></html>",

LLY’s key target market is set to grow rapidly over the next two years, and the company is well-positioned to capitalize on it—especially with the launch of its oral weight-loss drug, Orforglipron. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Earnings Announcement Set to Propel LLY Stock Higher</strong></h2>\n<p>Eli Lilly is set to report <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lly/earnings\">Q4 2024 earnings on February 6, 2025</a>, with management expecting $13.5 billion in revenue—a massive 45% year-over-year jump. Driving this surge? Explosive demand for its weight-loss drugs Mounjaro ($3.5 billion) and Zepbound ($1.9 billion). Looking ahead, Lilly forecasts $58–$61 billion in 2025 revenue, marking a staggering 32% growth at the midpoint.</p>\n<p>Eli Lilly’s stock dipped after its Q4 guidance came in lower than expected. With a P/E ratio of 85.9, any slowdown was bound to trigger a sell-off. While demand for GLP-1 drugs isn’t growing as fast as some hoped, seasonality may be at play—meaning a more substantial rebound could be coming as the new financial year kicks off.</p>\n<p>Novo Nordisk <a data-ticker=\"NVO\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvo\">(NVO)</a> has the edge with Rybelsus, its already-approved oral GLP-1, and trades at a much lower P/E of just 27, making it the more reasonable value play. Meanwhile, Lilly is the high-growth bet, with a pipeline that could deliver big wins beyond weight loss; I’m impressed by its upcoming oral GLP-1 (Orforglipron) and an Alzheimer’s drug in the works.</p>\n<p>I only own NVO right now, but LLY’s potential is hard to ignore. It’s pricier, but the diversified pipeline and strong momentum make the stock tempting, especially on a medium-term horizon. Tough call—do I stick with Novo, add Lilly, or go all in on both?</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>High Valuations Leave No Room for Error</strong></h2>\n<p>With a towering price-to-earnings ratio nearing 90, Eli Lilly has little margin for error or underperformance. Yet, genuinely great companies often command premium valuations. My main caution is that its P/E ratio has surged 45% above its five-year average. However, this is hardly a red flag given that its earnings growth rate is 232% higher over the same period.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lly/financials/income-statement\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LLY5-1024x400.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1707989\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LLY5-1024x400.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LLY5-300x117.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LLY5-768x300.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LLY5.jpg 1232w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n<p>If I’ve learned one thing in investing, it’s that the market loves companies with plenty to admire under the hood. With January 2027 revenue of $75 billion, a net income margin of 35%, and 890 million diluted shares, the company will have diluted earnings per share of $29.50. From there, it only needs to trade at a moderate price-to-earnings ratio of 40 to reach my $1,200 price target—significant growth from the current $825 per share.</p>\n<p>However, investors could face significant risk if the weight-loss market loses momentum over the next two years. Emerging long-term side effects could lead to reduced demand and cautious stocking by pharmacies, triggering stock price volatility amid lower revenue projections.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That’s why I’m not investing too heavily in GLP-1 stocks. Like <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> stocks, their sky-high valuations and potential shifts in demand make me believe it’s wiser to hold these companies for a few years rather than taking a rigid buy-and-hold approach.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Eli Lilly Is Worth More than GLP-1 Drugs</strong></h2>\n<p>Lilly isn’t just riding the weight-loss drug wave—it’s building a balanced, future-proof pipeline. By diversifying its portfolio, the company reduces risk and strengthens investor confidence. Also, Lilly focuses on biologics rather than small-molecule drugs, making them more challenging for competitors to replicate. If all goes well, new treatments for various diseases like Donanemab, Mirikizumab, and Lebrikizumab could bring in up to $15 billion annually by 2030.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lly/dividends\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"277\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LLY1-1024x277.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1707998\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LLY1-1024x277.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LLY1-300x81.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LLY1-768x208.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LLY1.jpg 1232w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n<p>Moreover, Eli Lilly’s leadership is a powerhouse. Under CEO David Ricks, who took the helm in 2017, the company has thrived and outpaced its Big Pharma rivals with exceptional stock performance and <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lly/dividends\">steadily climbing dividends</a>. What’s the secret? Smart acquisitions, relentless cost control, and a laser focus on high-growth opportunities. By strategically investing in innovation while keeping expenses in check, Lilly has generated massive free cash flow, fueling its future pipeline and delivering value to investors.</p>\n<p>The more I dig into Eli Lilly’s business, the more confident I become. Beyond the GLP-1 hype, there’s a powerhouse of innovation, thoughtful leadership, and a rock-solid pipeline. This isn’t just a weight-loss drug story—it’s a long-term growth machine. And that’s why I’m staying bullish.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Eli Lilly a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>On Wall Street, Eli Lilly holds a Strong Buy consensus rating of 16 Buy, two Hold, and zero Sell ratings. The average LLY price target of $1,002 per share suggests a 21.3% upside over the next 12 months, reinforcing my bullish outlook. Even the lowest target of $900 offers a solid return from the current $825.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lly/forecast\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"348\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LLY3-1024x348.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1707742\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LLY3-1024x348.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LLY3-300x102.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LLY3-768x261.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LLY3.jpg 1232w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lly/forecast\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"269\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LLY4-1024x269.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1707748\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LLY4-1024x269.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LLY4-300x79.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LLY4-768x202.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LLY4.jpg 1217w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lly/forecast\">See more LLY analyst ratings</a></strong></figcaption></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>LLY Stands Out as a Superb Medium-Term Returns Generator</strong></h2>\n<p>Eli Lilly is a powerhouse with a strong track record of success, including a 16-year dividend track record. This week’s Q4 earnings announcement will be a pivotal moment for investors, with the potential to catalyze the ongoing uptrend or push LLY into breaking its uptrend and allow the stock to reel further losses as investor confidence is shaken. </p>\n<p>Despite last year’s earnings stumble, LLY has rebounded strongly, and its long-term growth story remains intact. With a healthy 250% gain over the past 3 years, steady-eddy dividends, and several popular drugs being commercialized — this pharma giant is well-positioned. While any stock can see ups and downs, Wall Street remains bullish, and demand for GLP-1 medications is undeniable—making LLY a smart buy.</p>\n<p>The pharma titan’s future looks secure and set for further expansion with a diverse pipeline of innovative drugs that dovetails with growing consumer trends. Meanwhile, the recent pullback offers medium-long-term investors a superb market entry opportunity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/legal/disclosure-2\">Disclosure</a></p>\n</body></html>",

Although I’m a long-term Apple bull and recognize it as one of the companies with the strongest business fundamentals globally, I believe this is a moment to exercise caution with Apple stock. </p>\n<p>There is a case to be made that the current tech rally is set for a correction and stocks like Apple could feel the worst of it, given its specific metrics.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"793\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAPL.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1706029\" style=\"aspect-ratio:1.2688;width:675px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAPL.jpg 793w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAPL-300x236.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAPL-768x605.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px\"></a></figure></div>\n<p>In my view, there’s not enough to justify committing to a long position in Apple. The stock is trading at historically high valuations, growth isn’t exceptional, and headwinds are mounting. Until I see Apple demonstrating its ability to spark growth through new catalysts, I’m staying on the sidelines.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Strong Results Suggest AAPL Has Peaked</strong></h2>\n<p>Overall, Apple’s consolidated results were solid, albeit uneventful, and left little room for investors to fault them. The Big Tech giant <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/company-announcements/apples-stellar-earnings-call-record-revenue-growth\">delivered another beat across the board</a>, exceeding consensus EPS by 5 cents and revenues by $273 million, showing year-over-year growth of 10% and 3.9%, respectively.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl/earnings\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"377\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Image-03-02-25-at-12.19-1-1024x377.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1701975\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Image-03-02-25-at-12.19-1-1024x377.jpeg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Image-03-02-25-at-12.19-1-300x110.jpeg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Image-03-02-25-at-12.19-1-768x283.jpeg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Image-03-02-25-at-12.19-1-1536x566.jpeg 1536w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Image-03-02-25-at-12.19-1.jpeg 1640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n<p>On the top line, Apple reported total net sales increasing by $4.8 billion, with much of the solid revenue growth coming from the Services segment, which I see as great news for investors, considering that the segment is nearly twice as profitable as the Product segment.</p>\n<p>On the bottom line, Apple’s gross profit margin jumped by $4 billion, which shows that the increase in top-line revenue has directly led to an increase in the company’s margins, as Apple has effectively managed costs in an increasingly complex environment for a company of its size.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, when we look at EPS, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl/earnings\">Apple reported $2.40 in FYQ1</a>, compared to $2.18 in the same period last year, showing increased profitability. Another essential factor is the company’s share repurchase program, with Apple spending $23.6 billion on quarterly buybacks. As the company buys back shares, EPS generally increases due to a smaller share count and higher earnings.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl/buybacks\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"330\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAPL2-1024x330.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1706111\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAPL2-1024x330.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAPL2-300x97.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAPL2-768x247.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAPL2.jpg 1232w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Chinese Roadblocks for Apple’s iPhone</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the main reasons behind my more conservative take on Apple stock is the high negative impact Apple has experienced in China due to rising competition and declining iPhone sales. In FYQ1, Apple’s revenues in China fell by over $2.3 billion, from $20.8 billion to $18.5 billion. On the bright side for Apple investors, this part of AAPL’s business continues to shrink and become increasingly less relevant, contributing roughly 15% of Apple’s consolidated sales.</p>\n<p>Another less-than-enthusiastic point was that iPhone sales were not increasing. Revenue came in at $69.1 billion, down from $69.7 billion, and the estimates coming into the quarter were that iPhone sales would be around $71 billion. So, this was a miss by about $2 billion in the most critical product for Apple and the gateway to Apple’s ecosystem.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Political Tensions and Tariffs Threaten Bullish AAPL Story</strong></h2>\n<p>When it comes to China, the uncertainties don’t stop there. Political pressure is weighing even more heavily on Apple in China, especially with <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/djia-update-dow-jones-drops-as-stocks-react-to-president-trumps-impending-tariffs\">President </a><a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> considering imposing 10% import tariffs on Chinese goods. It’s worth noting that, in Apple’s case, the company relies heavily on China for its supply chain, despite recent efforts in recent years to diversify via India and Vietnam.</p>\n<p>During the Q4 earnings call, when asked about the impacts of these alleged tariffs imposed by President Trump, CEO Tim Cook replied that he has been monitoring the situation closely but had nothing to comment. While tariffs are a point of debate, the markets are divided on how they will affect large multinational firms in the short and long term. Trump’s tariffs could just be saber-rattling or the beginnings of a protracted trade war weighing on companies in both countries for years to come.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Apple’s Valuation is Pricey When Adjusted for Growth</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite being one of the most generative companies in the world and reducing its dependence on the iPhone, Apple’s current valuation is still very pricey, especially when adjusting for growth.</p>\n<p>Apple is trading at a forward 32x earnings, 14% higher than its five-year historical average. This can mainly concern a hardware-based company with lower margins than software peers. The main problem is that this multiple should match a company expected to grow EPS at 9.5% over the next three to five years, which is inconsistent with a robust growth stock.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I am skeptical that the current dynamics may bring a more limited upside for Apple in the near term, especially in the immediate term, considering political headwinds. I think the upside will be limited until Apple can show more growth and muscular earnings potential—possibly driven by the upcoming iPhone AI supercycle and continued services expansion.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Apple a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>While Wall Street’s consensus on AAPL is somewhat mixed, with a Moderate Buy rating based on 18 Buy, ten Hold, and four Sell ratings over the past three months, several analysts have raised their price targets following the FYQ1 results. AAPL’s&nbsp;average price target&nbsp;currently&nbsp;stands at $251.60 per share, indicating a 10.7% upside potential from its current levels.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl/forecast\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"355\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAPL3-1024x355.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1706143\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAPL3-1024x355.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAPL3-300x104.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAPL3-768x266.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAPL3.jpg 1236w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl/forecast\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"271\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAPL4-1024x271.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1706144\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAPL4-1024x271.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAPL4-300x80.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAPL4-768x204.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAPL4.jpg 1215w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl/forecast\">See more AAPL analyst ratings</a></strong></figcaption></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Limited Short-Term Upside for AAPL Despite Solid Earnings</strong></h2>\n<p>Even with solid record earnings results in Q4 last year, I continue to rate Apple stock as a Hold. Given modest growth expectations, I struggle to see much upside ahead, especially compared to other growth companies in the tech space. Although pricey valuations somewhat justify a business with such quality and robust fundamentals, headwinds in China and iPhone sales are discouraging, at least in the short to medium term.</p>\n<p>At 32x forward earnings, locking in gains here and exploring other opportunities might be wise, though holding could still make sense for those with a long-term view.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/legal/disclosure-2\">Disclosure</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/legal/disclaimer\">Disclaimer</a></p>\n</body></html>",

The stock regained some ground in pre-market trading today – up 0.5% – as its shareholders continued to fret about what the Vanguard move could do to BlackRock revenues and demand.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Will BlackRock follow ‘Game-Changing’ Move?</strong></h2>\n<p>Vanguard said the fee reductions – which some analysts referred to as “game-changing” – are expected to save investors more than $350 million this year alone and was part of its long-running strategy of “limiting the cost of investing.” It fits in well with the trend of more investors looking to low-cost investing options such as passive ETFs, which track an index or industry sector.</p>\n<p>The question, both for the industry and for BlackRock investors, is whether it will follow suit and cut its own fees to remain competitive. This could herald a race to the bottom on fees – good news for investors but perhaps not so welcome to BlackRock shareholders.</p>\n<p>Or, conversely, BlackRock could see an opportunity to create a quality or service gap between itself and Vanguard. That may mean marketing itself going forward as an asset manager more focused on providing a continued wide range of products than being the cheapest.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>BlackRock Remains Asset Leader</strong></h2>\n<p>BlackRock remains in a strong position with $11.6 trillion of assets under management compared with around $10.4 trillion at Vanguard. BlackRock is also a <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/dividend-stocks\">dividend stock</a> returning $4.7 billion back to shareholders in 2024. This strength is reflected in its 12-month share price performance, which has seen the stock climb 32.53%. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is BLK a Good Stock to Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>On TipRanks, BLK has a Strong Buy consensus based on 13 Buy and 2 Hold ratings.

            "description": "<html><head></head><body><p>During the 2024 election campaign, candidate <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> pledged to implement tariffs as punitive and protective measures. Now, as President, he has acted on this promise. Trump announced a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, with Canadian energy resources subject to a lower 10% tariff. Additionally, a 10% tariff was imposed on imports from China.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Maximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:</h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Leverage the power of <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks\">TipRanks' Smart Score</a>, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions. </li><li>Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/smart-portfolio/holdings\"> Your Smart Portfolio</a></li></ul><p></p>\n<p>Following negotiations, Mexico and Canada have agreed to enhance border security to address U.S. concerns over illegal immigration and drug trafficking. As a result, the implementation of tariffs on imports from these countries has been delayed by 30 days to allow for further discussions. However, the tariff on Chinese imports has taken effect immediately</p>\n<p>If fully implemented, these tariffs could reshape the U.S. steel market – Canada alone supplies about 40% of U.S. steel imports. The most immediate impact? Higher steel prices. Domestic producers will likely raise their prices in response to the increased cost of imported steel, which will ripple through the supply chain and affect consumers.</p>\n<p>However, this shift isn’t all bad news for U.S. steelmakers. As manufacturers reduce their reliance on imports, domestic producers stand to benefit from both higher prices and increased demand. This could lead to a boost in U.S. steel company revenues and stock prices as the market adjusts.</p>\n<p>Against this backdrop, Wall Street’s analysts are keeping an eye on steel stocks as hot choices for investors. We’ve opened up the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/\">TipRanks database</a> to look at two steel stocks that the analysts are tagging as likely gainers in the coming year. These aren’t big upside names, but they offer steady returns with room for growth. Let’s examine what sets them apart.</p>\n<p><strong>Steel Dynamics</strong> <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/stld/forecast\"><strong>STLD</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>The first stock we’ll look at is the Indiana-based Steel Dynamics. This company, which has a total production capacity of nearly 13 million tons per year, focuses on the production of lower-carbon-emission, quality steel, mainly produced from recycled ferrous scrap – that is, scrap iron – using electric arc furnace (EAF) technology.</p>\n<p>Steel Dynamics operates three main operational divisions: steel, metals recycling, and steel fabrication. The first of these, steel, includes a full range of industrial steel products: hot and cold roll, coated sheet steel, structural steel beams, steel rails, specially engineered bar-quality steel, cold finished steel, and specialty steel sections. The metals recycling division processes both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals from items such as automobiles, machinery, and appliances, as well as manufacturing scraps, and prepares them for sale to end-users capable of reusing the scrapped materials and producing new steel products from them. Steel Dynamics’ steel fabrication division handles the production of structural steel joist and deck building systems for consumer markets.</p>\n<p>Steel is a huge business; it’s found in everything from our skyscrapers to our refrigerators, our cars, and our furniture. You can’t get through a day without using something made out of steel.</p>\n<p>Despite that basic fact, Steel Dynamics has seen both revenues and earnings trend downward in recent quarters. For 4Q24, Steel Dynamics reported $3.87 billion in revenues, a figure that was down 8.5% year-over-year and missed the forecast by $90 million. Earnings, reported as a GAAP EPS of $1.36, while also down YoY, were 8 cents per share better than expected.</p>\n<p>This stock has caught the attention of Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina, who is focused on the near- to mid-term future for Steel Dynamics and sees an opportunity at play. He writes of the company and its prospects, “Our base case is for steel prices to rise in 2H25 and into 2026. While at a full run-rate the aluminum investment will partially dilute STLD’s leverage to steel prices, we see less headline M&amp;A risk for this company relative to some other major producers in our coverage. As such, these shares may be the cleanest option for investors who want leverage to US steel market fundamentals and the potential tailwinds under a Trump administration.”</p>\n<p>In summary, LaFemina puts a Buy rating on the shares, with a $145 price target that implies a 12-month gain of 13%. (To watch LaFemina’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/chris-lafemina\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>The 9 recent analyst reviews on STLD break down to 4 Buys and 5 Holds, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The stock is currently trading for $127.92, and its $146.38 average price target suggests that the stock will appreciate by 14.5% in the year ahead.

The company, which is based in Charlotte, North Carolina, is also the largest scrap recycler operating in the North American market. Nucor was founded in 1955, and today produces a full range of steel and steel products. These include rebars, beams, plates, and sheets used in construction and industry, as well as hot and cold finish steel, steel decking, fasteners, gratings, joists, metal building systems and overhead doors, pilings, steel pipes and tubes, and even steel wire products.</p>\n<p>In addition to all of that, Nucor is a major player in the scrap recycling and brokerage business, turning metal scrap into usable steel products and selling the reused metals to industrial customers. Nucor is a major provider of new and recycled steel products to the automotive and construction industries, and even provides specialty steel products to data center customers. The company prides itself on its ability to remain a competent and efficient manufacturer, and to generate consistent free cash flows despite the highly cyclical nature of the steel industry. This can be seen in the company’s cash position; at the end of 2024, Nucor had $4.14 billion in cash and other liquid assets on hand – and its revolving credit facility, worth $1.75 billion, was undrawn.</p>\n<p>Nucor declared a 55-cent common share dividend payment on December 11, scheduled to be sent to shareholders on February 11. This marks the company’s 207th consecutive quarterly cash dividend – Nucor has not missed a quarterly payment since it started paying dividends in 1973. While the dividend is rock-solid reliable, the yield is modest – the $2.20 annualized rate gives a forward yield of 1.7%.</p>\n<p>Looking at the company’s overall results, we find that Nucor had $7.08 billion in revenue during 4Q24. This was down 8.2% year-over-year, but it beat the forecast by $350 million. The company’s EPS came to $1.22 in the quarter, 59 cents per share better than had been anticipated. For the full year 2024, Nucor reported $30.73 billion in revenues.</p>\n<p>For Lawson Winder, from Bank of America, Nucor presents a sound buying opportunity. He believes that the company’s forecast of an improving steel industry will bear fruit, and says of Nucor’s prospects in the coming year, “Per NUE, market conditions are starting to improve and should gain momentum as the year progresses. In our view, though spot hot-rolled-coil (HRC) pricing remains subdued, we still see potential for a rally in H1’25. NUE should benefit from the rebound in HRC and hold up better in a correction given attractive exposure (relative to peers) to longs/diverse downstream products. Capital returns could also continue to remain robust despite elevated capex in the near-term. NUE has completed two-thirds of its $10 billion (bn) investment plan and is yet to realize the earnings potential from recently completed projects.”</p>\n<p>Winder rates NUE shares as a Buy, and his $160 price target indicates a one-year upside potential of 22%. (To watch Winder’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/lawson-winder\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Like Steel Dynamics above, Nucor has 9 recent analyst reviews; in Nucor’s case, these split into 5 Buys and 4 Holds for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares have a selling price of $131.30 and an average target price of $156.25; together, these prices imply a gain of 19% on the 12-month horizon.

            "description": "<html><head></head><body><p>Despite China’s DeepSeek model disrupting the broader <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a> ecosystem, Nvidia <a data-ticker=\"NVDA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda\">(NVDA)</a> remains the underlying hardware king.

However, bullish investors can harness a particular options strategy to replicate big payouts over weeks, not years.</p>\n<p>I’m bullish on a rebound in NVDA stock and continue to believe it will deliver strong returns for shareholders. However, there is a cleaner way of gaining exposure to the tech/AI theme and NVDA stock while generating even more substantial returns than traditional stock investing.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Understanding the Statistical Context Behind NVDA Stock</strong></h2>\n<p>The first order of business is to recognize the short-term nature of options trading. Unlike the underlying security, options are classified as “wasting assets” because they all eventually expire worthless. Therefore, if you wager on so-called cheap options — or options far out the money — you effectively engage in binary transactions: you are either winning or losing.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the progression of time exponentially reduces the option’s premium value as it nears expiration, which tends to mean options traders think short-term. Therefore, focusing on optionable securities like NVDA isn’t about broader fundamentals but pricing behaviors based on statistical trends.</p>\n<p>Primarily, the key element that makes NVDA stock attractive to options traders is its upward bias. Statistically, when considering data over the trailing five years, traders who enter a position at the beginning of the week have a 56.98% chance of being profitable by the end of it. Over four weeks, the long odds improve to just over 66%.</p>\n<p>In other words, outside of a truly compelling reason to be contrarian, the numbers favor taking a shot on NVDA stock.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/NVDA-stock-probability-gambit.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/NVDA-stock-probability-gambit-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1703089\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/NVDA-stock-probability-gambit-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/NVDA-stock-probability-gambit-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/NVDA-stock-probability-gambit-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/NVDA-stock-probability-gambit.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n<p>However, the market operates with human emotions, and responses can vary depending on fluctuations in the fear-greed continuum. Last week, NVDA stock incurred a loss of 3.79%. Whenever NVDA loses up to 5% of value over one week, there’s a 67.53% chance that the equity will have landed in positive territory by the end of the fourth subsequent week.</p>\n<p>Stated differently, there’s evidence that investors tend to buy the dip during sizable declines (for the record, negative weeks over the past five years in NVDA carry a median loss of 3.7%). This framework provides all the more evidence that speculators are justified in wanting to buy Nvidia at a discount.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong>Options Traders Smell Blood</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>Viewing Nvidia stock pricing data in no other context aside from the temporal — NVDA may reach $134.36 over the next four weeks, assuming the positive scenario materializes. If the negative scenario occurs, there is a statistical risk that NVDA could fall to $111.79, according to the options chain expiring Feb. 28. From a dynamic perspective, NVDA is on pace to hit $133.70 per share in an optimistic scenario or fall to $111.79 in an adverse scenario. With this market intelligence, investors can execute a bullish options strategy called the bull call spread.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda/options-chain\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"514\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/NVDA3-1024x514.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1704248\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/NVDA3-1024x514.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/NVDA3-300x150.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/NVDA3-768x385.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/NVDA3.jpg 1240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n<p>Under a bull spread, the trader buys a call option and simultaneously sells a call at a higher strike price (for the same expiration date). The idea is to use the credit received from the short call to partially offset the debit paid for the long call.</p>\n<p>To be sure, the sale of the short call necessarily caps the reward at the representative strike price. However, the benefit is that the net cash outlay to enter the bullish position is discounted. Further, this discounting lowers the threshold to breakeven, improving the speculator’s odds of success compared to a call-only acquisition.</p>\n<p>Now, the beauty of the bull spread comes in the form of the reward. If NVDA stock reaches $134, that’s a decent 11.6% return. However, if you only wager a thousand dollars on NVDA, the nominal reward would be $116. In contrast, the bull spread can offer far better rewards, depending on the specific transaction.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Options Allow Ideal Blend of Risk and Reward</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the reasons why investors tend to shy away from multi-leg options strategies like the bull call spread is due to the plethora of available spreads. How does one know which spread to pick?</p>\n<p>Let me tell you a little secret: it’s just like soccer.</p>\n<p>In the beautiful game, you improve your scoring chances by committing more players to the attack. At the same time, you leave yourself vulnerable to a counterattack. If you’re worried about conceding a goal, you can take speculative long shots without committing too many players to the attack, although the chances of success are low.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda/options-chain\">the options arena</a>, the 111/134 bull call spread (buy the $111 call, sell the $134 call) for the options chain expiring Feb. 28 would be an example of a high-commitment attack. As of Monday’s close, the net debit required stood at $895 for the chance to earn $1,405 (a payout of 156.98%).</p>\n<p>So long as NVDA stock doesn’t drop below $111 by Feb. 28, traders may be able to salvage some intrinsic value out of the long call. However, if Nvidia implodes (i.e., the market’s devastating counterattack), the trader will lose the entire net debit paid to enter the trade.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, you can select the 132/134 bull spread. This trade only requires a $60 cash outlay for the chance to earn $140, or a payout of 233.33%. However, NVDA stock must reach $134 just to break even.

Ultimately, it’s about structuring the trade like a calculated offensive play—balancing risk and reward based on market probabilities.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/legal/disclosure-1\">Disclosure</a>.</p>\n</body></html>",

            "description": "<html><head></head><body><p>Wall Street’s reaction to American Airlines’ <a data-ticker=\"AAL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aal\">(AAL)</a> Q4 earnings numbers was reactionary at best, briefly halting the airline’s long and steady climb since August 2024. After publishing its <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/company-announcements/american-airlines-reports-strong-2024-financials\">Q4 figures on January 23</a>, the market clipped AAL’s wings, with the stock now trading ~10% lower and 3% lower since the start of the year. </p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Maximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:</h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Leverage the power of <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks\">TipRanks' Smart Score</a>, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions. </li><li>Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/smart-portfolio/holdings\"> Your Smart Portfolio</a></li></ul><p></p>\n<p>The airline’s conservative outlook for the current quarter surprised many, especially since analysts had expected brighter forecasts. Yet I believe that focusing solely on management’s guidance risks overlooking some tangible progress American Airlines has made. There are compelling reasons to think AAL’s rally has more mileage, from record revenues to accelerated debt reduction. For this reason, I remain bullish on AAL stock despite its recent sell-off.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aal\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"792\" height=\"425\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1702383\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL.jpg 792w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL-300x161.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL-768x412.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 792px) 100vw, 792px\"></a></figure></div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Wall Street Disappointment Creates Buy-the-Dip Opportunity</strong></h2>\n<p>American Airlines posted an adjusted net income of $609 million, or $0.86 per share, for Q4. Although that figure was a positive surprise in isolation, the company’s guidance for the first quarter of FY2025 left much to be desired. Management projected an adjusted loss per share between $0.20 and $0.40 for the quarter, which landed below most analysts’ estimates.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aal/earnings\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"263\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-30-1024x263.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1701555\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-30-1024x263.png 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-30-300x77.png 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-30-768x197.png 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-30.png 1355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n<p>Caution in the aviation sector often emerges from a mix of rising costs and uncertain demand. For American Airlines, labor expenses were indeed a notable culprit, as non-fuel unit costs grew 5.7% year-over-year in Q4, largely due to higher compensation from recent union agreements. Additionally, the airline indicated a seasonally soft start to 2025, with capacity down about 3% in January and February before picking up in March. Considering all of that, it becomes clear why AAL’s uneven demand pattern probably spooked investors with brighter expectations.</p>\n<p>Another red flag for some analysts was the airline’s conservative capacity strategy. American Airlines plans to grow full-year capacity by low single digits, which raised questions about whether it can maintain pricing power in an increasingly competitive environment. With travel patterns still evolving in the post-pandemic era, I would argue that investors might have hoped for a bolder approach to capturing market share.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Several Upbeat Developments Spell Elevation for AAL</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite management’s conservative tone, I see plenty to like under AAL’s hood. The airline reported a record Q4 revenue of $13.7 billion, marking a 4.9% year-over-year increase and beating consensus estimates by $280 million. For this reason, I believe the underlying demand for air travel remains strong. Travel is seasonal, not linear. The seasonably soft start to 2025 is probably attributed to a month-over-month correction and not necessarily softening performance overall.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aal/financials/balance-sheet\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"392\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL4-1024x392.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1702459\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL4-1024x392.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL4-300x115.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL4-768x294.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL4.jpg 1236w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n<p>Moreover, American Airlines scored a major win in debt reduction, reaching its goal of cutting $15 billion from its total debt (from peak levels) a full year early. Given how critical debt management is in such a capital-intensive industry, I find this to be a significant leading indicator. By strengthening its balance sheet faster than expected, AAL puts itself in a better position to weather short-term turbulence and invest in future growth opportunities, even if concerns over a soft start to 2025 persist.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Attractive Valuation at Temporarily Depressed Levels</strong></h2>\n<p>Although AAL’s long-term up-trend took a brief pause last week following Wall Street’s negative reaction, American Airlines’ shares are still up ~80% over the past six months. Yet, the stock looks attractively priced from a forward-looking perspective. Specifically, consensus EPS stands at $2.38 for FY2025 and $3.07 for FY2026, implying annual growth rates of 21.6% and 28.8%, respectively. At these estimates, AAL trades at a forward P/E ratio of around 7.1x for 2025 and just 5.5x for 2026.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aal/earnings\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL5-1024x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1702460\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL5-1024x300.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL5-300x88.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL5-768x225.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL5.jpg 1224w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n<p>To me, these ratios suggest the market is underappreciating the airline. It’s true that airlines often trade at seemingly depressed multiples due to cyclical pressures, including fuel price volatility, labor negotiations, and broader economic headwinds. Nevertheless, American Airlines expects to generate a record free cash flow of $1.90 billion this year. Along with the ongoing debt reduction, the airline has a strong foundation that warrants a modestly more optimistic valuation, in my view.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is American Airlines (AAL) Stock a Buy or a Sell?</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite the initial cautious reaction post-earnings, analysts seem optimistic about AAL’s investment case. Over the past three months, American Airlines has gathered 10 Buy, seven Hold, and zero Sell ratings, obtaining a Moderate Buy consensus on Wall Street. Currently,&nbsp;AAL stock carries an average price target of $21.56 per share, implying a 28% upside potential from current price levels.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aal/forecast\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL2-1024x343.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1702414\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL2-1024x343.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL2-300x100.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL2-768x257.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL2.jpg 1227w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aal/forecast\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"268\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL3-1024x268.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1702416\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL3-1024x268.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL3-300x79.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL3-768x201.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AAL3.jpg 1217w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aal/forecast\">See more AAL analyst ratings</a></strong></figcaption></figure>\n<p>If you haven’t yet decided which analyst you should trust to buy or sell AAL stock, the most accurate and profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/michael-linenberg\">Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank</a> <a data-ticker=\"DB\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/db\">(DB)</a>.

The company’s record revenues, accelerated debt reduction, and attractive valuation all point to tangible progress. While near-term challenges exist, the market’s skepticism creates an opportunity given the stock’s compelling forward multiples. </p>\n<p>With <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> tariff worries also affecting sentiment and casting doubt over consumer spending, now could be the time to look beyond the short-term market noise to realize that AAL is a long-standing market performer that has weathered tougher storms. Not only is the stock likely to rejoin its long-term uptrend, but its single-digit forward multiples should offer plenty of room for maneuvering for value investors.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/legal/disclosure-1\">Disclosure</a></p>\n</body></html>",

Furthermore, Virtu boasts an integrated, multi-asset analytics platform, offering pre and post-trade services, data products, and compliance tools.</p>\n<p>The company has reported strong results for its recent <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency\">crypto</a> growth initiative despite market volumes and spot crypto <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/etf\">ETFs</a> being down by almost 20% compared to Q1 of 2024. This success has been attributed mainly to the investments in its crypto capabilities during the second and third quarters of the year. Virtu’s strategy to expand its global crypto footprint was instrumental in capturing significant opportunities in the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>In addition to the crypto initiative, Virtu plans to enhance its ETF block offering further to attract more clients and distribute liquidity more broadly. The company believes regulatory changes in 2025 will present another expansion opportunity for Virtu’s market-making and execution services.</p>\n<p>Virtu has recently been recognized with multiple accolades at The TRADE Leaders in Trading Awards, including Best Access to Market and Best Dark Pool Capabilities. The company’s broker-neutral, multi-asset-class execution management system, Virtu Triton EMS, received recognition for its user experience, adaptability, and service for large clients in the UK and Europe.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Impressive Top-and-Bottom-line Growth</strong></h2>\n<p>The company recently posted impressive fourth-quarter financial results. <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/virt/financials\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/virt/financials\">Revenue grew by 55.7% year-over-year to $834.3 million</a>. Trading income increased by 104%, bringing the total to $544 million. The net income for the quarter was $176.1 million, a marked improvement from the $6.7 million net income of the previous year.

Trading income rose by 40.0%, totaling $1.822 billion. The year’s net income was $534.5 million, compared to $263.9 million for 2023. This led to basic and diluted earnings per share of $2.98 and $2.97, respectively, a considerable increase from the $1.42 earnings per share of 2023.</p>\n<p>As of the end of 2024, the company reported $914.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash.

For example, Piper Sandler’s <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/patrick-moley\">Patrick Moley</a>, a five-star analyst according to Tipranks’ ratings, recently reiterated an Overweight rating on the shares and raised the price target to $40 (from $35), noting a more relaxed regulatory outlook for 2025, as well as a lower potential rate environment, further emboldening trading activity.</p>\n<p>Virtu Financial is rated a Moderate Buy overall, based on the recent recommendations of nine analysts.

Given the robust revenue growth and margins, I believe these ongoing investments are enough to support a long-term bullish outlook on Microsoft, which boasts some of the best-in-class business fundamentals of any sector.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Another Strong Quarter for Microsoft</h2>\n<p>Overall, my bullishness on Microsoft remains firm after another solid quarter was reported, which marked the tenth consecutive earnings beat. <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/msft-earnings-microsoft-stock-falls-on-weak-cloud-computing-growth\">Microsoft delivered EPS of $3.23</a> when Wall Street was expecting $3.11.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft/earnings\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"725\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Image-01-02-25-at-16.06-1024x725.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1698156\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Image-01-02-25-at-16.06-1024x725.jpeg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Image-01-02-25-at-16.06-300x212.jpeg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Image-01-02-25-at-16.06-768x544.jpeg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Image-01-02-25-at-16.06.jpeg 1322w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n<p>Additionally, Microsoft reported revenues of $69.9 billion, up 12% year-over-year and $823 million above the consensus estimate. Based on its three segments, the one that grew the most was the Intelligent Cloud business, which jumped 19%. In the consolidated results, gross margins reached 69%—arguably one of the best gross margins among any businesses in the world—while Microsoft’s operating profit margin jumped to 45% with a total operating income of $31.7 billion. Again, very few businesses can boast such sturdy results.</p>\n<p>On the operational side, Microsoft reported commercial booking revenues grew year-over-year by 67% in FYQ2. Even with seemingly rock-solid numbers, it wasn’t enough to please the markets, as MSFT stock shed ~6% post-earnings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Matters Most for MSFT</h2>\n<p>Arguably, a great chunk of Microsoft’s 31.5x forward earnings multiple is directly related to its progress with AI implementation, particularly in its most profitable segment today—the cloud business. The Intelligent Cloud segment has been one of the main drivers of the almost 75% share price appreciation over the last two years.</p>\n<p>However, the big reason for skepticism after Microsoft’s results was precisely two key issues regarding the cloud business. The first was that revenue growth from Azure and other cloud services fell from 33% in FYQ1 to 31% in FYQ2. The second point was that the guidance for FYQ3 was for growth between 31% and 32%, still below what MSFT recorded two quarters ago.</p>\n<p>According to Microsoft’s management team, the explanation for this has nothing to do with weakening demand for AI services but rather two factors: (1) challenges in non-AI components, where companies are trying to balance the migration of their work with adopting AI workloads. There is a challenge in adjusting investments, and this process often takes time and impacts results; and (2) the capacity limit affecting the performance of the segment, which still needs more infrastructure to sustain growth—even though the long-term infrastructure investments made in recent years are still not enough.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft/financials/income-statement\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSFT5-1024x394.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1699358\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSFT5-1024x394.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSFT5-300x115.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSFT5-768x295.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSFT5.jpg 1233w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n<p>The other topic of concern was Microsoft Cloud margins. The outlook for FYQ3 implies margins of 69%, which would be the lowest margins since FYQ2 2024. It’s worth noting that in FYQ1, the cloud division’s gross margins had already fallen quarter-over-quarter from 73% to 71%, and now, in FYQ2, margins were at 70%. </p>\n<p>Management argues that the margin drop correlates with the impact of scaling the AI infrastructure. However, the reality is that investors were disappointed to see $22.6 billion in capital expenditure supporting AI initiatives in the three months when margins and growth rates have been impacted. Even though the funding comes from free cash flow (which also fell 29% year-over-year thanks to these AI spendings) and not from extra debt.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rising RPOs and Bookings Back Ongoing AI Investment</h2>\n<p>Contributing to my bullish thesis on Microsoft, although the cloud results show an inevitable slowdown, I’m still very encouraged by the overall context. The company has been spending on developing its business clearly because it is seeing a customer response. This is quite evident when we look at the remaining commercial performance obligations (RPO), which are currently soaring, partly due to AI.</p>\n<p><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">Microsoft’s RPOs are currently at $298 </span>billion, an&nbsp;increase of&nbsp;$39 billion from FYQ1 and about $76 million higher compared to last year, showing very robust rates of increase. So, we see tangible results in RPOs which supports the case for continued investment in AI infrastructure.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is Microsoft a Buy, Hold, or Sell?</h2>\n<p>Although Microsoft’s earnings report displeased the market, the bullish consensus prevails.</p>\n<p>On TipRanks, the stock carries a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 28 Buy, three Hold, and zero Sell ratings over the past three months. Notably, not a single analyst rates MSFT as a Sell despite last week’s earnings call stumble. Currently, MSFT’s average price target of $508.68 per share implies a 22.5% upside potential from current levels.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft/forecast\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSFT2-1024x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1699329\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSFT2-1024x351.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSFT2-300x103.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSFT2-768x263.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSFT2.jpg 1237w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft/forecast\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"268\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSFT3-1024x268.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1699330\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSFT3-1024x268.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSFT3-300x79.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSFT3-768x201.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MSFT3.jpg 1229w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft/forecast\">See more MSFT analyst ratings</a></strong></figcaption></figure>\n<p>It’s worth noting that although there were no downgrades, there were four price target trims, the most significant of which came from Wolfe Research analyst <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/alex-zukin\">Alex Zukin</a>, who downgraded his price target from the previous $515 to $475. According to the analyst, he points out that Microsoft shares “are likely range bound until such time as either execution or capacity improves.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">MSFT Continues to Offer Superb Exposure to the Tech Market</h2>\n<p>Microsoft’s quarterly results showed that the company struggled to sustain its high revenue growth rates and margins, particularly in the cloud. However, most of these challenges were unrelated to demand, which, in my view, is key to supporting the case for continued infrastructure investments. This demand is clearly demonstrated by the solid growth in RPOs. </p>\n<p>As a result, short-term market skepticism seems misplaced, and a long-term buy-and-hold strategy appears to be the more reasonable approach for Microsoft stock. Moreover, MSFT is still trading at a 7% discount in early trade this week, making this tech giant a strong buy-the-dip contender in early 2025.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/legal/disclosure-2\">Disclosure</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/legal/disclaimer\">Disclaimer</a></p>\n</body></html>",

Unlike the computers we currently use daily, quantum computing leverages a concept called qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This complex but incredibly exciting idea enables a range of performance improvements exponentially faster than current capabilities. IonQ differentiates itself from others with trapped-ion technology, which theoretically enables a further range of complex improvements, including longer coherence times (how long the computation can operate) and improved qubit connectivity (the ability for the technology to talk to itself while processing).</p>\n<p>Competition in the space is naturally fierce, with mega-caps such as Google <a data-ticker=\"GOOGL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl\">(GOOGL)</a> and IBM <a data-ticker=\"IBM\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ibm\">(IBM)</a> looking to build out capabilities alongside more nimble start-ups such as Rigetti Computing <a data-ticker=\"RGTI\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/rgti\">(RGTI)</a> and D-Wave Systems <a data-ticker=\"QBITS\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/qbits\">(QBITS)</a>. Of course, this battle could dominate the market for years as technology advances, but breakthroughs are notoriously unpredictable and require enormous resources. </p>\n<p>IBM and Google have demonstrated some capabilities in quantum error correction, which looks to minimize the number of errors conducted in processing. IonQ is still somewhat untested in this area, and with one eye on practical execution at commercial levels, investors will want to see proof that trapped-ion systems are indeed the way forward.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">IonQ’s Financial Sustainability Puts Valuation into Doubt</h2>\n<p>Despite being one of the larger companies in the space, at a market cap of $8.4 billion, a look at the balance sheet shows it is a long way from profits. Management has secured some impressive contracts in the last few years, including a $54.4 million USAF Research Lab deal, but this does not come cheaply, with operating costs rising 36% in the last year, now at $65.5 million. This has led to a <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ionq/earnings\">net loss of $54.5 million in Q3</a>, significantly worse than the $44.8 million Q3 loss in the previous year. While losses are to be expected with emerging technology, especially in the initial stages, investors will be looking for signs that the technology has some earnings potential at scale rather than just being an experiment for several companies. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ionq/earnings\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"251\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-1408-1024x251.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1697355\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-1408-1024x251.png 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-1408-300x74.png 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-1408-768x189.png 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-1408.png 1181w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n<p>The company holds some decent cash reserves at $36 million, far outweighing the debt of just under $4 million, but I’d be keeping an eye on the burn rate of the business, which could eventually lead to share dilution as more financing is required. This has been significant in previous years and could potentially be a major barrier to investor confidence, with shares losing value with each dilution.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">IonQ Risks Exceed Shareholder Rewards</h2>\n<p>There are many technical barriers to be overcome before IonQ’s technology becomes commercially viable at scale. High error rates and difficulty maintaining coherence make commercialization a much longer-term objective, with developing prototypes and proofs-of-concept far more likely to be at the center of management’s mind. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently poured cold water on the excitement at CES, stating that <em>“</em>useful quantum computers may still be 20–30 years away.” While some argue that this is an exaggeration, from an investor perspective, with uncertain revenues, likely dilution, and high cash burn, there are plenty of reasons to be concerned. </p>\n<p><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">In current market conditions,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ionq/similar-stocks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IonQ has multiple market peers</a></span>,&nbsp;including firms with larger balance sheets and greater resources that could quickly mop up market share. IonQ has made some interesting acquisitions to develop a reputation as a leader in the sector, with a wide range of patents and advanced technology. However, whether this is enough to take on the giants of the tech space remains to be seen.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ionq/similar-stocks\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-1410-1024x334.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1697376\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-1410-1024x334.png 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-1410-300x98.png 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-1410-768x251.png 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-1410.png 1182w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is IonQ Stock a Buy?</h2>\n<p>After a 300% rally, it’s no surprise that many analysts remain cautious about the next few quarters. Many insiders and cautious investors will be tempted to trim their positions after such a run, especially considering the valuation concern. </p>\n<p>Despite the company’s various risks, Wall Street is optimistic about IONQ stock. On TipRanks, the stock carries a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on four Buy, two Hold, and zero Sell ratings over the past three months. Notably, not a single analyst rates IONQ as a Sell.</p>\n<p>Currently, IonQ carries an average price target of $44.20 per share, implying a 12% upside potential from current levels.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ionq/forecast\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"421\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IONQ2-1024x421.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1698175\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IONQ2-1024x421.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IONQ2-300x123.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IONQ2-768x316.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IONQ2.jpg 1271w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ionq/forecast\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"272\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IONQ3-1024x272.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1698176\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IONQ3-1024x272.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IONQ3-300x80.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IONQ3-768x204.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IONQ3.jpg 1222w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ionq/forecast\">See more IONQ analyst ratings</a></strong></figcaption></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">IonQ is Overpriced and Underisked</h2>\n<p>IonQ is undoubtedly an exciting company at the forefront of some amazing technology, but with no clear path to profitability, an uncertain timeline, and a high valuation, it feels too risky a bet for me at current levels.</p>\n<p>The quantum computing potential is vast, but until management can demonstrate its ability to commercialize its products at scale, I’m apprehensive about initiating a long position in IonQ stock after such an extended bull run. I’ll be keeping a watchful eye on how quantum computing develops, intending to bet on a particular horse further into the race. As a reasonably cautious investor, I consider investing in embryonic sectors with any significant weight unwise. I rate this quantum computing pioneer as a Hold until I see more meat on the bone of its market strategy over the coming quarters.</p>\n</body></html>",

And this annual event in Las Vegas brings with it a look at all manner of new and exciting gadgets. Chip stock Intel <a data-ticker=\"INTC\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/intc\">(INTC)</a> will be there, and it is already preparing to go toe to toe with rival Advanced Micro Devices <a data-ticker=\"AMD\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd\">(AMD)</a>.

More specifically, Intel will be showing off the new Core H line, as well as the Core HX lineup for gaming laptops, a particular thrill for PC gamers everywhere.</p>\n<p>However, Intel will have a serious fight on its hands as AMD’s lineup includes not only the Strix Halo, but also the latest versions of the Ryzen 9000X3D processors as well. And, there is even some word that Qualcomm <a data-ticker=\"QCOM\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/qcom\">(QCOM)</a> may have <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/qualcomms-qcom-strategic-moves-and-legal-battle-in-the-face-of-an-ai-era\">something to show</a> at the big event; there is not much advance word about this one, but it is a safe bet that it will have something to show off somewhere at CES.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Rising Popularity at AMD</strong></h2>\n<p>What also will be little help to Intel is that chip buyers are increasingly turning their attention to AMD. A survey from Steam, detailed at <em>Tweaktown</em>, revealed that AMD is “poaching buyers from Intel.” In fact, the survey noted, AMD silicon is now found in 38.73% of Steam PCs. Considering that, back in October, AMD was only 33.77% of the field, that should give Intel serious pause.</p>\n<p>The biggest reason, the report notes, is that Intel’s <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/intel-nasdaqintc-augments-lg-laptops-faces-challenges\">constant issues with desktop processors</a> are coming back to haunt it, and in a very big way. Between the “erosion of faith” caused by faulty processors, and the very real potential of more such problems hitting later, the end result is that users simply trust Intel hardware less than they used to, and are making buying decisions accordingly.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Intel a Buy, Hold or Sell?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on INTC stock based on one Buy, 21 Holds and five Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below.

The company has reported Q4 results that beat Wall Street’s expectations, with revenue of $1.84 billion, a 12% increase year-over-year, and earnings of $0.50 per share, marking a 3.7% rise over analysts’ consensus estimates. Looking to the future, the company anticipates a softer environment in 2025, reflecting the negative impact of a stronger dollar on sales.

Additionally, an ongoing strategy exists to explore a potential sale of the Dockers brand. Conversely, there is a level of confidence within the company about Beyond Yoga’s future, with expectations that the brand could one day achieve a billion-dollar status.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Strong Financial Results Reported</strong></h2>\n<p>The company recently reported strong fourth-quarter financial results, exceeding expectations. <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/levi/financials\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/levi/financials\">Revenue reached $1.84 billion</a>, outperforming predictions by $110 million.

Net income increased to $183 million, up from $127 million in Q4 2023, with adjusted net income at $202 million compared to $179 million the previous year. The company’s<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/levi/earnings\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/levi/earnings\"> earnings per share were $0.50</a>, an increase compared to $0.44 in Q4 2023, beating expectations by $0.02.</p>\n<p>For the full Fiscal year of 2024, reported net revenues stood at $6.4 billion, a 3% increase from FY 2023.

That’s where <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/dividend-stocks\">dividend stocks</a> come in. The best ones offer a steady income stream, with yields that not only beat <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators/inflation-rate\">inflation</a> but also outshine current interest rates<a>.</a></p>\n<p>We’ve opened up the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/\">TipRanks database</a> to find two such dividend stocks – stocks with dividend yields that reach as high as 13%. In addition, the shares we’ll look at here have been tagged by some of Wall Street’s analysts as potential winners for 2025. Let’s give them a closer.</p>\n<p><strong>MFA Financial</strong> <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mfa/forecast\"><strong>MFA</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>First up is a real estate investment trust (REIT), MFA Financial. MFA operates as a specialty finance company, investing shareholder money in residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), as well as other real estate assets. The company conducts its activities through direct purchase of properties and by financing loans on mortgages. MFA’s portfolio totals $10.5 billion, with the largest part, $4.2 billion, being in non-QM residential mortgage loans. In addition, the company has substantial positions in residential transitional loans and single-family rental loans. Together, these three segments make up $8 billion of the company’s investment portfolio.</p>\n<p>Being a REIT, MFA is required by tax regulations to return profits directly to shareholders, and like most of its peers the company uses dividends as a means of compliance. MFA last declared its dividend payment on December 11, and the payout went out on January 31 at a rate of 35 cents per common share. This marked the ninth quarter in a row with the dividend at this level. The $1.40 annualized payment per common share gives a forward yield of 13.3%.</p>\n<p>The company supports its dividend policy through its real estate activities. In the last reported quarter, 3Q24, MFA’s net interest income came to $50.6 million. While up almost 10% year-over-year, this figure missed the forecast by $6.57 million. The company’s bottom line was reported as a non-GAAP EPS of 37 cents. This was 4 cents per share lower than had been expected – but it was also a strong reversal of the 64-cent per share EPS loss reported in 3Q23. MFA’s distributable earnings per share also came to 37 cents, and directly supports the company’s dividend payment.</p>\n<p>In his coverage of this stock for Janney, analyst Jason Stewart explains that he likes MFA for its exposure to MBS assets, as well as its likely trajectory given today’s mortgage market. Stewart says of the company and its position, “Historically, investors have fared well capitalizing on government intervention as non-economic participants in markets. Thematically, investment in the high-quality, liquid agency MBS market at current economic returns is attractive and MFA has been opportunistically growing the agency MBS portfolio. Mortgage spreads are wider than long-term averages and likely to tighten as fixed income volatility declines, driving MFA’s book value higher.&nbsp;MFA shares are trading at a steep discount to current GAAP BVPS and&nbsp;economic BVPS. We expect mid-single-digit growth in BVPS and multiple expansion toward economic book value.”</p>\n<p>Stewart quantifies his position with a Buy rating, and a $14 price target that points toward a one-year upside potential for the stock of 33%. With the dividend return added in, that one-year return may reach as high as 46%. (To watch Stewart’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/jason-stewart\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>This stock gets a Moderate Buy rating from the Street consensus, based on 5 reviews that include 3 Buys and 2 Holds. The shares are priced at $10.50 and their $12.55 average target price implies a 12-month gain of 19.5%.

Specifically, Apple has built up a portfolio of hotels, upscale properties with a focus on maximizing guest rooms. The company’s hotels are spread across 37 states in 86 markets. In all, Apple owns 221 hotels with more than 29,700 guest rooms. Brands in the company’s portfolio include such names as Marriott, Courtyard by Marriott, Hampton by Hilton, and Hyatt House.</p>\n<p>Apple’s properties are widespread. The company has 22 hotels in Florida, 26 in Texas, and another 26 in California. Apple even owns properties in Portland, Maine, and Anchorage, Alaska. The key point: the company’s properties are located in places with strong demand, close access to guest amenities, and a track record of delivering consistent performance.</p>\n<p>Turning to that performance, we find that Apple realized revenues of $378.84 million from its properties in 3Q24. This was up 5.7% year-over-year, although it came in just under expectations, missing by some $800,000. Apple reported funds from operations, a key metric for REITs, of 45 cents per share. This was in line with the forecasts and matched the 3Q23 result.</p>\n<p>Apple’s results were more than strong enough to support the company’s common share dividend, which is paid out monthly rather than quarterly. The dividend for February was declared in January 17 for 8 cents per common share. This annualizes to 96 cents per common share and gives a forward yield of 6.14%.</p>\n<p>This stock has come to the attention of Dany Asad from Bank of America, who sees several reasons for an upbeat view on APLE—starting with the old standby of the real estate market, location. He writes, “We are upgrading Apple Hospitality from Neutral to Buy as 1) location, geographic and segment mix all skew favorably to this select service portfolio, 2) capital needs are limited given the low average age of the assets and 3) its dividend yield is above peers.”</p>\n<p>Getting deeper into the details, the BofA analyst adds, “Apple is one of the most capital efficient companies in our REIT coverage, with capex as a % of revenue at 6% (vs peers at 9%). Its average effective age of hotels of 4-5 years is stable since 2019, meaning low deferred maintenance. High margins, low leverage and lower capex drives attractive Adjusted FFO, a strong and well covered dividend and should allow APLE to go on offense if the hotel M&amp;A environment accelerates in 2025.”</p>\n<p>Asad gives APLE shares a Buy rating and a price target of $17 that suggests a 10% gain on the one-year horizon. With the annualized dividend yield, the total return is likely to exceed 16%. (To watch Asad’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/dany-asad\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Overall, this stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 7 reviews that show a breakdown of 5 to Buy and 2 to Hold. The shares are trading for $15.44 and have an average price target of $17.50, implying a potential one-year gain of 13%.

Mary Ann Bartels, market strategist from Sanctuary Wealth, is doing just this – and she sees a potential ‘Golden Age of Investing’ taking shape over the next few years.</p><div><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Invest with Confidence: </h3><ul><li>Follow <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts\">TipRanks' Top Wall Street Analysts</a> to uncover their success rate and average return. </li><li>Join thousands of data-driven investors – Build your <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/smart-portfolio/holdings\">Smart Portfolio</a> for personalized insights. </li></ul></div>\n<p>Specifically, she believes that the S&amp;P 500 may reach as high as 13,000 by 2030 – which would translate to a gain of 113%. Backing her stance, Bartels says, “We believe this is fundamentally driven by the productivity gains from <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> and a strong U.S. economy, aided by maintaining lower corporate taxes, lower interest rates, and the ongoing stimulus from the Biden Administration’s pieces of legislation that allows companies to continue to post strong earnings growth.”</p>\n<p>Looking at stock market history, Bartels thinks we are in the “early stages of the boom and that the equity market will not peak until 2029-2030.”</p>\n<p>Against this optimistic outlook, some of Wall Street’s top analysts – stock experts rated by <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/\">TipRanks</a> among the upper 5% of their peers – are running with the bullish view and weighing in on the stocks that investors should buy now. These are Buy-rated shares, and these 5-star analysts see double-digit upside in them. Let’s take a closer look.</p>\n<p><strong>Twilio, Inc.</strong> <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/twlo/forecast\"><strong>TWLO</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>We’ll start with Twilio, a tech and software firm operating in the cloud computing world. Twilio’s platform and tools allow its clients to make the best use of their data and their communications, to move their own customers along the path from sales to marketing to growth. The platform adds intelligence and security to customer service at every level, to drive a real-time, personalized experience through customer engagement. It’s business communications and marketing all in one, solving the problems that come along with our digital economy.</p>\n<p>The success of Twilio’s platform can be seen in the numbers it generates. In 2023, the last full year with data available, the company’s software tools facilitated 19.9 billion voice calls, handled 167 billion messages sent or received, sent out 1.9 trillion emails, and verified over 4.8 billion customers. Twilio boasts that more than 300,000 brands trust its platform for customer engagement, including such major names as Shopify, Dell, and AirBnB. Twilio’s stock has seen strong gains recently, and the company has a market cap of almost $23 billion<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>The strong recent gains have come on the strength of Twilio’s AI tools. The company has integrated AI tech into its platform in several modes, most prominently in the form of Assistants that allow users to automate platform functions.</p>\n<p>A quality product and strong demand are typically the ingredients of a successful company, and Twilio has seen both revenues and earnings trend upwards in recent years. The company’s 3Q24 quarterly report, the last released, showed a top line of $1.13 billion, up 10% year-over-year and beating the forecast by $40 million. The EPS figure, $1.02 by non-GAAP measures, was 16 cents per share better than had been expected.</p>\n<p>For 5-star analyst Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs, key points here are Twilio’s record of recent successes and its ability to continue delivering for investors.</p>\n<p>“Following multiple years of growth compression and several strategic actions, we believe Twilio is now hitting an inflection point both in terms of narrative and fundamentals,” Rangan opined. “Twilio’s major cost reduction initiatives and ongoing efficiency measures support strong FCF generation ahead, complemented by our view for an inflecting growth profile. We believe Twilio can observe a positive revision cycle on both top and bottom-line against a conservative initial CY25 guide of +7-8% with usage trends inflecting and growth accelerating to &gt;10% in F2H24 (vs. +7% organic in F1H)… Twilio’s turnaround story is firmly underway with potential for solid upside to Revenue/FCF in CY25 at what we view to be a still compelling entry point of 21x EV/FCF (CY26).”</p>\n<p>Rangan’s comments back up his Buy rating on TWLO shares, while his $185 price target points toward a gain of 26% on the one-year horizon. (To watch Rangan’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/kash-rangan\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Overall, Twilio holds a Moderate Buy consensus rating, derived from 24 recent analyst reviews: 16 Buys, 6 Holds, and 2 Sells. That said, at $148.35, the stock has surpassed its average price target of $136.57, implying a potential 8% downside in the near term. It will be interesting to see whether analysts downgrade their ratings or update their targets shortly.

Semtech specializes in developing chips for use in IoT, mobile devices, and data centers – in short, the company focuses on combining high performance with mobility, backed up by reliable connections to strong data centers. Semtech describes itself as promoting ‘smaller, faster, and smarter electronics,’ meeting the needs of both consumers and businesses.</p>\n<p>Towards this end, Semtech has put together a product line to meet the needs of wireless RF, circuit protection, signal integrity, broadcast video, professional AV, cellular IoT solutions, and power management – all applications involved in mobile connectivity. Semtech’s work is deeply connected to some of the fastest-growing areas in the electronics field, and is at the leading edge of mobile connectivity.</p>\n<p>No tech company can ignore AI, and Semtech has been making moves to enter that rapidly expanding market. The company has put several AI-capable products on the market, mainly for data center networking.</p>\n<p>Semtech cannot compare to the chip industry giants in size – it has a market cap of $5.8 billion – but it has seen both earnings and revenues take an upward trend in recent quarters. The last quarterly report, covering fiscal 3Q25, showed a top line of $236.8 million, up 18% year-over-year and $4.74 million better than had been anticipated. The company’s bottom line figure, a non-GAAP EPS of 26 cents, was 3 cents over expectations. In addition, the company reported record net sales in its data center segment, which were up 58% quarter-over-quarter to reach $43.1 million.</p>\n<p>This stock has caught the eye of UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri, who is rated #8 overall by TipRanks. Arcuri first takes note of Semtech’s connection to AI, writing, “Semtech is an analog company making inroads into AI data center networking thanks to a key content win for SMTC’s CopperEdge product in Nvidia’s Blackwell platform, and Nvidia is pushing hard to ramp a similar fiber product (LPO) later this year. Blackwell’s CopperEdge SAM alone is $100MM, while AMD/hyperscalers and an estimated 30MM annual LPO units should be additive to this. Beyond the data center, Semtech’s other analog businesses should see reasonable smartphone units and what should be a strong year of Industrial cyclical recovery.”</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, the high-ranked analyst goes on to explain why he believes that SMTC shares are primed for gains: “Street estimates for $76/103MM of F25/F26 Signal Integrity segment growth look low (UBSe $212/220MM), while a recent refinancing is not yet reflected in consensus and a possible portfolio rationalization could be the impetus for the market to reconsider Semtech’s valuation. In all, we think estimates and multiples are on their way up…”</p>\n<p>Arcuri puts a Buy rating on Semtech’s stock and complements that with a one-year price target of $85, suggesting a gain of 27.5% for the shares. (To watch Arcuri’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/timothy-arcuri\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>All in all, among 12 recent analyst reviews, the sentiment heavily favors the bulls, with an 11-to-1 split in favor of Buy over Hold, resulting in a Strong Buy consensus rating. Currently trading at $67.69, the stock carries an average price target of $77.70, suggesting a 15% gain over the coming year.

While the company is working on plenty of other titles, there is little doubt that the next <em>GTA</em> is the cash cow for Rockstar Games and its parent company, Take-Two (TTWO). </p>\n<p>However, with a massive reliance on its flagship title remaining and with speculators pushing up the share price in advance of the release, there is little room for error for TTWO’s management. The closer we get to the release date, the more the stock becomes a gamble rather than an investment, so I am cautiously placing a Sell rating on TTWO until further clarity is provided.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>It Take-Two to Tango</strong></h2>\n<p>The firm has a stellar reputation as one of the best gaming companies ever, but I worry that this is built upon only a handful of highly successful franchises. Most will know TTWO because of <em>GTA</em>, but titles like<em> Red Dead Redemption, Mafia,</em> and several NBA games are also under its brand umbrella.</p>\n<p>I’m also concerned about the dependence on franchise games, which can quickly fade as new gamers enter the market. Management has put steps in place to mitigate this by acquiring mobile gaming giant Zynga. However, results have been underwhelming so far. The transition has been problematic, with various integration challenges and struggles to exacerbate the existing intense competition.</p>\n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ttwo/financials\">TTWO has a decent level of revenue diversification</a>, <em>GTA Online </em>remains the major powerhouse driving revenues. The game has been operating for over a decade; a new <em>GTA 6</em> release could undermine this revenue source despite creating a new one. Given the reliance on <em>GTA</em> players, I worry that some market saturation is inevitable. The possibility of the game being a complete flop is also a distinct possibility and is seemingly being ignored by most investors and gaming commentators. Take-Two’s past history and success have raised the bar and expectations, but can the company meet them?</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>TTWO Headed for Gaming Industry Headwinds</strong></h2>\n<p>The gaming industry faces several headwinds, including declining consumer spending and shifting player engagement. This may be improved by a new game release, but gamers are now highly conscious of the aggressive monetization tactics being used by all gaming companies. They may be reluctant to devote as much loose change to these games going forward.</p>\n<p>With a hefty market cap of $33 billion, I have worries that TTWO will struggle to maintain its illustrious performance history. Moreover, delays in development or perceived quality issues before the release date could enormously damage TTWO’s share price. Investing in a company with such sensitivity to consumer sentiment can be perilous.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>GTA Gamer Fatigue Could Scupper TTWO</strong></h2>\n<p>A glance at <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ttwo/earnings\">TTWO’s earnings report </a>shows that management is confident that the current strategy will succeed beyond <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ttwo/earnings\">next week’s major release on February 6th</a>, but I’m not sure there is much evidence to support this. The trends are all moving in the right direction regarding the report, with solid revenue numbers and net bookings on the rise, but I worry that <em>GTA</em> gamer fatigue could set in, dampening long-term sales. Gamers are increasingly skeptical of predatory microtransactions in games, and the regulators are aggressively working against pay-to-win mechanics, which proved to be a significant boost for some releases. Relying on these tactics is not as lucrative as it once was.</p>\n<p>From my perspective, the Zynga acquisition has not proved its worth. At nearly $13 billion, management made this huge move to break into an oversaturated, unpredictable, but highly lucrative market. The synergy management was aiming for between console and mobile experiences has not been realized, raising concerns that this segment could be far less lucrative than TTWO expected.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ttwo/financials/balance-sheet\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"612\" height=\"441\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TTWO3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1692842\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TTWO3.jpg 612w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TTWO3-300x216.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TTWO3-105x77.jpg 105w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\"></a></figure></div>\n<p>At the same time, the company’s broader pipeline has yet to show that it can build reliable blockbuster income from other releases. With operating expenses in the form of development costs soaring each year, I don’t know how much confidence can be put in banking on the longevity of franchises going forward as an investor. Markets have guided for about $982-992 million in expenses for Q2 2025, but this was well over $1 billion in reality, raising further pressure on management to recoup such enormous investments. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Record TTWO Stock Price Leaves Little for New Investors</strong></h2>\n<p>I would suggest caution for existing or potential investors as we get closer to the release of<em> GTA 6. </em>While this will likely be a massive commercial success when released, any development missteps, technical glitches, or consumer backlash could be a disaster for the company’s financials. </p>\n<p>The broader sector is seeing a general downturn as people struggle with a rising cost of living. Even such a cultural juggernaut may struggle to garner much momentum, especially if the cost of the game is potentially over $100, as many are reporting. </p>\n<p>With a <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ttwo/financials\">P/S ratio of 5.97</a>, elevated earnings expectations are already reflected in the share price. With profits sliding of late, the company is now severely in the red, and I fear that investors may not stick around if the <em>GTA</em> bonanza fails to be the silver bullet many are hoping for.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ttwo/financials/income-statement\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"395\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TTWO2-1-1024x395.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1692833\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TTWO2-1-1024x395.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TTWO2-1-300x116.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TTWO2-1-768x296.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TTWO2-1.jpg 1233w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Take-Two (TTWO) a Good Stock to Buy Now?</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite my bearish stance, most Wall Street analysts are expecting an upward re-rating of TTWO over the next 12 months. Currently, 17 analysts are rating TTWO as a Buy; one analyst considers it a Hold, while zero analysts have rated TTWO as a Sell. The average price target on TTWO stock is $205.83 per share, equating to around 8.2% upside potential over the next 12 months.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ttwo/forecast\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TTWO4-1024x349.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1692852\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TTWO4-1024x349.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TTWO4-300x102.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TTWO4-768x262.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TTWO4.jpg 1235w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure></div>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ttwo/forecast\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"269\" src=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TTWO5-1024x269.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1692855\" srcset=\"https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TTWO5-1024x269.jpg 1024w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TTWO5-300x79.jpg 300w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TTWO5-768x202.jpg 768w, https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TTWO5.jpg 1229w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ttwo/forecast\">See more TTWO analyst ratings</a></strong></figcaption></figure></div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Take-Two Faces Precarious 2025 as Expectations Mount</strong></h2>\n<p>I fully expect the next few years to be exciting for Take-Two, with some genuinely excellent anticipated releases. However, from an investor perspective, many of TTWO’s endearing features have been highlighted multiple times, but its risks have not. </p>\n<p>With so much speculation surrounding the stock and so many things that could spoil the party, sentiment is brittle. Given the heightened uncertainty, cautious investors will seek better opportunities elsewhere. In contrast, risk-tolerant investors may want some exposure to one of the most significant cultural events in modern entertainment history despite the share price trading at just under all-time highs of around $200 per share.</p>\n</body></html>",
