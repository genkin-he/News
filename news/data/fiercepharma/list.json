            "description": "<div class=\"row media-content-body article-body mb-lg-4\" id=\"article-body-row\">\n<div class=\"col content\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the fourth time in five months, the Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority (PMCPA) has <a href=\"https://www.pmcpa.org.uk/cases/completed-cases/auth3815823-complainant-v-moderna/\">ruled</a> that Moderna brought discredit on the pharma industry. Moderna received the latest telling-off after the U.K. drug marketing watchdog reviewed social media posts and other materials related to the NextCOVE clinical trial of its COVID-19 vaccine.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A complainant shared four third-party posts on X (formerly Twitter) and two online articles with the PMCPA to make the case that Moderna had breached the U.K. marketing code. Initially, the PMCPA panel sided with Moderna on key points, including the question of whether the biotech had brought discredit on the industry but the complainant secured a different result on appeal.</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[300,250]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"10\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot1Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-1_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“The Appeal Board was concerned about the level of oversight that Moderna was able to demonstrate in relation to third parties,” the PMCPA said. “The use of the photograph of the schoolgirl with a teddy bear and certificate, along with the language encouraging children to take part in the vaccine trial were unacceptable (Tweet B) and reflected poorly on the industry.”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :class=\"{ 'mobile-ad': false }\" :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"false\" :hide-on-mobile=\"false\" :randomize-element-id=\"true\" :sizes=\"[['fluid']]\" ad-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" class=\"inline-native-ad pos-14\" placeholder-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" pos=\"14\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos3\"></div>\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :hide-on-desktop=\"0\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :out-of-page=\"true\" :pos=\"8\" ad-id=\"contentEmbedOne\" placeholder-id=\"content-embed-one\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tweet B, which was published by a patient recruitment center, contained two photos. One snap showed the schoolgirl referenced by the appeal board. The other photo showed the same child with a woman assumed to be the child’s mother or caregiver and a man who appeared to be a health professional. A reply to the post said, “If you want to take part and are over the age of 12, please get in touch.”</p>\n<div class=\"t1-ad-slot\" data-ad-slot-id=\"38\"></div>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"5818e276-8514-4d61-8faf-8c011ec014d8\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/marketing/moderna-blamed-after-kids-offered-2000-participate-covid-19-vaccine-trial\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">Moderna blamed after kids offered $2,000 to participate in COVID-19 vaccine trial</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The appeal board took issue with the text, concluding that the “emphasis on ‘you’ being ‘over the age of 12’ with the image of the girl holding a teddy bear and certificate meant that the post was inappropriately directed at children.” That conclusion led the board to rule that high standards had not been maintained.</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"11\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot2Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-2_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Across the original ruling and appeal conclusions, the PMCPA also found the materials made misleading claims and failed to clearly disclose Moderna’s role and involvement in the trial. Factoring in breaches across two Twitter posts and a linked article, the watchdog ruled Moderna had brought discredit upon and reduced confidence in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The ruling is the fourth time in quick succession that the PMCPA has found Moderna brought discredit on the industry, denoting violations of Clause 2 of its code of practice. The sequence began with another case about Moderna’s NextCOVE COVID-19 vaccine trial. In that case, the watchdog <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/moderna-blamed-after-kids-offered-2000-participate-covid-19-vaccine-trial\">took</a> Moderna to task for an unapproved WhatsApp message that offered children 1,500 pounds sterling ($1,900) to participate in the trial.</p>\n<p>Moderna’s other two recent serious breaches of the marketing code relate to meetings of health professionals. In separate rulings, the PMCPA concluded that the biotech had <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/moderna-rebuked-over-second-successive-spikevax-marketing-breach\">promoted</a> its COVID-19 vaccine in a presentation and “<a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/moderna-novo-nordisk-slammed-breaching-uk-drug-marketing-code-yet-again\">had</a>, in effect, made a payment to a U.K. health professional to attend a promotional meeting.” </p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>",

As Narasimhan shared during the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on Jan. 14, Kisqali reached 52% in new-to-brand market share in early breast cancer within three months of the launch.</p>\n<div class=\"t1-ad-slot\" data-ad-slot-id=\"38\"></div>\n<p>In early-stage breast cancer, Kisqali is going toe to toe with Eli Lilly’s rival CDK4/6 inhibitor Verzenio. While Verzenio’s adjuvant use is limited to node-positive tumors, Kisqali’s label also <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/novartis-heaps-pressure-lilly-broad-fda-approval-kisqali-early-breast-cancer\" target=\"_blank\">covers</a> those with node-negative (N0) disease.</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"11\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot2Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-2_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p>As the launch has progressed, the biggest points of discussion among market watchers have centered on how much market share Kisqali can steal from Verzenio and the willingness of doctors to more proactively treat node-negative patients. These patients are perceived to have a lower risk of progression compared with those with nodal involvement.</p>\n<p>“The biggest focus for us right now is maximizing the opportunity in the node-0 and node-1 patients without risk factors, where Kisqali is uniquely labeled and our competitors are not, and our ability to get those patients diagnosed and then ultimately on therapy,” Narasimhan said on a separate investor call Friday.</p>\n<p>In the early days of the launch, the majority of the new patient starts came from patients whom Verzenio can’t reach, Novartis’ U.S. president Victor Bulto said during an interview at the Fierce JPM Week on Jan. 14.</p>\n<p>While this is a positive indicator for the launch, the coin has two sides. The fast adoption in the non-overlapping population indicates Novartis is expanding the market, but it could also suggest that Kisqali is not doing so well at taking Verzenio’s share in the drugs’ shared patient population.</p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10\"></div>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"b47556a1-b184-4401-837a-6e5cdb74898d\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/pharma/standing-alone-novartis-bumps-its-growth-projection-through-end-decade\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">Novartis, after slimming down, boosts growth projection through the end of the decade</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>This situation, if confirmed, could draw a comparison to the PARP inhibitor market dynamics in first-line ovarian cancer. While GSK’s Zejula boasts a broad biomarker-agnostic label, it has mostly only been able to reach patients with certain non-mutated tumors. Although these patients account for half of the dru’s eligible patients, they’ve also been associated with low overall interest in using a PARP inhibitor. As a result, despite a narrower label, AstraZeneca and Merck’s Lynparza has remained king by hogging the more receptive BRCA-mutated subgroup.</p>\n<p>There are some differences between the PARP and CDK4/6 classes. In the PARP class, Lynparza was the first-to-market drug with several years to establish its presence. Conversely, CDK4/6 meds Kisqali and Verzenio arrived in the same year, even though Verzenio held the lone adjuvant indication for some time.</p>\n<p>Importantly, Kisqali boasts overall survival data seen across three phase 3 trials in the metastatic setting. Verzenio previously <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/handing-novartis-win-lilly-verzenio-barely-misses-overall-survival-goal-first-line-breast\">narrowly missed</a> an overall survival showing in first-line breast cancer.</p>\n<p>“I do believe that through the discussions we’ve had with most of the prescribers, they’ll go and have one CDK4/6 of choice across the spectrum,” Bulto said.</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"de956555-b1a1-4109-95a8-9162eb01af85\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/marketing/novartis-1st-super-bowl-ad-aims-create-movement-breast-cancer-awareness-blitz\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">Novartis' first Super Bowl ad aims to 'create a movement' with breast cancer awareness blitz</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>As Narasimhan and Bulto stressed, it's still too early in the launch to draw any long-term conclusions. One possible explanation for the initial adoption of Kisqali in the non-overlapping population might be found in the small number of doctors who have been waiting for a node-negative option.</p>\n<p>“I also want to caution [that] we’re learning […] who are the adopters, and we have to see whether these are first adopters in the academic centers, or this is diffusing more into the community,” Bulto said.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Novartis has maintained that Kisqali holds potential to reap $4 billion in peak sales in the adjuvant setting alone, or $8 billion altogether with its metastatic use. During Friday’s media call, Narasimhan said it’s still too early to break out the adjuvant projection by nodal stage.</p>\n<p>“We continue to believe this […] could be one of the largest medicines in Novartis history,” Narasimhan said. </p>\n</div>\n</div>",

Still, questions continue to swirl about an evolving market showdown with Regeneron’s rival drug.</p>\n<p>Vabysmo has supplanted cancer immunotherapy Tecentriq to take the No. 3 spot on Roche’s annual sales ranking. The bispecific eye injection brought in 3.86 billion Swiss francs ($4.3 billion), including 1.05 billion Swiss francs in the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[300,250]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"10\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot1Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-1_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p>Despite 43% year-over-year growth, Vabysmo’s fourth-quarter sales missed analyst expectations by 2%, according to Intron Health.

The numbers were 30%, 22% and 20%, respectively, in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>Graham stressed that Vabysmo’s fourth-quarter share numbers were not directly comparable to previous quarters because a data aggregator recently issued a “restatement” of third-quarter share figures. If analyzed by prior metrics, Vabysmo expanded by roughly three percentage points across the three indications, she said.</p>\n<p>Lately, the competition between Vabysmo and a high-dose version of Regeneron’s Eylea has been the focus of industry watchers. In September, European regulators also approved a prefilled syringe of Eylea HD. Nevertheless, Roche is “really not seeing any impact in any part of the world” from the arrival of Eylea HD, Graham said.</p>\n<p>The Roche exec highlighted how the two products’ syringes are “materially different,” as the Vabysmo product offers one-hand administration, she said. </p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10\"></div>\n<p>“When you think about it, if you’re doing […] 100 shots a day, having that really ease of administration is super important,” she added. “I would say we definitely have device preference going on our side.”</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"04b47db6-3b20-45ea-8d38-2ad81b94e0a7\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/pharma/regeneron-ceo-says-its-needs-more-arrows-quiver-disappointing-eylea-hd\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">JPM25: Regeneron CEO says it needs more 'arrows in its quiver' as Eylea HD sales fall short</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>As for Tecentriq, sales of the PD-L1 inhibitor declined by 3.3%—or remained flat at constant exchange rates—last year.</p>\n<p>“We do believe, as we have mentioned previously, that Tecentriq is getting close to peak, and we expect sales growth to be in the zero to low-single-digit range going forward,” Graham said.</p>\n<p>In 2024, Roche welcomed antibody-drug conjugate Polivy to the blockbuster club. With full-year sales of 1.12 billion Swiss francs, the drug ranked 16th on the company’s list of top meds.</p>\n<p>Although Polivy’s fourth-quarter sales, at 304 million Swiss francs, were flat over the prior quarter and came in 6% below Wall Street’s estimates, the drug expanded its U.S. market share in the key first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma indication to 29%, according to Graham.</p>\n<p>Roche has increasingly been leaning on new drugs like Vabysmo for growth.

            "description": "<div class=\"row media-content-body article-body mb-lg-4\" id=\"article-body-row\">\n<div class=\"col content\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Want the eyeballs of people with obesity? Think TV. That is a takeaway from a CMI Media Group survey that <a href=\"https://cmimediagroup.com/resources/media-vitals-2024-2025/?utm_source=online&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=MV-Consumer-Scoop\">suggests</a> the fight for attention will be waged on traditional marketing battlegrounds, with TV emerging as the best way for pharmas to reach people with obesity and Facebook still reigning supreme in the social media space.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Marketers have more ways than ever to reach patients, but the survey of 579 people who self-identified as having obesity shows that the classics are still in style. TV topped the list of media channels, with 76% of respondents telling CMI they watch it at least once a week. Email and social media came in second and third, respectively, with 74% and 70% weekly users in the survey sample.</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[300,250]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"10\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot1Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-1_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How people watch TV has changed, though, with paid and free streaming the most common methods. Paid cable TV and free TV via antenna were a distant third and fourth, with less than half the number of users as paid streaming. CMI found comedy, drama and action/adventure are the most popular genres for the group.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :class=\"{ 'mobile-ad': false }\" :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"false\" :hide-on-mobile=\"false\" :randomize-element-id=\"true\" :sizes=\"[['fluid']]\" ad-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" class=\"inline-native-ad pos-14\" placeholder-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" pos=\"14\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos3\"></div>\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :hide-on-desktop=\"0\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :out-of-page=\"true\" :pos=\"8\" ad-id=\"contentEmbedOne\" placeholder-id=\"content-embed-one\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The survey data on what people with obesity watch—and how they access the video content—informed recommendations by Brittany Hernandez, associate director of video strategy and investment at CMI.</p>\n<div class=\"t1-ad-slot\" data-ad-slot-id=\"38\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“By leveraging targeted video campaigns on paid streaming services like Hulu or Peacock, pharma brands can maximize their ad dollars, investing where the highest number of obesity patients are tuning into,” Hernandez said in the report. “Pharma advertisers should also explore robust sponsorships surrounding comedic and dramatic genres, engaging and resonating with patients in the content they watch most.”</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"11\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot2Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-2_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"690cfabb-e962-4b9a-9853-1306a9ea96cb\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/marketing/ozempics-biggest-night-glp-1s-back-hollywood-spotlight-lilly-backed-2025-golden-globes\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">‘Ozempic’s biggest night’: GLP-1s back in Hollywood spotlight at 2025 Golden Globes</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Social media is another widely used channel. And while upstarts such as TikTok dominate the news, the survey suggests Facebook is the first port of call for the vast majority of people with obesity. CMI found 83% of social media users look at Facebook at least once a week, putting it well ahead of YouTube (63%) and Instagram (43%) in the rankings.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The data collected from 107 caregivers are a little different, with email and search topping TV on the list of their most-used channels and with YouTube sneaking ahead of Facebook on the social media rankings. There is value in factoring caregivers into marketing campaigns, the survey suggested, because they are more likely than patients to ask doctors about the drug ads they see.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another section of the survey points to the types of messages that might resonate with patients. Obesity patients can have issues accessing care, the survey found, leading Toby Katcher, senior vice president of video strategy and investment at CMI, to advise pharma brands to “emphasize accessibility, recognizing that many patients have transportation and financial challenges.” </p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>",
