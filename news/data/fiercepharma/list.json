For 2024, the pharma giant reported 31.4 billion pound sterling in total revenue, a 7% increase at constant exchange rates.</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[300,250]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"10\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot1Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-1_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p>The new target is an increase from the company’s 38 billion pound sterling projection, <a href=\"https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/gsk-tips-12-blockbuster-launches-soften-hiv-patent-loss-power-sales-toward-50b\">announced</a> last year, or its 33 billion pound sterling forecast in 2021, when GSK <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/gsk-shoots-for-46b-2031-sales-post-consumer-health-spinoff-but-will-ceo-walmsley-be-around\">transformed</a> into a pure-play drugmaker by spinning off its consumer health franchise into Haleon.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :class=\"{ 'mobile-ad': false }\" :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"false\" :hide-on-mobile=\"false\" :randomize-element-id=\"true\" :sizes=\"[['fluid']]\" ad-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" class=\"inline-native-ad pos-14\" placeholder-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" pos=\"14\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos3\"></div>\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :hide-on-desktop=\"0\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :out-of-page=\"true\" :pos=\"8\" ad-id=\"contentEmbedOne\" placeholder-id=\"content-embed-one\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p>The latest increase reflects the revival of the once-withdrawn antibody-drug conjugate Blenrep, as well as “multiple launch opportunities in the ’26-to-’31 period,” GSK CEO Emma Walmsley said on a Wednesday call with investors.</p>\n<div class=\"t1-ad-slot\" data-ad-slot-id=\"38\"></div>\n<p>After two back-to-back phase 3 wins in second-line multiple myeloma, GSK has re-adopted a projection that Blenrep’s peak sales could <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/market-withdrawal-back-ps3b-peak-sales-gsk-dreams-big-myeloma-adc-blenrep\" target=\"_blank\">exceed 3 billion pound sterling</a>.

Now, the BCMA-directed ADC expects an FDA decision for its second-line use by July 23 of this year. GSK has recently launched a phase 3 trial, Dreamm-10, in the first-line setting, with headline results expected toward the end of 2027, chief commercial officer Luke Miels said on the call.</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"685b02e8-5406-49de-97d9-2223fe2bd51a\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/pharma/survival-win-against-jjs-darzalex-gsk-bolsters-case-return-myeloma-adc-blenrep\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">ASH: With survival win against J&amp;J's Darzalex, GSK bolsters case for return of myeloma ADC Blenrep</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The addition of Blenrep, plus over 4 billion pound sterling in combined peak sales from Nucala and the near-market long-acting IL-5 drug <a href=\"https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/gsks-depemokimab-reduces-polyps-phase-3-trials-adding-weight-upcoming-filing\">depemokimab</a>, will help boost the contribution of GSK's specialty medicines portfolio to more than 50% of the company’s overall top line, according to Walmsley.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the rise of therapeutics comes in stark contrast to the struggles that GSK’s vaccines business is navigating.</p>\n<p>After a blockbuster burst onto the market last year, sales of the RSV vaccine Arexvy nosedived this season. In a similar pattern already <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/gsk-tries-steady-ship-arexvy-sales-plummeted-amid-unfavorable-vaccination-policies\" target=\"_blank\">seen in the third quarter</a>, Arexvy sales in the fourth quarter plummeted by 70% year over year to 158 million pound sterling ($198 million), landing 32% below analysts’ expectations.</p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10\"></div>\n<p>Arexvy remains the RSV vaccine market leader, but demand was lower this year because of a restricted recommendation from the CDC, plus a late RSV season and an unfavorable comparison to launch stocking in 2023, Miels explained. On Tuesday, Pfizer also <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/pfizer-harnesses-covid-waves-cinch-q4-gains-while-rsv-vaccine-sales-stumble\">reported</a> $198 million in fourth-quarter sales for its RSV shot Abrysvo.</p>\n<p>For 2025, GSK doesn’t expect the age restrictions in the CDC’s restricted RSV immunization recommendation will change.</p>\n<p>Also in vaccines, GSK’s star Shingles vaccine Shingrix saw sales drop 4% at constant exchange rates to 848 million pound sterling ($1.06 billion) in the last three months of 2024.</p>\n<p>An overall vaccines market slowdown in China has recently struck a nerve with investors. On Tuesday, Merck &amp; Co. said it’s temporarily <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/merck-puts-temporary-kibosh-gardasil-shipments-china-local-demand-hpv-vaccine-nosedives\" target=\"_blank\">suspending shipments</a> of its HPV vaccine Gardasil to China so that it and its partner Chongqing Zhifei Biological Products can work through an inventory backlog. Disappointing prospects of the shot sent Merck’s stock price down by about 10% Tuesday morning.</p>\n<p>GSK is also partnered with Zhifei on Shingrix. On Wednesday’s GSK call, Miels acknowledged the short-term headwinds in China as well as a low expectation for Shingrix in the country in 2025. But he stressed that the company is there for a “mid- to longer-term play,” while Walmsley said that none of the short-term pressure “takes away from our longer-term ambition” for the shot.</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"e5f75794-89df-477e-8562-bd10283bff7e\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/pharma/merck-puts-temporary-kibosh-gardasil-shipments-china-local-demand-hpv-vaccine-nosedives\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">Merck halts Gardasil shipments to China, withdraws $11B sales target as demand nosedives</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>GSK has adjusted expectations for both Arexvy and Shingrix in its 2031 sales target, although Walmsley said she expects vaccines to “remain a key source of future growth” for the firm.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, another pillar of GSK’s business, HIV drugs, delivered nearly 2 billion pound sterling ($2.5 billion) in fourth-quarter sales, good for 11% growth year over year. The long-acting injectable treatment Cabenuva and PrEP drug Apretude played a role in the growth.</p>\n<p>With the new sales target set and pipeline progressing, GSK on Tuesday also announced a 2 billion-pound sterling share buyback program to be implemented over the next 18 months.</p>\n<p>“We believe this offers a very attractive return for shareholders at current share price levels,” Walmsley said. “Very importantly, and to reconfirm, we will maintain planned increased levels of investment in R&amp;D, new launches and targeted business development alongside these share buybacks.”</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"row media-content-body article-body mb-lg-4\" id=\"article-body-row\">\n<div class=\"col content\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the fourth time in five months, the Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority (PMCPA) has <a href=\"https://www.pmcpa.org.uk/cases/completed-cases/auth3815823-complainant-v-moderna/\">ruled</a> that Moderna brought discredit on the pharma industry. Moderna received the latest telling-off after the U.K. drug marketing watchdog reviewed social media posts and other materials related to the NextCOVE clinical trial of its COVID-19 vaccine.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A complainant shared four third-party posts on X (formerly Twitter) and two online articles with the PMCPA to make the case that Moderna had breached the U.K. marketing code. Initially, the PMCPA panel sided with Moderna on key points, including the question of whether the biotech had brought discredit on the industry but the complainant secured a different result on appeal.</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[300,250]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"10\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot1Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-1_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“The Appeal Board was concerned about the level of oversight that Moderna was able to demonstrate in relation to third parties,” the PMCPA said. “The use of the photograph of the schoolgirl with a teddy bear and certificate, along with the language encouraging children to take part in the vaccine trial were unacceptable (Tweet B) and reflected poorly on the industry.”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :class=\"{ 'mobile-ad': false }\" :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"false\" :hide-on-mobile=\"false\" :randomize-element-id=\"true\" :sizes=\"[['fluid']]\" ad-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" class=\"inline-native-ad pos-14\" placeholder-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" pos=\"14\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos3\"></div>\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :hide-on-desktop=\"0\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :out-of-page=\"true\" :pos=\"8\" ad-id=\"contentEmbedOne\" placeholder-id=\"content-embed-one\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tweet B, which was published by a patient recruitment center, contained two photos. One snap showed the schoolgirl referenced by the appeal board. The other photo showed the same child with a woman assumed to be the child’s mother or caregiver and a man who appeared to be a health professional. A reply to the post said, “If you want to take part and are over the age of 12, please get in touch.”</p>\n<div class=\"t1-ad-slot\" data-ad-slot-id=\"38\"></div>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"5818e276-8514-4d61-8faf-8c011ec014d8\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/marketing/moderna-blamed-after-kids-offered-2000-participate-covid-19-vaccine-trial\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">Moderna blamed after kids offered $2,000 to participate in COVID-19 vaccine trial</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The appeal board took issue with the text, concluding that the “emphasis on ‘you’ being ‘over the age of 12’ with the image of the girl holding a teddy bear and certificate meant that the post was inappropriately directed at children.” That conclusion led the board to rule that high standards had not been maintained.</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"11\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot2Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-2_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Across the original ruling and appeal conclusions, the PMCPA also found the materials made misleading claims and failed to clearly disclose Moderna’s role and involvement in the trial. Factoring in breaches across two Twitter posts and a linked article, the watchdog ruled Moderna had brought discredit upon and reduced confidence in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The ruling is the fourth time in quick succession that the PMCPA has found Moderna brought discredit on the industry, denoting violations of Clause 2 of its code of practice. The sequence began with another case about Moderna’s NextCOVE COVID-19 vaccine trial. In that case, the watchdog <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/moderna-blamed-after-kids-offered-2000-participate-covid-19-vaccine-trial\">took</a> Moderna to task for an unapproved WhatsApp message that offered children 1,500 pounds sterling ($1,900) to participate in the trial.</p>\n<p>Moderna’s other two recent serious breaches of the marketing code relate to meetings of health professionals. In separate rulings, the PMCPA concluded that the biotech had <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/moderna-rebuked-over-second-successive-spikevax-marketing-breach\">promoted</a> its COVID-19 vaccine in a presentation and “<a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/moderna-novo-nordisk-slammed-breaching-uk-drug-marketing-code-yet-again\">had</a>, in effect, made a payment to a U.K. health professional to attend a promotional meeting.” </p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>",

As Narasimhan shared during the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on Jan. 14, Kisqali reached 52% in new-to-brand market share in early breast cancer within three months of the launch.</p>\n<div class=\"t1-ad-slot\" data-ad-slot-id=\"38\"></div>\n<p>In early-stage breast cancer, Kisqali is going toe to toe with Eli Lilly’s rival CDK4/6 inhibitor Verzenio. While Verzenio’s adjuvant use is limited to node-positive tumors, Kisqali’s label also <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/novartis-heaps-pressure-lilly-broad-fda-approval-kisqali-early-breast-cancer\" target=\"_blank\">covers</a> those with node-negative (N0) disease.</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"11\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot2Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-2_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p>As the launch has progressed, the biggest points of discussion among market watchers have centered on how much market share Kisqali can steal from Verzenio and the willingness of doctors to more proactively treat node-negative patients. These patients are perceived to have a lower risk of progression compared with those with nodal involvement.</p>\n<p>“The biggest focus for us right now is maximizing the opportunity in the node-0 and node-1 patients without risk factors, where Kisqali is uniquely labeled and our competitors are not, and our ability to get those patients diagnosed and then ultimately on therapy,” Narasimhan said on a separate investor call Friday.</p>\n<p>In the early days of the launch, the majority of the new patient starts came from patients whom Verzenio can’t reach, Novartis’ U.S. president Victor Bulto said during an interview at the Fierce JPM Week on Jan. 14.</p>\n<p>While this is a positive indicator for the launch, the coin has two sides. The fast adoption in the non-overlapping population indicates Novartis is expanding the market, but it could also suggest that Kisqali is not doing so well at taking Verzenio’s share in the drugs’ shared patient population.</p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10\"></div>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"b47556a1-b184-4401-837a-6e5cdb74898d\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/pharma/standing-alone-novartis-bumps-its-growth-projection-through-end-decade\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">Novartis, after slimming down, boosts growth projection through the end of the decade</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>This situation, if confirmed, could draw a comparison to the PARP inhibitor market dynamics in first-line ovarian cancer. While GSK’s Zejula boasts a broad biomarker-agnostic label, it has mostly only been able to reach patients with certain non-mutated tumors. Although these patients account for half of the dru’s eligible patients, they’ve also been associated with low overall interest in using a PARP inhibitor. As a result, despite a narrower label, AstraZeneca and Merck’s Lynparza has remained king by hogging the more receptive BRCA-mutated subgroup.</p>\n<p>There are some differences between the PARP and CDK4/6 classes. In the PARP class, Lynparza was the first-to-market drug with several years to establish its presence. Conversely, CDK4/6 meds Kisqali and Verzenio arrived in the same year, even though Verzenio held the lone adjuvant indication for some time.</p>\n<p>Importantly, Kisqali boasts overall survival data seen across three phase 3 trials in the metastatic setting. Verzenio previously <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/handing-novartis-win-lilly-verzenio-barely-misses-overall-survival-goal-first-line-breast\">narrowly missed</a> an overall survival showing in first-line breast cancer.</p>\n<p>“I do believe that through the discussions we’ve had with most of the prescribers, they’ll go and have one CDK4/6 of choice across the spectrum,” Bulto said.</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"de956555-b1a1-4109-95a8-9162eb01af85\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/marketing/novartis-1st-super-bowl-ad-aims-create-movement-breast-cancer-awareness-blitz\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">Novartis' first Super Bowl ad aims to 'create a movement' with breast cancer awareness blitz</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>As Narasimhan and Bulto stressed, it's still too early in the launch to draw any long-term conclusions. One possible explanation for the initial adoption of Kisqali in the non-overlapping population might be found in the small number of doctors who have been waiting for a node-negative option.</p>\n<p>“I also want to caution [that] we’re learning […] who are the adopters, and we have to see whether these are first adopters in the academic centers, or this is diffusing more into the community,” Bulto said.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Novartis has maintained that Kisqali holds potential to reap $4 billion in peak sales in the adjuvant setting alone, or $8 billion altogether with its metastatic use. During Friday’s media call, Narasimhan said it’s still too early to break out the adjuvant projection by nodal stage.</p>\n<p>“We continue to believe this […] could be one of the largest medicines in Novartis history,” Narasimhan said. </p>\n</div>\n</div>",

Still, questions continue to swirl about an evolving market showdown with Regeneron’s rival drug.</p>\n<p>Vabysmo has supplanted cancer immunotherapy Tecentriq to take the No. 3 spot on Roche’s annual sales ranking. The bispecific eye injection brought in 3.86 billion Swiss francs ($4.3 billion), including 1.05 billion Swiss francs in the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[300,250]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"10\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot1Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-1_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p>Despite 43% year-over-year growth, Vabysmo’s fourth-quarter sales missed analyst expectations by 2%, according to Intron Health. The performance came after several quarters of <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/roche-sees-no-material-impact-eylea-biosim-surprise-elevidys-dmd-gene-therapy-beat\" target=\"_blank\">Street-beating sales</a> for the drug.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :class=\"{ 'mobile-ad': false }\" :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"false\" :hide-on-mobile=\"false\" :randomize-element-id=\"true\" :sizes=\"[['fluid']]\" ad-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" class=\"inline-native-ad pos-14\" placeholder-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" pos=\"14\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos3\"></div>\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :hide-on-desktop=\"0\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :out-of-page=\"true\" :pos=\"8\" ad-id=\"contentEmbedOne\" placeholder-id=\"content-embed-one\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p>During an investor call Thursday, Roche’s pharma chief Teresa Graham suggested that the fourth-quarter haul was affected by a “spend-down” and “significant channel filling” right after the launch of a more convenient prefilled syringe version of Vabysmo, which was approved by the FDA in July and EU in December.</p>\n<div class=\"t1-ad-slot\" data-ad-slot-id=\"38\"></div>\n<p>Starting in January, Roche is seeing “a strong trajectory” for Vabysmo sales, Graham said, assuring investors of continued strong growth and further market-share expansion in 2025.</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"11\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot2Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-2_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p>Vabysmo’s market share in the U.S. in the fourth quarter was 31% in neovascular age-related macular degeneration, 22% in diabetic macular edema and 23% in retinal vein occlusion. The numbers were 30%, 22% and 20%, respectively, in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>Graham stressed that Vabysmo’s fourth-quarter share numbers were not directly comparable to previous quarters because a data aggregator recently issued a “restatement” of third-quarter share figures. If analyzed by prior metrics, Vabysmo expanded by roughly three percentage points across the three indications, she said.</p>\n<p>Lately, the competition between Vabysmo and a high-dose version of Regeneron’s Eylea has been the focus of industry watchers. In September, European regulators also approved a prefilled syringe of Eylea HD. Nevertheless, Roche is “really not seeing any impact in any part of the world” from the arrival of Eylea HD, Graham said.</p>\n<p>The Roche exec highlighted how the two products’ syringes are “materially different,” as the Vabysmo product offers one-hand administration, she said. </p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10\"></div>\n<p>“When you think about it, if you’re doing […] 100 shots a day, having that really ease of administration is super important,” she added. “I would say we definitely have device preference going on our side.”</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"04b47db6-3b20-45ea-8d38-2ad81b94e0a7\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/pharma/regeneron-ceo-says-its-needs-more-arrows-quiver-disappointing-eylea-hd\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">JPM25: Regeneron CEO says it needs more 'arrows in its quiver' as Eylea HD sales fall short</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>As for Tecentriq, sales of the PD-L1 inhibitor declined by 3.3%—or remained flat at constant exchange rates—last year.</p>\n<p>“We do believe, as we have mentioned previously, that Tecentriq is getting close to peak, and we expect sales growth to be in the zero to low-single-digit range going forward,” Graham said.</p>\n<p>In 2024, Roche welcomed antibody-drug conjugate Polivy to the blockbuster club. With full-year sales of 1.12 billion Swiss francs, the drug ranked 16th on the company’s list of top meds.</p>\n<p>Although Polivy’s fourth-quarter sales, at 304 million Swiss francs, were flat over the prior quarter and came in 6% below Wall Street’s estimates, the drug expanded its U.S. market share in the key first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma indication to 29%, according to Graham.</p>\n<p>Roche has increasingly been leaning on new drugs like Vabysmo for growth. In 2024, a “young portfolio” of drugs contributed to 56% of Roche’s 46.2 billion Swiss francs of pharma sales, up from 51% in 2023.</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"5aefefc5-5f3b-4ba8-96e2-45eb359821ff\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/pharma/roche-projected-win-2025-drug-sales-novo-and-lilly-continue-climb-rankings-evaluate\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">Roche projected to claim pharma's 2025 sales crown as Novo, Lilly climb rankings: Evaluate</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>On Thursday’s call, Roche CEO Thomas Schinecker highlighted 12 key pivotal trial readouts, including from four new molecular entities, that could happen in 2025.</p>\n<p>One of the key assets is giredestrant.

Forty-five minutes before Robert F.

The bipartisan survey of 1,564 registered voters nationwide <a href=\"https://cf43a83bc1df.usrfiles.com/ugd/b11210_b2232d6f55774cc487622039ece9342d.pdf\">revealed</a> (PDF) public support for vaccines. More than 70% of respondents expressed favorable views toward vaccines, with 43% of people saying they view the shots very favorably.

Americans understand the benefits of vaccines in safeguarding our children and communities.”</p>\n<div class=\"t1-ad-slot\" data-ad-slot-id=\"38\"></div>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"641e9148-f44d-4597-b95d-b229010df8c8\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/pharma/around-world-vaccine-stocks-sag-after-rfk-jrs-hhs-appointment\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">Vaccine stocks sag in US, Europe after RFK Jr.'s HHS appointment</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Americans have favorable views of vaccines because they believe the benefits outweigh the risks. Almost three-quarters of people said vaccines have a favorable risk-benefit profile and that they sometimes or always get shots recommended by their doctor. Again, the number of people who get vaccines recommended by their doctor was higher among respondents with children.</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"11\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot2Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-2_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Almost three-quarters of people said ensuring FDA-approved vaccines are widely available in the U.S. should be a high priority. Similar levels of people said they thought vaccines should be required for children to attend school and were concerned about falling childhood vaccination rates. Opposition to the HHS revoking vaccine approvals was similarly widespread.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Americans rely on doctors for opinions on vaccines—with 78% of people saying they give at least some weight to the views of physicians—and see long-term scientific studies and recommendations from their healthcare providers as the most trusted sources. Six percent of people surveyed said they trust what they hear on social media, where 34% of people see more posts about the risks of vaccines than the benefits. </p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>",
