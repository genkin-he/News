The complainant alleged a Novartis employee based in the U.K. liked two LinkedIn posts about the approval of Cosentyx in hidradenitis suppurativa.

As Narasimhan shared during the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on Jan. 14, Kisqali reached 52% in new-to-brand market share in early breast cancer within three months of the launch.</p>\n<div class=\"t1-ad-slot\" data-ad-slot-id=\"38\"></div>\n<p>In early-stage breast cancer, Kisqali is going toe to toe with Eli Lilly’s rival CDK4/6 inhibitor Verzenio. While Verzenio’s adjuvant use is limited to node-positive tumors, Kisqali’s label also <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/novartis-heaps-pressure-lilly-broad-fda-approval-kisqali-early-breast-cancer\" target=\"_blank\">covers</a> those with node-negative (N0) disease.</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"11\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot2Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-2_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p>As the launch has progressed, the biggest points of discussion among market watchers have centered on how much market share Kisqali can steal from Verzenio and the willingness of doctors to more proactively treat node-negative patients. These patients are perceived to have a lower risk of progression compared with those with nodal involvement.</p>\n<p>“The biggest focus for us right now is maximizing the opportunity in the node-0 and node-1 patients without risk factors, where Kisqali is uniquely labeled and our competitors are not, and our ability to get those patients diagnosed and then ultimately on therapy,” Narasimhan said on a separate investor call Friday.</p>\n<p>In the early days of the launch, the majority of the new patient starts came from patients whom Verzenio can’t reach, Novartis’ U.S. president Victor Bulto said during an interview at the Fierce JPM Week on Jan. 14.</p>\n<p>While this is a positive indicator for the launch, the coin has two sides. The fast adoption in the non-overlapping population indicates Novartis is expanding the market, but it could also suggest that Kisqali is not doing so well at taking Verzenio’s share in the drugs’ shared patient population.</p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10\"></div>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"b47556a1-b184-4401-837a-6e5cdb74898d\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/pharma/standing-alone-novartis-bumps-its-growth-projection-through-end-decade\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">Novartis, after slimming down, boosts growth projection through the end of the decade</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>This situation, if confirmed, could draw a comparison to the PARP inhibitor market dynamics in first-line ovarian cancer. While GSK’s Zejula boasts a broad biomarker-agnostic label, it has mostly only been able to reach patients with certain non-mutated tumors. Although these patients account for half of the dru’s eligible patients, they’ve also been associated with low overall interest in using a PARP inhibitor. As a result, despite a narrower label, AstraZeneca and Merck’s Lynparza has remained king by hogging the more receptive BRCA-mutated subgroup.</p>\n<p>There are some differences between the PARP and CDK4/6 classes. In the PARP class, Lynparza was the first-to-market drug with several years to establish its presence. Conversely, CDK4/6 meds Kisqali and Verzenio arrived in the same year, even though Verzenio held the lone adjuvant indication for some time.</p>\n<p>Importantly, Kisqali boasts overall survival data seen across three phase 3 trials in the metastatic setting. Verzenio previously <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/handing-novartis-win-lilly-verzenio-barely-misses-overall-survival-goal-first-line-breast\">narrowly missed</a> an overall survival showing in first-line breast cancer.</p>\n<p>“I do believe that through the discussions we’ve had with most of the prescribers, they’ll go and have one CDK4/6 of choice across the spectrum,” Bulto said.</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"de956555-b1a1-4109-95a8-9162eb01af85\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/marketing/novartis-1st-super-bowl-ad-aims-create-movement-breast-cancer-awareness-blitz\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">Novartis' first Super Bowl ad aims to 'create a movement' with breast cancer awareness blitz</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>As Narasimhan and Bulto stressed, it's still too early in the launch to draw any long-term conclusions. One possible explanation for the initial adoption of Kisqali in the non-overlapping population might be found in the small number of doctors who have been waiting for a node-negative option.</p>\n<p>“I also want to caution [that] we’re learning […] who are the adopters, and we have to see whether these are first adopters in the academic centers, or this is diffusing more into the community,” Bulto said.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Novartis has maintained that Kisqali holds potential to reap $4 billion in peak sales in the adjuvant setting alone, or $8 billion altogether with its metastatic use. During Friday’s media call, Narasimhan said it’s still too early to break out the adjuvant projection by nodal stage.</p>\n<p>“We continue to believe this […] could be one of the largest medicines in Novartis history,” Narasimhan said. </p>\n</div>\n</div>",

The numbers were 30%, 22% and 20%, respectively, in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>Graham stressed that Vabysmo’s fourth-quarter share numbers were not directly comparable to previous quarters because a data aggregator recently issued a “restatement” of third-quarter share figures. If analyzed by prior metrics, Vabysmo expanded by roughly three percentage points across the three indications, she said.</p>\n<p>Lately, the competition between Vabysmo and a high-dose version of Regeneron’s Eylea has been the focus of industry watchers. In September, European regulators also approved a prefilled syringe of Eylea HD. Nevertheless, Roche is “really not seeing any impact in any part of the world” from the arrival of Eylea HD, Graham said.</p>\n<p>The Roche exec highlighted how the two products’ syringes are “materially different,” as the Vabysmo product offers one-hand administration, she said. </p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10\"></div>\n<p>“When you think about it, if you’re doing […] 100 shots a day, having that really ease of administration is super important,” she added. “I would say we definitely have device preference going on our side.”</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"04b47db6-3b20-45ea-8d38-2ad81b94e0a7\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/pharma/regeneron-ceo-says-its-needs-more-arrows-quiver-disappointing-eylea-hd\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">JPM25: Regeneron CEO says it needs more 'arrows in its quiver' as Eylea HD sales fall short</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>As for Tecentriq, sales of the PD-L1 inhibitor declined by 3.3%—or remained flat at constant exchange rates—last year.</p>\n<p>“We do believe, as we have mentioned previously, that Tecentriq is getting close to peak, and we expect sales growth to be in the zero to low-single-digit range going forward,” Graham said.</p>\n<p>In 2024, Roche welcomed antibody-drug conjugate Polivy to the blockbuster club. With full-year sales of 1.12 billion Swiss francs, the drug ranked 16th on the company’s list of top meds.</p>\n<p>Although Polivy’s fourth-quarter sales, at 304 million Swiss francs, were flat over the prior quarter and came in 6% below Wall Street’s estimates, the drug expanded its U.S. market share in the key first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma indication to 29%, according to Graham.</p>\n<p>Roche has increasingly been leaning on new drugs like Vabysmo for growth.

            "description": "<div class=\"row media-content-body article-body mb-lg-4\" id=\"article-body-row\">\n<div class=\"col content\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Want the eyeballs of people with obesity? Think TV. That is a takeaway from a CMI Media Group survey that <a href=\"https://cmimediagroup.com/resources/media-vitals-2024-2025/?utm_source=online&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=MV-Consumer-Scoop\">suggests</a> the fight for attention will be waged on traditional marketing battlegrounds, with TV emerging as the best way for pharmas to reach people with obesity and Facebook still reigning supreme in the social media space.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Marketers have more ways than ever to reach patients, but the survey of 579 people who self-identified as having obesity shows that the classics are still in style. TV topped the list of media channels, with 76% of respondents telling CMI they watch it at least once a week. Email and social media came in second and third, respectively, with 74% and 70% weekly users in the survey sample.</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[300,250]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"10\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot1Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-1_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How people watch TV has changed, though, with paid and free streaming the most common methods. Paid cable TV and free TV via antenna were a distant third and fourth, with less than half the number of users as paid streaming. CMI found comedy, drama and action/adventure are the most popular genres for the group.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :class=\"{ 'mobile-ad': false }\" :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"false\" :hide-on-mobile=\"false\" :randomize-element-id=\"true\" :sizes=\"[['fluid']]\" ad-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" class=\"inline-native-ad pos-14\" placeholder-id=\"nativeAdUnitPos14\" pos=\"14\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos3\"></div>\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<dynamic-ad-slot :hide-on-desktop=\"0\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :out-of-page=\"true\" :pos=\"8\" ad-id=\"contentEmbedOne\" placeholder-id=\"content-embed-one\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The survey data on what people with obesity watch—and how they access the video content—informed recommendations by Brittany Hernandez, associate director of video strategy and investment at CMI.</p>\n<div class=\"t1-ad-slot\" data-ad-slot-id=\"38\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“By leveraging targeted video campaigns on paid streaming services like Hulu or Peacock, pharma brands can maximize their ad dollars, investing where the highest number of obesity patients are tuning into,” Hernandez said in the report. “Pharma advertisers should also explore robust sponsorships surrounding comedic and dramatic genres, engaging and resonating with patients in the content they watch most.”</p>\n<p>\n<dynamic-ad-slot :container-size-map=\"[[1,1]]\" :hide-on-desktop=\"1\" :hide-on-mobile=\"0\" :pos=\"11\" :sizes=\"[[300, 250]]\" ad-id=\"adSlot2Mobile\" placeholder-id=\"ad-slot-2_mobile\"></dynamic-ad-slot>\n</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"690cfabb-e962-4b9a-9853-1306a9ea96cb\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/marketing/ozempics-biggest-night-glp-1s-back-hollywood-spotlight-lilly-backed-2025-golden-globes\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">‘Ozempic’s biggest night’: GLP-1s back in Hollywood spotlight at 2025 Golden Globes</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Social media is another widely used channel. And while upstarts such as TikTok dominate the news, the survey suggests Facebook is the first port of call for the vast majority of people with obesity. CMI found 83% of social media users look at Facebook at least once a week, putting it well ahead of YouTube (63%) and Instagram (43%) in the rankings.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The data collected from 107 caregivers are a little different, with email and search topping TV on the list of their most-used channels and with YouTube sneaking ahead of Facebook on the social media rankings. There is value in factoring caregivers into marketing campaigns, the survey suggested, because they are more likely than patients to ask doctors about the drug ads they see.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another section of the survey points to the types of messages that might resonate with patients. Obesity patients can have issues accessing care, the survey found, leading Toby Katcher, senior vice president of video strategy and investment at CMI, to advise pharma brands to “emphasize accessibility, recognizing that many patients have transportation and financial challenges.” </p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Though the full commercial is being kept under wraps until its prime-time debut, he told Fierce that it plays on the attention often given to women’s breasts in society, then “turns it on its head to basically raise attention on the need to do a much better job at diagnosis, at mammograms.”</p>\n<p>“You will see an ad that defies the current norms of pharma advertisement because, in fact, it is not a pharma advertisement,” he said, emphasizing the ad’s goals of raising awareness about the importance of breast health and, in doing so, increasing early detection of breast cancer.</p>\n<div class=\"olytics_injection\" id=\"omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10\"></div>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"2e983a46-af50-469a-8151-bdea87ec189e\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/marketing/super-bowl-nears-tv-data-show-glp-1-game-day-ads-enjoyed-big-year\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">As Super Bowl nears, TV data show GLP-1 game day ads enjoyed a big year</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>With the commercial at its center, the \"Your Attention, Please\" campaign will be a “surround-sound” effort, Bulto said, and includes a dedicated website filled with tools and information to help visitors learn about breast health, assess their cancer risk and plan their routine checkups.</p>\n<p>The campaign’s important message will be further bolstered by the star power of comedian-actress Wanda Sykes and actress-musician Hailee Steinfeld, both of whom appear in the Super Bowl ad.</p>\n<p>The selection of the two celebs—a 60-year-old breast cancer survivor and a 28-year-old mental and physical health advocate, respectively—was deliberate. As Bulto explained, while Sykes brings valuable firsthand experience with breast cancer and early detection, Steinfeld’s popularity among younger generations may inspire younger women to check their risk factors and begin recommended screenings as soon as possible, especially as breast cancer rates rise among the under-50 set.</p>\n<p>Plus, beyond its celebrity partners, and even going beyond the campaign, Novartis is also teaming up with organizations including Susan G. Komen, Living Beyond Breast Cancer, Breastcancer.org and TOUCH, The Black Breast Cancer Alliance to boost support for community-level breast cancer advocacy initiatives and for legislation to improve access to breast imaging services.</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-entity\" data-embed-button=\"node\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:node.related_content\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"f2bee4b9-a506-4ce4-954a-029753a849da\" data-langcode=\"en\"><div class=\"container-fluid p-0\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<h3 class=\"label\">Related</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col title font-weight-extra-bold\">\n<a href=\"/pharma/novartis-heaps-pressure-lilly-broad-fda-approval-kisqali-early-breast-cancer\" rel=\"bookmark\"><span class=\"field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden\">Novartis heaps pressure on Lilly with broad FDA approval for Kisqali in early breast cancer</span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>As for why, exactly, Novartis chose this year and this effort to make its first foray into the high-profile (and high-cost) realm of Super Bowl advertisements, Bulto said the reasons were twofold.</p>\n<p>For one, he noted, the company has “become leaders in the CDK4/6 space” thanks to Kisqali and its recently expanded label, “and we truly believe—I, personally, truly believe—that with the privilege of being a leader in a space comes also the responsibility to think, what else can we do?”</p>\n<p>“And the second trigger was really thinking about—the debate inside the team was, how do we create a movement?” he said.</p>\n<p>Simply putting out data and information is “not enough” to significantly improve early breast cancer diagnosis rates, according to the exec.</p>\n<p>“And that’s why we thought big,” he said. “We thought, well, if we really want to move the needle … there’s no better platform than a Super Bowl.”</p>\n<p>That belief was further strengthened by their realization that not only is the Super Bowl audience objectively enormous, but it’s also nearly 50% female—“so we got very excited about this opportunity, and we think this is the right cause to put this investment and these efforts around,” Bulto said.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
