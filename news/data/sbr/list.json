The reduction in DPU was due to higher finance costs, lower NPI, and an enlarged unit base.</p>\n</div>",

The market has yet to fully appreciate the potential for earnings growth from its record-high order backlog as well as potential yard expansion of 20% to 30%.</p><p>Yangzijiang has an orderbook worth $24b. CAGR of earnings is expected to reach 14% in the next two years, driven by both revenue growth and margin expansion, as 65% of its orderbook is made up of containership orders that command higher value and margins.</p><p><br/>A key risk for the company is that since its revenue is in US dollars, a weak USD could see earnings drop by about 1.5% for every 1% decline in USD.

With 34% of its loan book to be refinanced in FY2025, and a low fixed-hedge profile of 32%, DBS expects CDREIT to be the top beneficiary of lower interest rates once cuts materialise in 2025.</p><p>Meanwhile, an oversupply of hotel rooms in Singapore and reduced room inventory at W Hotel amidst its refurbishment is projecting flat RevPAR growth for CDREIT’s Singapore hotel properties. However, it is marginally offset by flat borrowing costs year-on-year and incremental contributions from UK assets (Benson Yard, The Casting, and Hotel Indigo Exeter).</p><p>Additionally, the pivot towards the built-to-rent (BTR) sector amongst other possible lodging asset classes, highlights management’s strategic intent to build resilience through diversity and earnings stability post-pandemic.</p><p>“With two announced acquisitions within the UK – Benson Yard (purpose-built student accommodation) and Indigo Hotel Exeter, CDLHT’s UK income exposure is expected to go north of 20%.
