            "description": "<div class=\"nf__description\">\n<p><strong>Singapore hotels are facing an oversupply of rooms.</strong></p><p>CDL Hospitality Trust can expect flat revenues amidst an oversupply of hotel rooms in Singapore, but its recent acquisitions would offset some of the negative impact, a DBS report said.</p><p>DBS said CDLHT continues to be one of the top choices within the S-REIT space with a 40bps q/q dip in borrowing costs, after peaking in Q3 2024. With 34% of its loan book to be refinanced in FY2025, and a low fixed-hedge profile of 32%, DBS expects CDREIT to be the top beneficiary of lower interest rates once cuts materialise in 2025.</p><p>Meanwhile, an oversupply of hotel rooms in Singapore and reduced room inventory at W Hotel amidst its refurbishment is projecting flat RevPAR growth for CDREIT’s Singapore hotel properties. However, it is marginally offset by flat borrowing costs year-on-year and incremental contributions from UK assets (Benson Yard, The Casting, and Hotel Indigo Exeter).</p><p>Additionally, the pivot towards the built-to-rent (BTR) sector amongst other possible lodging asset classes, highlights management’s strategic intent to build resilience through diversity and earnings stability post-pandemic.</p><p>“With two announced acquisitions within the UK – Benson Yard (purpose-built student accommodation) and Indigo Hotel Exeter, CDLHT’s UK income exposure is expected to go north of 20%. CDLHT managers remain opportunistic in pursuing accretive overseas acquisitions, with the UK remaining a favoured market,” DBS said.</p>\n</div>",
