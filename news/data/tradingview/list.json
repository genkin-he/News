I felt better,\" she said.</p><p class=\"\">In December, Novo said people who adhered to the CagriSema treatment plan achieved overall weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, with 40.4% losing 25% or more. </p><p class=\"\">That was lower than the 25% across-the-board weight loss it expected. The disappointment wiped as much as $125 billion off Novo's value on the day.</p><p class=\"\">Novo also said only 57.3% of patients reached the highest dose of the medicine, but didn't explain why. Was it because patients suffered side-effects or because they lost weight on lower doses? Both could explain why they didn't progress to the highest dose.</p><p class=\"\">Some investors and analysts were also surprised the trial used a \"flexible\" protocol, permitting patients to change their dose strength instead of adhering to a schedule. </p><p class=\"\">They said this could be a factor in the low take-up of the highest dose.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Bergen, Norway, 4 February 2025: Today, Lifecare ASA (LIFE), a clinical stage medical sensor company developing the next generation Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM), can announce that chemistry with improved sensitivity has been successfully tested in Lifecare’s CGM-sensor.</p><p class=\"\">Reference is made to Lifecare’s stock exchange announcement 14 January 2025, regarding up to fivefold improvement in sensor chemistry sensitivity, with a new generation of Lifecare’s proprietary chemistry.</p><p class=\"\">Lifecare’s laboratory in Mainz, Germany, has now completed the first tests of the improved chemistry in implants similar to those used in the company's long-term studies. These implants have been subjected to laboratory testing. Similar to the initial and very promising tests of the chemistry in macro-test cells, the first analyses show promising responses after testing the chemistry in miniaturized sensors. This contributes to our expectation that the chemistry can lead to significantly improved sensor sensitivity. The actual function of the implants in-vitro will be subject to ongoing testing, after which the implants with improved sensor chemistry later will be subjected to long-term studies in-vivo.</p><p class=\"\">The sensor sensitivity defines the potential to detect small changes of glucose levels and is an important performance parameter for CGM. The accuracy of CGM’s is commonly referred to based on Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD), where a MARD lower than 10% indicates clinically acceptable accuracy. In Q2 2023, data from Lifecare's Clinical Development Study LFC-SEN-001 confirmed that our CGM system had achieved a MARD of 9,7%. The improved chemistry sensitivity can impact the MARD, however this is subject to further testing.</p><p class=\"\">In a product perspective the most prominent benefit of enhanced sensor sensitivity is improvement of the sensor signal-to-noise ratio. This leads to improved data readings and enhanced sensor performance, as well as simplifying algorithms and data processing efficiency.</p><p class=\"\">- Any validation of the improved chemistry sensitivity represents a confirmatory advance for our sensor technology. However, it is particularly promising that the improved chemistry sensitivity now has been subject to initial validation in a near-real-world test scenario. Lifecare's team of researchers and developers continuously strives for improved precision and quality in glucose monitoring to ensure better outcomes for patients with diabetes, says Joacim Holter, Lifecare CEO.</p></span></div>",
