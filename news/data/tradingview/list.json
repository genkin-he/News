The guidance came as a surprise to analysts, who had expected moderate single-digit percentage growth due to uncertainties around key drugs losing exclusivity, or LOEs, including heart failure drug Entresto in mid-2025. </p><p class=\"\">\"Whilst we do take our numbers up today to land in the FY25 guidance ranges (this drives our PT to CHF 90 from CHF85, which is 11.5x our revised FY25 Core EPS forecast vs. prior 11.1x), we remain closer to the LSD% end of the topline guide vs. the high end. Given our preference this year for catalyst-driven stories, we remain UW,\" Barclays wrote. </p><p class=\"\">In response to the updated forecast, Barclays adjusted its model to align with Novartis' expectations.

The higher-than-expected net profit was mainly thanks to the Swiss group's investment bank, where revenue was well ahead of consensus expectations, RBC says. Costs came in higher than expected in some divisions, but this could be due to seasonal factors, the analysts say. UBS provided more detailed targets for the turnaround of its U.S. global-wealth-management unit, which is positive, RBC says. On the integration of Credit Suisse, it reiterated its end-2026 savings target but raised its expectations for expenses, RBC says. (adria.calatayud@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

While China just unveiled tariffs on select U.S. imports, the deadline for China's tariffs doesn't come until Feb. 10, the market analyst notes. This is keeping USD/CNH movements relatively contained, Scutt says. For now, USD/CNH's swing highs of 7.3680 in September 2023 and 7.3750 in September 2022 remain key levels for traders, he says. \"A sustained break above could open the door for an extended run higher, given the price signal it would send,\" Scutt adds. USD/CNH is 0.1% higher at 7.3181. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

The delay comes as Mexico and Canada agreed to take measures to tackle the trafficking of fentanyl across the U.S. border. Trump's roulette affirms the newfound risk-off/risk-on patterns, says Commerzbank Research's Christoph Rieger. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rises 2.5 basis points to 4.569%, while the 2-year Treasury yield is flat at 4.266%, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0714 GMT - China's first shots in the trade war look largely symbolic, Oxford Economics says. Beijing responded to Trump's 10% blanket tariffs on Chinese imports with a series of tariffs on U.S. products like coal. By OE's estimates, the move raises the weighted effective tariff rate on U.S. imports into China by close to +2ppt, \"thereby a more symbolic move for now.\" The blanket-style U.S. tariffs plus stronger retaliation language imply a very high chance of further action by the U.S., economist Louise Loo says. OE thinks China will continue with meticulously targeted tariff lists and lean on defensive measures like tax rebates and support for exporters. It may also deploy export controls and probes into U.S. companies. As markets price more uncertainty, the yuan is likely to come under continued pressure, OE says.

French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou pushed the 2025 budget bill without a vote by lawmakers, and faces a no-confidence vote. Using a constitutional tool to pass the bill \"was what led to fall of the previous French government,\" the fixed income research director says. \"Hence, there is still some considerable risks to being long France even at spread of some 75 basis points in the 10-year area to Germany,\" Sorensen says.

However, this is unlikely to impact central bank policy in the longer term, says the head of multi-asset solutions in a note. \"We would expect this to be a one-off impact of inflation, rather than a sustained increase,\" he says. In the short term, this could keep rates higher for longer, he adds. Federated Hermes, however, does not expect it to have long-term implications for central bank policy. U.S. President Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Canada reached a deal to put tariffs on hold for a month.

Beijing's measures only target some U.S. products, whereas the U.S. tariffs apply to all Chinese exports to the country, says Zhang. \"This is likely only the beginning of a long process for the two countries to negotiate,\" the economist says. The negotiations between the U.S. and its neighbors suggest that there is some hope of de-escalation at some point, though the road ahead is likely to be bumpy, Zhang says. Washington postponed tariffs on Canada and Mexico after reaching border-related deals.

U.S. President Trump moved to levy tariffs on Mexico and Canada, but the leaders of the three states reached an agreement to put tariffs on hold for a month. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0437 GMT - The real impact of U.S. tariffs is too early to determine, according to Stephen Dover, chief market strategist and head of the Franklin Templeton Institute, in a commentary. It is unclear whether these tariffs are a long-term policy or a negotiation tactic by President Trump to secure concessions, the strategist notes. At the margin, these tariffs should encourage more domestic production of goods in the United States. However, the uncertainty surrounding the permanence of these tariffs makes it challenging for companies to make informed capital investment decisions, Dover adds. Chinese policymakers and businesses are likely to implement measures to mitigate the impact should the situation escalate further, Dover notes. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0431 GMT - China could ramp up foreign direct investment in 2025 to ease the impact of higher U.S. tariffs on its exports and the broader economy, ANZ economists say in a research note. Chinese companies have invested heavily in third countries like Mexico since the initial U.S.-China trade dispute in 2018. According to China's commerce ministry, 326 Chinese enterprises registered to invest in Mexico in 2023, up from 133 in 2020. The economists think the trend is not only tariff driven, but also due to supply chain shifts. \"Low industrial profit under overcapacity concerns and relatively high production costs drives supply-chain shift overseas,\" they say. ANZ expects more overseas investment from Chinese companies to reduce reliance on traditional markets and diversify trade influence, they add. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0415 GMT - There are high hopes that China may strike a deal with President Trump to delay the additional 10% tariff, after Mexico and Canada managed to delay the U.S. tariffs, says IG. However, there is \"still room for surprises and Trump could still come down hard\", market strategist Yeap Jun Rong writes in a note. China is seen as a prominent threat to U.S. national security and economic competition, Yeap notes. The tech rivalry between the two countries has become even more pronounced recently with Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, he adds. \"But if China can pull it off, risk sentiments may find further recovery momentum, at least in the near term,\" Yeap says.(amanda.lee@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0410 GMT - Indonesia's economy is expected to have grown 4.89% in 4Q 2024, slightly easing from 3Q's 4.95%, according to the median estimate of six economists polled by The Wall Street Journal.

The 4Q outcome would peg 2024 growth at an average of 5%, maintaining a steady pace from 2023, they add. Indonesia's 2023 GDP growth was 5.05%. The data is due Wednesday.
