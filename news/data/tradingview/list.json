            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Deutsche Bank said it maintains an out-of-consensus expectation that Mexico's central bank (Banxico) will likely lower the policy rate by 25bps on Thursday, bringing it to 9.75%. </p><p class=\"\">The bank acknowledges that risks are heavily tilted toward the validation of the market's consensus and pricing of a 50bps cut given the current tight monetary stance, the progress attained by the disinflationary process, the continued softening of activity amid an uninspiring growth outlook, the dovish bias expressed by a majority in the Board, and the peso's retracement to similar levels observed prior to United States trade announcement of tariffs last week. </p><p class=\"\">Nevertheless, given the persistent external risks of substantial downside implications for the economy, Deutsche Bank \"firmly\" believes that a 25bps cut represents a more prudent choice in the current</p><p class=\"\">environment. </p><p class=\"\">Monday's pause in the imposition of U.S. tariffs against Mexican imports restored the bank's baseline scenario, which features latent risks of material disruptions to</p><p class=\"\">the trade relationship even if tariffs remain unexecuted. </p><p class=\"\">Deutsche Bank continues to see the outlook for monetary policy in Mexico as a tug-of-war between intentions and external conditions. Indeed, the U.S. tariff threat will remain outstanding for some time, in its view.</p></span></div>",

These assumptions left room for inflation to accelerate through mid-year without much trade policy uncertainty, providing a pathway for the Fed to cut its policy rate by 25bp in March and June. We still think these views are the right ones, but we are not as confident regarding slow implementation as we were before,\" said economists led by Michael Gapen.</p><p class=\"\">Trump did pause tariffs against Mexico and Canada but left the 10% incremental tariff on China intact.</p><p class=\"\">\"We see this episode of on-again-off-again tariffs as amplifying the views expressed by the Fed at its December meeting, when most FOMC members were concerned about greater uncertainty regarding [the personal consumption expenditure price index] and saw risks to PCE inflation as tilted to the upside.

One country that is having a good trade war is Great Britain. At least, so far, it is managing to duck the fight . French factory production unexpectedly dropped at the end of the year, contributing to a backsliding in the eurozone's second-largest economy, with few signs of a rapid rebound at the start of 2025. A private gauge of China's service activity expanded at a slower clip in January, pointing in the same direction as official data as both demand and supply cooled at the start of the year. China reported record-high tourism revenue and travel numbers during the Lunar New Year holiday, offering a glimmer of hope for policymakers as they continue their efforts to boost domestic demand. South Korea's headline inflation accelerated at a faster-than-expected pace in the first month of the year to stay above the central bank's 2% target. The consumer-price index rose 2.2% in January from a year earlier, following a 1.9% gain in December.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">When it comes to the artificial intelligence threat from China's DeepSeek, everyone in Silicon Valley seems to be singing from the same hymn sheet.</p><p class=\"\">Two more voices joined the choir on Tuesday. Alphabet, the parent company of search engine Google, only had good things to say about DeepSeek when it reported mixed results. \"Tremendous,\" and \"very good work\" is how CEO Sundar Pichai described the upstart, which claims to have developed an AI model that rivals those made by U.S. tech companies at a fraction of the cost. Pichai added that Google's models are still some of the best.</p><p class=\"\">Lisa Su, CEO of chip maker AMD, said DeepSeek shows how quickly the technology is innovating, which is good for business. Earlier this week, Palantir's Alex Karp said cheap AI was a plus for his company because it lowered input costs. And Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella last week referred to the obscure economic concept of Jevons Paradox â developed to show why 19th century coal use skyrocketed even as industry grew more energy efficient â to explain how DeepSeek would help bolster demand for AI services. Nvidia described it as an \"excellent AI advancement.\"</p><p class=\"\">Investors may be forgiven for feeling a little suspicious of all the positive spin. There are at least two aspects to the DeepSeek threat. One is the AI arms race between China and the U. S. â something from which Palantir, with extensive defense contracts, might be best placed to benefit. This is the side of DeepSeek that prompted comparisons with Sputnik, the 1950s Soviet Union satellite that spurred the investment that led to the U.S. landing on the moon first a decade later.</p><p class=\"\">The other side is whether Big Tech's huge spending on AI investment is worth it, purely from a perspective of returns on capital employed. Executives still think it will be â none offered hints that their plans had changed since DeepSeek jolted the market. They might be right. But with the impact yet to show up in earnings, investors have every reason to remain skeptical about the game plan.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Brian Swint</li></ul><p class=\"\">***</p><p class=\"\">Alphabet's Revenue Misses Expectations. AI Spending Accelerates.</p><p class=\"\">Alphabet was under pressure after revenue growth, while positive, slowed in the December quarter, and revenue in the closely watched cloud computing business fell short of expectations. CEO Sundar Pichai said it is accelerating spending on data centers for artificial intelligence, with $75 billion in capital expenditures this year.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">That amount of capital spending compares with just over $52 billion for   2024. Capital spending in the December quarter ran above expectations.   CFO Anat Ashkenazi said most of these investments were in technical   infrastructure, the largest component being investments in servers and   data centers.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">The Google parent reported fourth-quarter earnings of $2.15 a share and   revenue of $96.47 billion, up 12% from a year earlier but the lowest   growth rate since 2023. The per-share number beat expectations but   revenue fell short. Cloud revenue rose 30% to $12 billion but missed   estimates.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Its video platform YouTube offered a bright spot for Alphabet, with   advertising revenue of $10.47 billion that beat expectations. Alphabet's   total advertising revenue was $72.5 billion, up 10.6% from a year earlier   and ahead of forecasts.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Google has remained top of the heap in search for years, but generative   AI-powered chatbots have put its market share in that business at risk.   Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta Platforms' AI offering, along   with the new China-based DeepSeek's chat model compete with Google's   Gemini. </li></ul><p class=\"\">What's Next: Investors are awaiting updates on the Justice Department's antitrust case involving Google. A judge ruled in August that Google maintained a monopoly in general search services and general text advertising. The Justice Department has suggested a breakup of the company as a potential remedy.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Angela Palumbo and Liz Moyer</li></ul><p class=\"\">***</p><p class=\"\">AMD Disappoints on Data Center Revenue Despite Earnings Beat</p><p class=\"\">Advanced Micro Devices beat expectations for earnings but soft data center revenue failed to impress Wall Street analysts.

AMD forecast sales in the current quarter to a   range with $7.1 billion at the midpoint versus the $7 billion analysts'   estimate.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Personal-computing revenue rose 58%, to $2.3 billion, driven by solid   demand for its Ryzen processor chips. But its gaming unit sales dropped   59%, to $563 million, and its embedded segment fell 13%, to $923 million.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">AMD has gotten a boost from the surge in AI demand that has lifted the   chip sector. It makes chips that help create and use tools that produce   humanlike text, images, and video. As it moves toward more AI activities,   it has cut its global workforce by more than 1,000 jobs. </li></ul><p class=\"\">What's Next: Su said artificial intelligence models such as DeepSeek and AI infrastructure buildout announcements like Stargate are highlights showing the rapid pace of AI innovation that will drive more AI compute demand and give AMD growth opportunities.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Tae Kim</li></ul><p class=\"\">***</p><p class=\"\">RFK Jr.'s Nomination Advances as Big Pharma Reports Earnings</p><p class=\"\">Robert F.

Cassidy's decision significantly narrows the   odds that those opposed to his nomination will muster enough Republican   votes to block him, making his eventual confirmation highly likely.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Vaccine maker Pfizer's stock fell 2.2% after the vote despite reporting   earnings that beat expectations. CEO Albert Bourla told Barron's he has   met with Kennedy and remains optimistic about the Trump administration   and Pfizer's focus on cancer treatments. Fellow vaccine maker Moderna's   stock closed down 6.5%.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Pfizer maintained the 2025 guidance laid out in December. Its   fourth-quarter earnings were 63 cents a share and revenue was $17.8   billion, up 21% from a year ago. It didn't update on its closely watched   obesity pill danuglipron, but promised data by the end of the first   quarter.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Merck's human papillomavirus vaccine Gardasil's fourth-quarter sales fell   17%, and it paused shipments to China. Full-year guidance was below   expectations, but CEO Rob Davis said confidence about successfully   navigating the 2028 expiration of patents for its cancer drug Keytruda   remains \"unchanged.\" </li></ul><p class=\"\">What's Next: Merck expects sales of $64.1 billion to $65.5 billion in 2025.

Robinhood general counsel Lucas Moskowitz said they believed they were in   full compliance with regulations.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Robinhood started event contracts during the U.S. presidential election.

Yet, it wasn't all good news for the Danish drugmaker.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Novo Nordisk reported earnings of 6.34 Danish kroner ($0.88) a share on   sales of 85.7 billion DKK ($11.9 billion) for the quarter, beating   expectations for earnings of 5.98 DKK a share on sales of 80.1 billion   DKK, according to FactSet.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">However, it also said it sees 2025 sales growth between 16% and 24% in   2025, less than the 26% growth observed in 2024.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Sales of Wegovy more than doubled from the same period last year, and   came largely in line with analysts' expectations at 19.9 billion DKK.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Shares have taken a beating in recent months, punished by growing worries   that sales of its blood sugar and appetite controlling GLP-1 drugs   wouldn't live up to the hype. </li></ul><p class=\"\">What's Next: The coming quarters will be crucial for Novo Nordisk as the narrative around the company has recently begun to shift for the worse.

He has been given a diagnosis of stage four cancer. Because he has had organ transplants, chemotherapy isn't an option. If he gets stronger and can do radiation, they may be able to extend his life from a week or two to six months, maybe longer.</p><p class=\"\">Most of our visit was spent talking about memories we had and about his end-of-life wishes. He has a 30-year-old son and two grandchildren, and his wife is stepmother to his son. He received a $250,000 inheritance last year and would like to take that money and pay off his $150,000 mortgage so that his wife will have the house paid off. I don't know the interest rate. His big wish is for his son to get the house after his wife dies. At this point, what can be done? He was weak, and it was hard to determine what his will says.</p><p class=\"\">Assuming he gets stronger and doesn't die soon, what is the best course of action? Obviously, see a lawyer. I have seen letters where one spouse dies and the children don't get what the will specifies. Is some kind of trust better? I have no reason to distrust his wife, but I don't know her very well. At this point, does he just hope everything works out OK? From what I know, I don't think his wife can afford the house on her income alone. She has worked as a waitress in a local restaurant for over 20 years.</p><p class=\"\">Without his disability checks, his wife might end up having to sell the house. She would like to retire, but I don't know how much Social Security she would get on her own or using his earnings history. They have no savings other than the $250,000 from the inheritance. I wish I had known about this months and years ago so I could have helped, but I never felt it was my place to ask. It all feels so pointless and discouraging. I feel the big lesson here isn't to put off estate planning and to ensure your wishes are followed â especially if a stepparent is involved.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">A Friend</li></ul><p class=\"\">Read the Moneyist's response here.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Quentin Fottrell</li></ul><p class=\"\">***</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Newsletter edited by Liz Moyer, Patrick O'Donnell, Callum Keown</li></ul><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
