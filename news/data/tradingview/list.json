            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Josh Nathan-Kazis</p><p class=\"\">The Senate's finance committee has cleared the way for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s health secretary nomination to head to a full Senate vote, pushing him a major step closer to confirmation.</p><p class=\"\">The committee voted Tuesday to favorably refer Trump's Health and Human Services secretary nominee ‚Äî a strident critic of vaccines and a skeptic of their vaccine ‚Äî to the Senate. Drug and food stocks stumbled after the panel's vote, as the once unthinkable notion of Kennedy leading the federal government's public health bureaucracy moved closer to reality.</p><p class=\"\">Shares of Pfizer, a major vaccine maker, fell from $26.25 ahead of the vote to $25.66 immediately after, a 2.2% drop. The stock is now down on the day, though releasing earnings results Tuesday morning that beat expectations.</p><p class=\"\">Shares of the vaccine maker Moderna tumbled 9% following the vote before recovering, and are are now down 3.9% on the day.</p><p class=\"\">The S&amp;P 500 Pharmaceuticals Industry index, which tracks drug stocks in the S&amp;P 500, fell roughly 1% following the vote, and the SPDR S&amp;P Biotech ETF, which tracks biotech stocks, fell 1.5%.</p><p class=\"\">Food stocks also dropped, and the S&amp;P Food and Beverage Select Industry index was down roughly 0.6% following the vote.</p><p class=\"\">A powerful Republican, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R., La.), had directed challenging lines of questioning at Kennedy in hearings last week, leading to widespread speculation that he might eventually oppose the nominee's approval.</p><p class=\"\">On Tuesday, however, Cassidy voted to favorably approve Kennedy's nomination out of committee. The vote was split along party lines, with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent, voting with the Democrats.</p><p class=\"\">Cassidy could still vote against Kennedy when the full Senate votes. He arrived late to Tuesday's committee meeting, and left without making any comments on his vote. If four Republicans vote against Kennedy on the Senate floor, his nomination would fail.</p><p class=\"\">The vote of the full Senate on the nomination has not yet been scheduled.</p><p class=\"\">Kennedy's bid to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ‚Äî which has the largest budget of any federal agency ‚Äî has roiled Washington more than virtually any of President Donald Trump's top nominees thus far.</p><p class=\"\">Kennedy's stance toward vaccines has been a key focus for lawmakers. In a hearing last week, under questioning by Cassidy, Kennedy declined to assert that measles and hepatitis b vaccines don't cause autism.</p><p class=\"\">\"That's kind of a yes or no question,\" Cassidy said.</p><p class=\"\">\"If the data is there, I will absolutely do that,\" Kennedy said.</p><p class=\"\">\"The data has been there for a long time,\" Cassidy said.</p><p class=\"\">Scientific consensus currently holds that vaccines  do not cause autism.</p><p class=\"\">Democrats railed against Kennedy in opening statements delivered ahead of the committee vote Tuesday morning.</p><p class=\"\">\"The question in front of us this morning is pretty simple: Do Senators want their legacy to include disregarding basic health science and instead of elevating conspiracy theorists?,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who is the ranking member on the finance committee.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Josh Nathan-Kazis at josh.nathan-kazis@barrons.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Originally published in FedEx's 2024 Global Economic Impact Report</p><p class=\"\">NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESS Newswire / February 4,¬†2025 / The U.S. economy faced macroeconomic headwinds in FY 2024, with moderating inflation, continued job growth, and low unemployment helping boost overall U.S. GDP.</p><p class=\"\">Trade between the U.S. and other countries also showed signs of recovery in the second half of FY 2024,13 as U.S. businesses continued looking to new markets for both supply chain partners and end customers. For example, U.S. imports from Mexico increased nearly 5% in CY 2023, reaching a total of $475.6 billion.14</p><p class=\"\">FedEx operations in the U.S. are uniquely positioned to help customers adapt to changing economic conditions and shifting trade patterns. The company operates two major air hubs in Memphis and Indianapolis that provide capacity for domestic and international air shipments, as well as dedicated international air gateways in Alaska and Miami to facilitate trade between the U.S. and APAC and LAC regions, respectively. FedEx Freight is a leading provider of less-than-truckload (LTL) services - an economical option for U.S. businesses needing to ship cargo that won't fill an entire trailer - while the extensive FedEx road network connects thousands of facilities to enable deliveries to 100% of U.S. residences and businesses.</p><p class=\"\">Across this network, FedEx helps ensure that the company's services and its economic impact extend to communities across the nation. FedEx employed approximately 370,000 people15 in the U.S. in FY 2024 and contracted with nearly 6,000 independent service provider businesses to provide pickup and delivery services on behalf of FedEx. Independent service provider companies employ their own drivers and support staff, and utilize their own equipment for transporting packages. More than half of these businesses have provided service to FedEx for more than f ive years, and 38% are minority, veteran, or women-owned. Since 2018, the average annual revenue for service providers has more than doubled to $2.1 million, and the annual revenue generated totals $12.3 billion.</p><p class=\"\">The scale of these operations and the range of the company's services make FedEx a significant presence in the U.S. Transportation and Warehousing sector,16 which grew substantially in FY 2024.</p><p class=\"\">The sector's total net economic output reached an estimated $981 billion in FY 2024, an 18% increase over total net economic output in FY 2023. FedEx directly contributed an estimated 6.7% of that net economic output in FY 2024.</p><p class=\"\">Across the entire U.S. economy, FedEx directly contributed an estimated 0.2% of net economic output in FY 2024, a considerable impact for a single company.</p><p class=\"\">In addition to this direct impact, FedEx indirectly contributed an estimated $8.1 billion to net economic output across the entire U.S. economy in FY 2024.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Measuring market-level impact</strong></p><p class=\"\">The contributions that FedEx makes to the U.S. economy are often most noticeable in locations where the company has a large presence. Cities, counties, and states that house significant FedEx facilities experience the direct impact of its capital expenditures, high levels of company employment, and purchases with local suppliers, along with the economic activity indirectly generated by the company's extensive shipping, logistics, and business services.</p><p class=\"\">To illustrate this localized impact, Dun &amp; Bradstreet analyzed FedEx economic contributions to 13 U.S. markets, including seven states - Alaska, California, Florida, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee - and six major metropolitan areas, including Dallas-Fort Worth-Plano, Indianapolis (Marion County), Memphis (Shelby County), Miami (Miami-Dade County), Pittsburgh (Allegheny County), and Los Angeles (Los Angeles County). The analysis focused on the company's impact on the Transportation and Warehousing sector, where FedEx makes substantial contributions due to the size of its network and the nature of its core services. As in the overall U.S. economy, FedEx contributed to strong economic growth at the market level. All 13 markets analyzed recorded increases in GDP for the Transportation and Warehousing sector in FY 2024. Transportation and Warehousing growth also outpaced overall GDP growth in seven of the markets analyzed, including Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indianapolis, Miami, and Pittsburgh.</p><p class=\"\">FedEx also remains a major employer in these markets, paying wages that further stimulate economic activity across municipalities, counties, and entire states. For example, FedEx employs nearly 40,000 people in both California and Tennessee, approximately 18,000 people in Florida, nearly 15,000 in Pennsylvania, more than 12,000 in Ohio, and approximately 14,000 in New York. Those jobs are often concentrated in major metropolitan areas, such as Shelby County, Tennessee, where FedEx employs approximately 32,000 people; and Dallas-Fort Worth-Plano, Texas, where FedEx employs approximately 15,000 people.</p><p class=\"\">FedEx spending with local suppliers also makes important contributions to the economies of these markets. For example, FedEx spent $1.3 billion with suppliers in Marion County, Indiana, and $1.1 billion with suppliers in California in CY 2023. FedEx spending with local suppliers surpassed a half-billion dollars in several other markets in CY 2023, including Tennessee ($637 million), Pennsylvania ($612 million) Florida ($598 million), New York ($580 million).</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Employment</strong></p><p class=\"\">With operations and employees in every state, FedEx is one of the largest employers in the country. The company is committed to supporting all employees with a safe, inclusive, and growth-focused workplace. Since the company's inception, opportunity has been at the forefront of its commitment to excellence. Providing opportunities to everyone ensures that FedEx team members - and their diverse perspectives, backgrounds, identities, talents, and skills - all come together to make the company successful in an ever-changing global marketplace. To illustrate this commitment, in FY 2023,¬†57% of FedEx employees in the U.S. identified as minorities. Within U.S. management, employees that identified as minorities made up 37% of positions.</p><p class=\"\">As team members look to grow in their careers, FedEx offers tuition assistance and the Learning inspired by FedEx (LiFE) program - a partnership between FedEx and the University of Memphis. The LiFE program offers tuition-free, online degree options for more than 30 associate's and bachelor's programs of study. In FY 2024, approximately 4,500 employees were enrolled. FedEx is also dedicated to helping all team members develop their careers through learning and development opportunities, including the FedEx Learning Center that provides more than 25,000 online courses to employees after orientation.</p><p class=\"\">As part of the company's total rewards package, FedEx also provides competitive benefits to support the health and quality of life of employees and their eligible family members, including healthcare, wellness, paid sick leave, flexible paid time off, short- and long-term disability, and other benefits. Eligible full- and part-time employees may elect these competitive health benefits offered by FedEx for themselves and their eligible dependents. In 2023, FedEx covered more than 70% of total eligible health care costs on average for more than 360,000 participating employees and their dependents in the U.S.</p><p class=\"\">This commitment to providing high-quality jobs, career growth opportunities, and support for employees' health and wellbeing has repeatedly earned FedEx honors as one of the best places to work in the United States. For example, in 2023 FedEx was named by LinkedIn as one of the Top Companies to Grow your Career and recognized as a Blue Ribbon Company by Fortune. In 2024, FedEx was named one of the Best Companies to Work for by the Women's Choice Awards.</p><p class=\"\">13 https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/ditcinf2024d2.pdf</p><p class=\"\">14 https://www.bea.gov/news/2024/us-international-trade-goods-and-services-december-and-annual-2023</p><p class=\"\">15 This number includes active full-time and part-time FedEx employees.</p><p class=\"\">16 As defined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p><p class=\"\">For a closer look at select markets, read the full report here.</p><p class=\"\">Click here to learn about FedEx Cares, our global community engagement program.</p><p class=\"\">View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from FedEx Services on 3blmedia.com.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Contact Info:</strong></p><p class=\"\">Spokesperson: FedEx Services</p><p class=\"\">Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/fedex-services</p><p class=\"\">Email: info@3blmedia.com</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">SOURCE:</strong> FedEx Services</p><p class=\"\">View the original press release on ACCESS Newswire</p></span></div>",
