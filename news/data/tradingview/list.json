            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Josh Nathan-Kazis and Elsa Ohlen</p><p class=\"\">Novo Nordisk fourth-quarter results comfortably beat expectations, easing some of investors' recent concern about the stock, including fierce competition from Eli Lilly.</p><p class=\"\">Yet, it wasn't all good news for the Danish pharma giant and maker of blockbuster weight-loss and diabetes drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. It also forecast slower sales growth ahead.</p><p class=\"\">Novo posted fourth-quarter earnings of 6.34 ($0.88) Danish kroner a share on sales of 85.7 billion DKK, beating expectations for earnings of 5.98 DKK a share on sales of 80.1 billion DKK, according to FactSet.</p><p class=\"\">Novo's American depositary receipts, or ADRs, were up 3.9% to $85.80 in premarket trading Wednesday. Novo's Danish listed shares rose 3.6%.</p><p class=\"\">Soaring sales of Ozempic and Wegovy has helped the Danish company to overtake luxury conglomerate LVMH as Europe's most valuable company.</p><p class=\"\">But Novo shares have taken a beating in recent months, with the stock's ADRs falling nearly 40% in the last six months of 2024. Shares first slid on growing worries that sales Wegovy and Ozempic wouldn't live up to the hype, and then on disappointing trial data for its next-generation weight-loss drug CagriSema.</p><p class=\"\">A positive pipeline update in January wasn't enough to reverse the momentum, and ADRs were down roughly 30% over the past 12 months as of Tuesday.</p><p class=\"\">Novo's Wegovy and Ozempic are among the most consequential, closely watched new medications in recent history, but they face serious competition both from Lilly's rival drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound and from legal copycats manufactured by compounding pharmacies and sold by telehealth firms. While compounders will soon be barred from selling knockoffs of the Lilly drugs, Novo's drugs remain in shortage, and can legally be copied.</p><p class=\"\">Ozempic sales for the quarter came in at 33.9 billion DKK, slightly above expectations of 33 billion DKK, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. Wegovy sales more than doubled from the same period last year, and were largely in line with expectation at 19.9 billion DKK.</p><p class=\"\">Novo now forecast sales growth of between 16% and 24% in 2025, less than the 26% growth observed in 2024. Operating profit growth is expected to be between 19% and 27%, compared with a 26% growth in 2024.</p><p class=\"\">The guide range was broader than expected but better than feared and in line with the mid-point consensus call of 20%, according to BofA analyst Sachin Jain.</p><p class=\"\">\"We see an intact, strong demand for obesity treatments in the U.S. and elsewhere,\" CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen said in a call with journalists early Wednesday. He highlighted that the 2025 guidance assumes a \"quite significant\" ramp in volumes in the U.S.</p><p class=\"\">The new outlook reflects expected continued periodic supply constraints and related drug shortages.</p><p class=\"\">Lingering supply constrains have been a worry for investors as Novo's inability to meet the huge demand for its products has hampered sales.</p><p class=\"\">In December, Novo closed an $11 billion deal to ramp up its supply of GLP-1 medicines, though it could take time for the results of that deal to be felt in the market.</p><p class=\"\">\"If we redirect everything that we have of GLP-1 to the U.S. we will be immediately out of the drug shortage situation,\" Henrik Wulff, executive vice president for product supply, quality, and information technology at Novo, told Barron's in December. But Novo serves markets worldwide.</p><p class=\"\">\"We try to balance these launches up against the in-market demands, and try to guesstimate how we can get out of the drug shortages,\" he said.</p><p class=\"\">Shares of Novo have yet to recover from a startling update in late December on CagriSema, a drug that combines the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wwgovy, Semaglutide, with Novo had said it expected patients to lose at least 25% of their body weight on CagriSema, but in a Phase 3 trial patients only lost 22.7%.</p><p class=\"\">In January, Novo unveiled early results on another weight loss drug, amycretin, which appeared very promising, though the drug has years of studies ahead of it before it can make it to market.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Josh Nathan-Kazis at josh.nathan-kazis@barrons.com and Elsa Ohlen at elsa.ohlen@barrons.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
