In 2023, Romania introduced a solidarity contribution on the profits of oil and natural gas producers and oil refining companies amounting to 60% of taxable profits that exceed by more than 20% the average profits recorded in the 2018-2021 period.</p><p class=\"\">Sales revenue fell by 8% to 35.765 billion lei last year, OMV Petrom said in an unaudited financial report filed with the Bucharest Stock Exchange.</p><p class=\"\">\"Our operational performance was strong in 2024: hydrocarbon production was better than planned, with the smallest decline in the last seven years, and the refinery and power plant operated at high capacity.

This downtick reflected lower refining margins largely offset by sales channels performance.</p><p class=\"\">The gas and power division had an adjusted operating result of 352 million lei, down 84% from 2023. Despite good operational performance, the result was affected by changes in legislation and market dynamics. Gas sales volumes dropped 7% to 43.29 TWh, while net electricity output increased by 18% to 4.92 TWh.</p><p class=\"\">\"In 2024 only, we invested 7.2 billion lei to support Neptun Deep development, renewable energy projects and electro-mobility network expansion,\" Verchere said.</p><p class=\"\">\"We expect 2025 to be a difficult and volatile year, with fiscal and regulatory challenges. Assuming a predictable and competitive fiscal and regulatory environment, we expect to reach a record high level of investments of around 8 billion euro, which would contribute to Romania’s energy security and to the country’s economy,\" she added.</p><p class=\"\">Shares of blue-chip OMV Petrom traded 0.41% lower at 0.725 lei as at 1012 CET on Tuesday on the Bucharest bourse.</p><p class=\"\">(1 euro = 4.9766 lei)</p> </span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">TOKYO, Feb 4, 2025 - (JCN Newswire) - Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (MHI, TSE Code: 7011) announced that order intake increased 10.5% year-on-year to JPY4,968.9 billion in the three quarters ended December 31, 2024. Revenue rose 8.8% to JPY3,547.7 billion year-on-year, resulting in profit from business activities (business profit) of JPY264.7 billion, a 38.2% increase over the previous fiscal year, which represents a profit margin of 7.5%. Profit attributable to owners of parent (net income) was JPY172.1 billion, an increase of 24.7% year-on-year, with a profit margin of 4.9%. EBITDA was JPY382.0 billion, a 28.9% increase over Q1-3 FY2023, with an EBITDA margin of 10.8%, up 1.7 percentage points year-on-year.In Energy, order intake increased by JPY228.7 billion YoY, which reflected continued strong demand in Gas Turbine Combined Cycle (GTCC) and Aero Engines. Contracts for 16 large frame gas turbine units were concluded during Q1-3, the majority of which were from customers in the Americas. Revenue increased by JPY81.4 billion YoY; the largest gains were seen in GTCC, which worked to execute its sizeable backlog, and Aero Engines. Segment business profit increased by JPY67.9 billion YoY due to higher margins in GTCC, increased revenue and the rebound from one-time expenses in Aero Engines incurred in Q1-3 FY2023, together with stable performance in Nuclear Power.</p><p class=\"\">In P&amp;I, order intake increased by JPY219.8 billion YoY due to favorable performance in Engineering, Metals Machinery, Machinery Systems, and Waste-to-Energy Systems. Revenue was mostly in line with Q1-3 FY2023 levels. Improved margins in Engineering and Metals Machinery, combined with increased revenue in Engineering and Machinery Systems helped to raise segment business profit by JPY12.6 billion YoY.</p><p class=\"\">In LT&amp;D, revenue increased by JPY9.2 billion YoY as increased sales in Engines and Heating, Ventilation &amp; Air Conditioning (HVAC) offset a decline in units sold in Logistics Systems. The decrease in units sold in Logistics System and additional costs from a supply chain disruption in Turbochargers resulted in a JPY16.5 billion YoY decrease in segment business profit.</p><p class=\"\">In ADS, order intake decreased by JPY22.0 billion YoY due to large order volume booked in Q1-3 FY2023 in Defense &amp; Space. Revenue increased by JPY162.7 billion YoY, mainly in Defense &amp; Space. Increased revenue and higher margins in Defense &amp; Space outpaced the negative impact from a drop in 777 unit deliveries in Commercial Aviation, and segment business profit increased by JPY16.1 billion YoY.</p><p class=\"\">FY2024 Earnings Forecast</p><p class=\"\">MHI revised its guidance for the period ending March 31, 2025, increasing the forecasts for order intake, revenue, business profit, net income, EBITDA, and free cash flow over the previous announcement made November 5, 2024, to reflect stronger-than-anticipated performance during Q1-3. The full-year dividend target remains unchanged.CFO Message</p><p class=\"\">\"In the first three quarters of this fiscal year, many of our businesses continued the strong performance I shared with you during our last release, with all major financial indicators up year-on-year, especially business profit and net income,\" said Hisato Kozawa, MHI's Chief Financial Officer. He continued: \"Regarding order intake, GTCC and Aero Engines in Energy, and Metals Machinery in P&amp;I were star performers, with total orders exceeding the high bar set during the same period in FY2023. Revenue increased in Energy and ADS, which were executing on substantial order backlogs. Increased revenue, improved margins, the positive impact from yen depreciation, as well as a rebound from one-time charges incurred in the previous year drove the large profit growth seen during this period.</p><p class=\"\">\"We have increased our full-year guidance for most major indicators based on our strong performance during the first three quarters. Notably, we have updated our order intake target from JPY6 trillion to JPY6.4 trillion and business profit from JPY350 billion to JPY380 billion,\" Kozawa went on. \"In the fourth quarter, we aim to outperform this updated guidance by actively mitigating risks while building on the successes of the first three quarters.\"Note regarding forward looking statements:</p><p class=\"\">Forecasts regarding future performance outlined in these materials are based on judgments made in accordance with information available at the time they were prepared.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Donald Trump's trade policy announcements over the weekend raise the question of whether there is a bigger risk from tariffs to the eurozone than previously thought, according to Capital Economics' Andrew Kenningham. A 10% universal tariff imposed by the U.S. might shave 0.1% to 0.2% off eurozone GDP, he says in a note. But a 25% tariff, as imposed but suspended on Canada and Mexico, would have a more-than-proportionately larger effect because it would be harder for companies and exchange-rate moves to cushion the blow, Kenningham warns. A ball-park estimate is that would cut eurozone GDP by around 0.5%, leaving growth close to zero this year. Additionally, a prohibitive tariff of, say, 100% on European vehicles could on its own push Germany into recession. (edward.frankl@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Palm oil ended lower after President Trump paused the proposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada. Palm oil prices have risen in recent sessions amid concerns over tariffs on Canadian canola oil as well as an urgent need for alternative vegetable oils, Kenanga Futures says in a research note. Trump's delay of tariff implementations likely triggered profit-taking activities following recent rallies, they say. Meanwhile, ongoing worries about India's declining demand, which is at an 11-year low, could further dampen market sentiment. The Bursa Malaysia Derivatives contract for April delivery ended 63 ringgit lower at 4,304 ringgit a ton. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
