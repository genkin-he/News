Openings dropped to 7.6 million from 8.2 million in November. The data hints at less pressure on wage growth and potentially more supportive Federal Reserve policy, Swissquote Bank analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya says in a note. Traders will now turn their focus to U.S. ADP private payrolls data at 1315 GMT and the U.S. ISM services report at 1500 GMT.

Preliminary data show the country's box office sales exceeded 9 billion yuan during the Lunar New Year holiday, while domestic travel reached a new record of over 2.33 billion cross-regional trips within China, they say. These are positive signs for consumer sentiment, but HSBC remains cautious over whether the holiday spirit can translate into more sustainable momentum without further stimulus. Another fiscal policy push is still needed to drive a sustained increase in activities in the coming months, especially given geopolitical uncertainty, HSBC adds. (jiahui.huang@wsj.com; @ivy_jiahuihuang)</p><p class=\"\">0754 GMT - Citi expects Malaysia's minimum wage hike to boost consumer spending, with median wages projected to grow by a high single digit in 2025, analyst Huan Wen Gan writes in a note. The minimum wage was raised to MYR1,700/month from MYR1,500/month on Feb. 1. Retail trade, particularly at convenience stores and mini-markets, is likely see further support, he adds. The agriculture sector has lower median wages, but oil palm harvesters already earn above the new threshold, minimizing the impact on palm oil players, he reckons. Mr. D.I.Y. Group (M) may face higher labor costs, with an 8% wage hike factored into 2025 earnings estimates, he says. For every 1% increase in wages could result in a 0.8% cut in its 2025 net profit forecast, he adds. Given stronger consumption trends and stable earnings potential, Citi remains positive on Malaysia's consumer sector. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0732 GMT - German Bunds are running into resistance ahead of the yield lows of the year, but shaky risk sentiment and a sanguine European Central Bank wage tracker should keep the momentum going, says Commerzbank Research's Michael Leister. \"With the ongoing focus on trade wars and fragile risk sentiment we expect Bunds to stay bid,\" the head of interest rates strategy says in a note. That said, the air is getting thinner for Bunds as yields are approaching the lows recorded in the initial sessions of the year, Leister says. In addition, risk-off once again turns out to not be self-reinforcing, with equities stuck at the highs, he says. The 10-year German Bund yield falls 2.5 basis points to 2.374%, tracking U.S. Treasury yields lower, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0730 GMT - Limiting the downside risks for Chinese markets and the yuan depend on the potential of fresh talks between the U.S. and China, writes Mansoor Mohi-uddin, chief economist at Bank of Singapore. Financial markets on Tuesday had a muted reaction to China's retaliatory tariffs of 10%-15% on select U.S. goods, but there's a chance of a stronger reaction down the line if negotiations don't see results, Mohi-uddin says. Should U.S. tariffs on China remain at 10% this year, the impact should be manageable, he notes, adding that the measures will trim about 0.5% from China's GDP growth this year from its 5.0% rate in 2024. However, should the tariffs be raised to 20%-30%, growth may fall closer to 4.0%, Mohi-uddin estimates. (kimberley.kao@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0725 GMT - Japanese stocks ended higher, led by auto stocks, as fears about U.S. tariffs subside. Toyota Motor gained 3.1% after it raised earnings projections and reported third-quarter results. Meanwhile, Honda Motor climbed 8.2% following news that Nissan's board is planning to reject Honda's terms for a combination of the two automakers. Nissan Motor fell 4.9%. The Nikkei Stock Average rose 0.1% to 38831.48. Investors are focusing on U.S. tariff-related developments as well as earnings. USD/JPY is at 153.16, compared with 154.34 as of Tuesday 5 p.m. Eastern time. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield rises one basis point to 1.285%. (kosaku.narioka@wsj.com; @kosakunarioka)</p><p class=\"\">0717 GMT - The yuan may still face more downward pressure, Maybank's FX analysts say in a research report. \"China remains the only country that President Trump has allowed tariff to take effect on,\" the analysts say. \"Notwithstanding the fact that his trade policies and end goals remain murky at this stage, the developments thus far suggest that China is still taking the brunt of his trade policies,\" the analysts say. Taking into account the tariffs' deadlines, a scenario of an impasse on U.S.-China negotiations would probably prompt the PBOC to \"relent\" on USD/CNY fixings and allow USD/CNY to trend higher, the analysts add. USD/CNH is little changed at 7.2861. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0714 GMT - The impact of Trump's 10% tariff on Chinese exports on China's GDP growth this year looks manageable, Bank of Singapore chief economist Mansoor Mohi-uddin writes in a note. If the 10% levy is maintained for the rest of 2025, that would shave around 0.5% off China's GDP growth, he says. But if tariffs are raised to 20% to 30%, that would likely drag China's economic growth this year to 4.0% from 5.0% last year, he adds. That said, Beijing's retaliation, with targeted tariffs aimed at U.S. exports amounting to only $14 billion, leaves the door open for a potential deal with Washington to avert a broader trade war, he adds. (jiahui.huang@wsj.com; @ivy_jiahuihuang)</p><p class=\"\">0704 GMT - The 'tariff can' has just been kicked down the road, with the idea of imposing levies on U.S. imports from its two closest neighbours still not off the table entirely, says Pepperstone's Michael Brown. \"In fact, this whole saga could well rumble on until the start of April, when the review ordered by President Trump into U.S. trade policy is due to report back,\" the senior research strategist says in a note. Trump agreed to postpone the tariffs on Mexico and Canada for a month after talks with the leaders of both countries. \"Perhaps, it is at that point, that we will see tariffs shift from being used as a bargaining chip to further certain political aims, to actually being used as a measure to address trade imbalances,\" Brown says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0659 GMT - Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have dodged tariff bullets for now, but they shouldn't get too comfortable, Moody's Analytics economists say. The three appear obvious targets given their hefty trade surpluses with the U.S. One possible reason is security ties with the U.S. Another is the fact that Japan is among the U.S.'s biggest foreign investors. Korean and Taiwanese firms have been ramping up investment too. That's come at China's expense, aligning with the U.S. bid to curb its influence in supply chains, they add. But the mood could shift and tariffs could come. The economies also face collateral damage. Carmakers like Toyota and Kia have plants in Mexico, and Taiwanese and Korean chip and electronics producers in the U.S. face disruptions via trade barriers or surging production costs. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0649 GMT - South Korea's benchmark Kospi rose 1.1% to close at 2509.27 amid easing fears over U.S. tariffs. Foreign and institutional investors were net buyers. LG Energy Solution and Samsung SDI gained 3.6% and 3.4%, respectively, after the government prepared a new aid plan for the EV battery industry. Memory-chip maker SK Hynix added 4.0%. Mobile internet giant Kakao climbed 5.6% after agreeing to develop AI Products with OpenAI. Meanwhile, LG CNS, an IT service affiliate of LG Group, fell 9.9% on its stock exchange debut. USD/KRW settled 1.3% lower at 1,444.30 in Seoul onshore trading. South Korea's 10-year government bond yield was down 2.3 bps at 2.821%. (kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0518 GMT - Hong Kong could see a turnaround in retail sales this year on an estimated 25% increase in visitors to the city, with CGS International analysts projecting retail sales gain at 5% for 2025. The city's retail sales by value fell 7.3% in 2024.The easing of visa policies for mainland Chinese visitors to Hong Kong and continued increase in foreign tourists have boosted Hong Kong's visitor numbers, they add. The opening of Kai Tak Sports Park in March and multiple major events including concerts and sporting events should also attract high-spending tourists in 2025 and encourage local consumption, they say. There were encouraging signs in higher visitor numbers from China and other countries over the Lunar New Year holiday, which have boosted hotel bookings and luxury spending, CGS International says.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Santander posted a strong set of fourth-quarter results alongside guidance for 2025 and plans for capital returns to shareholders that are better than expected, Barclays's Cecilia Romero Reyes and Paola Sabbione say in a research note. The Spanish bank reported quarterly net profit and revenue that exceeded consensus forecasts, with results in Spain, Mexico, Brazil and the U.S. that were better than anticipated, Barclays says. The group's 2025 target for return on tangible equity--a profitability measure--of more than 17% is at the high end of previous guidance. Moreover, its intention to return 10 billion euros through buybacks is ahead of consensus expectations of 6 billion euros, according to Barclays. (adria.calatayud@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
