That came a year after it closed three tech offices and asked some staff to relocate to central corporate hubs.</p><p class=\"\">\"We are making these changes to put key capabilities together, encouraging speed and shared understanding,\" Morris said in the memo. \"Through this review process, we have eliminated some roles as we streamline how we work and will also be exiting our office in Charlotte, North Carolina.\"  </p><p class=\"\">Walmart, on Tuesday, did not specify the number of people being affected by the decision or the severance packages they will receive if they decide against relocating. Employees will be given a month to inform the company if they plan to move, the Fox News report said.</p><p class=\"\">Earlier this year, Walmart unveiled a new headquarter campus in northwest Arkansas, just a few miles from its previous location it called its \"Home Office.\" </p><p class=\"\">The expansive 350-acre campus is designed to accommodate over 15,000 employees across 12 buildings with move-ins planned to be completed by fiscal year 2026. </p><p class=\"\">The company is also opening new office spaces later this year in Sunnyvale, California and Bellevue, Washington and expanding and upgrading its office in Hoboken and its Fashion office in New York City, the memo said.  </p></span></div>",

Alphabet hasn't reported a growth rate that low since 2023.</p><p class=\"\">Shares in Alphabet were down 7% in after-hours trading following the earnings report, paring much of this year's gains of about 8%.</p><p class=\"\">Alphabet reported $26.6 billion of net income for the quarter, an increase of 28.3% from a year earlier.</p><p class=\"\">Large tech companies have been facing questions about their outsize spending on artificial intelligence after Chinese startup DeepSeek stunned Silicon Valley with powerful models built more cheaply than their American equivalents. Its chatbot app rocketed to the top of app store rankings, ahead of ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.</p><p class=\"\">But Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said Google was accelerating its investments in the data centers that power AI, both for his company and clients of its cloud-computing business. Pichai said Google would spend about $75 billion on capital expenditures this year, compared with $52.5 billion in 2024.</p><p class=\"\">Google's cloud-computing division underperformed Wall Street analysts' expectations last quarter, reporting $12 billion in fourth-quarter sales. That represented a growth rate of 30.1% from the same period a year earlier, a notable slowdown from the prior quarter.</p><p class=\"\">Executives have been hoping the cloud division's strength can help make up for slowing growth in Google's core advertising business. Competitors including Amazon and TikTok have been eating into Google's dominance in search advertising.</p><p class=\"\">Google was hit this week with  an antitrust investigation in China in retaliation for new tariffs President Trump imposed on goods from that country. China's antitrust regulator didn't provide any details about the probe, and Google declined to comment.</p><p class=\"\">In the U.S., Google is preparing to defend against a breakup the federal government is seeking of the company after a judge found it  has a monopoly in online search. Separately, a judge is expected to rule soon in  another antitrust lawsuit targeting Google's role facilitating ads on third-party websites.</p><p class=\"\">OpenAI has recently taken aim at Google's namesake search engine, giving ChatGPT the ability to search the web to answer questions. It released a feature called Deep Research this week that compiles in-depth reports using information from the web, mimicking a feature with the same name already available in Gemini .</p><p class=\"\">Pichai has set a goal of  reaching 500 million users for its Gemini chatbot by the end of the year. The company has been playing catch up to OpenAI since the startup released ChatGPT in late 2022.</p><p class=\"\">Google has been looking for ways to cut costs. It began offering voluntary buyouts last month to employees working on its Pixel devices and Android mobile software following a merger of the two groups under one leader last year.</p><p class=\"\">\"There's tremendous momentum on this team and with so much important work ahead, we want everyone to be deeply committed to our mission and focused on building great products, with speed and efficiency,\" a Google spokeswoman said.</p><p class=\"\">Google recently removed language from its website pledging to not build AI for weapons and \"other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people,\" according to screenshots viewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p class=\"\">It also removed a section forbidding \"technologies that cause or are likely to cause overall harm.\"</p><p class=\"\">Google executives wrote in a blog post published Tuesday that \"companies, governments, and organizations sharing these values should work together to create AI that protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security.\"</p><p class=\"\">Write to Miles Kruppa at miles.kruppa@wsj.com</p></span></div>",

We must not make assumptions, and Canada must not let its guard down.</p><p class=\"\">“These tariffs are not just an attack on Canada—they are an attack on all workers, both Canadian and American. They threaten our shared prosperity and inflict profound hardship on working families in both countries.</p><p class=\"\">“When the tariff threat eventually resurfaces, Canada will have to be ready with robust support measures for workers, and direct emergency programs for impacted sectors. Teamsters Canada will support a strong response, including ‘Buy Canadian’ campaigns.</p><p class=\"\">“Donald Trump has said that Canada is a ‘very tough’ country, and that the U.S. does not need Canada. Canada must now urgently work to develop new markets and diversify our exports. We have options! We are a reliable, trustworthy, and lucrative trading partner with much to offer the world. Expanding energy corridors, pipelines, and transportation infrastructure will be critical to ensuring Canadian goods and commodities reach new markets.</p><p class=\"\">“Clearly, this was never about fentanyl trafficking or illegal migrants from the north. Canada has been disrespected, threatened with annexation, and seen decades of friendship and alliance trampled.

In the fourth quarter 2024, we saw strong growth in virtually all loan categories, with total gross loans increasing by $51 million or 20% (annualized). Total deposits also increased in the fourth quarter by more than $53 million, mostly due to seasonal growth in money market and interest checking accounts. The increase in deposits coupled with investment securities sales and maturities this quarter helped fund loan growth and reduce expensive short-term borrowings. For the year, net interest income grew 5.6% over the previous year while in the fourth quarter 2024 our net interest margin improved to 3.51%. Strategic investments in our people and product offerings resulted in higher non-interest expenses, particularly in the fourth quarter.

The increase in net interest income was due mainly to lower interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds. The net interest margin increased to 3.51% during the fourth quarter from 3.30% during the prior quarter. Compared to the previous quarter, interest income on loans increased $22,000 to $16.0 million due to higher average balances but partially offset by lower yields on loans. Average loan balances increased $24.5 million while the average tax-equivalent yield on the loan portfolio decreased 15 basis points to 6.28%. Interest on investment securities declined slightly due to lower balances while partially offset by higher earning rates. Compared to the third quarter 2024, interest on deposits decreased $480,000, or 8.2% mainly due to lower rates, while interest on other borrowed funds declined by $363,000, due to lower rates and balances. The average rate on interest-bearing deposits decreased 23 basis points to 2.25% while the average rate on other borrowed funds decreased 51 basis points to 5.10% in the fourth quarter.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Non-Interest Income</strong></p><p class=\"\">Non-interest income totaled $3.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease of $882,000 from the previous quarter. The decrease in non-interest income during the fourth quarter of 2024 was primarily due to a $1.0 million loss on the sales of lower yielding investment securities mentioned above, while the third quarter of 2024 did not include any sales of investment securities. Additionally, lower sales of residential mortgages this quarter resulted in a decline of $182,000 in gains on sales of these mortgages. The decline in other non-interest income of $221,000 this quarter compared to the prior quarter resulted from sales of premises, equipment and foreclosed assets that did not re-occur in the current quarter. Partially offsetting those declines was an increase of $722,000 in bank owned life insurance income.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Non-Interest Expense</strong></p><p class=\"\">During the fourth quarter of 2024, non-interest expense totaled $11.9 million, an increase of $1.3 million compared to the prior quarter. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to increases of $470,000 in professional fees and $461,000 in compensation and benefits. The increase in professional fees this quarter was primarily due to higher consulting costs on several initiatives. The increase in compensation and benefits was attributable to an increase in employees and higher incentive compensation costs.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Income Tax Expense (Benefit)</strong></p><p class=\"\">Landmark recorded an income tax benefit of $886,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to income tax expense of $867,000 in the prior quarter. The effective tax rate was (37.0%) in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to 18.1% in the third quarter of 2024. The fourth quarter of 2024 included the recognition of $1.0 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits, which reduced the effective tax rate.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Balance Sheet Highlights</strong></p><p class=\"\">As of December 31, 2024, gross loans totaled $1.1 billion, an increase of $50.5 million, or 20.1% annualized since September 30, 2024. During the quarter, loan growth was primarily comprised of commercial real estate (growth of $21.1 million), commercial (growth of $10.7 million), agriculture (growth of $8.6 million) and one-to-four family residential real estate (growth of $7.8 million) loans. Investment securities decreased $38.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2024 and included sales of $36.0 million in low-rate U.S. treasury securities offset by purchases of $18.0 million in market rate U.S. treasury securities. Pre-tax unrealized net losses on the investment securities portfolio increased from $13.3 million at September 30, 2024 to $20.9 million at December 31, 2024 mainly due to higher market rates for these securities at year end.</p><p class=\"\">Period end deposit balances increased $53.3 million to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2024. The increase in deposits was mainly driven by an increase in money market and checking (increase of $71.3 million) but partially offset by declines in certificates of deposit (decrease of $9.2 million) and non-interest-bearing demand deposits (decrease of $8.6 million). The increase in money market and checking accounts was mainly driven by seasonal growth in public fund deposit account balances. Total borrowings decreased $34.7 million during the fourth quarter 2024. At December 31, 2024, the loan to deposits ratio was 78.2% compared to 77.6% in the prior quarter.</p><p class=\"\">Stockholders’ equity decreased to $136.2 million (book value of $23.59 per share) as of December 31, 2024, from $139.7 million (book value of $24.18 per share) as of September 30, 2024. The decrease in stockholders’ equity was due to an increase in accumulated other comprehensive losses as the unrealized net losses on investments securities increased during the fourth quarter. The ratio of equity to total assets decreased to 8.65% on December 31, 2024, from 8.93% on September 30, 2024.</p><p class=\"\">The allowance for credit losses totaled $12.8 million, or 1.22% of total gross loans on December 31, 2024, compared to $11.5 million, or 1.15% of total gross loans on September 30, 2024. Net loan charge-offs totaled $219,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $9,000 during the third quarter of 2024. A provision for credit losses for loans of $1.5 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $650,000 in the third quarter of 2024.</p><p class=\"\">Non-performing loans totaled $13.1 million, or 1.25% of gross loans at December 31, 2024 compared to $13.4 million, or 1.34% of gross loans at September 30, 2024. Loans 30-89 days delinquent declined to $6.2 million, or 0.59% of gross loans, as of December 31, 2024, compared to $7.3 million, or 0.73% of gross loans, as of September 30, 2024.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Landmark</strong></p><p class=\"\">Landmark Bancorp, Inc., the holding company for Landmark National Bank, is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “LARK.” Headquartered in Manhattan, Kansas, Landmark National Bank is a community banking organization dedicated to providing quality financial and banking services.
