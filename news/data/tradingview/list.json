Some of these items may not be applicable for the current quarter, however they may be part of our full-year results. Additionally, we have historically adjusted for certain items which are not described below, but for which we may adjust in a future period when applicable. Items applicable to the quarter or full year results, or the comparable periods, include the following:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Restructuring costs and transaction and transformation – Management believes it is appropriate to adjust for restructuring costs and transaction and transformation when they relate to a specific significant program with a defined set of activities and costs that are not expected to continue beyond a defined period of time, or significant acquisition-related transaction expenses. We believe the adjustment is necessary to present how the Company is performing, both now and in the future when the incurrence of these costs will have concluded.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Impairment – Adjustment to remove the non-cash goodwill impairment associated with our Benefits, Delivery and Administration reporting unit related to the sale of our TRANZACT business.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Provisions for specified litigation matters – We will include provisions for litigation matters which we believe are not representative of our core business operations. Among other things, we determine this by reference to the amount of the loss (net of insurance and other recovery receivables) and by reference to whether the matter relates to an unusual and complex scenario that is not expected to be repeated as part of our ongoing, ordinary business. These amounts are presented net of insurance and other recovery receivables. See the footnotes to the respective reconciliation tables below for more specificity on the litigation matter excluded from adjusted results.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Gains and losses on disposals of operations – Adjustment to remove the gains or losses resulting from disposed operations that have not been classified as discontinued operations.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Pension settlement – Adjustment to remove significant pension settlement to better present how the Company is performing.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Tax effect of significant adjustments – Relates to the incremental tax expense or benefit resulting from significant or unusual events including significant statutory tax rate changes enacted in material jurisdictions in which we operate, internal reorganizations of ownership of certain businesses that reduced the investment held by our U.S.-controlled subsidiaries and the recovery of certain refunds or payment of taxes related to businesses in which we no longer participate.</li></ul><p class=\"\">We evaluate our revenue on an as reported (U.S. GAAP), constant currency and organic basis. We believe presenting constant currency and organic information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our comparable results, consistent with how we evaluate our performance internally.</p><p class=\"\">We consider Constant Currency Change, Organic Change, Adjusted Operating Income/Margin, Adjusted EBITDA/Margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted Income Before Taxes, Adjusted Income Taxes/Tax Rate and Free Cash Flow to be important financial measures, which are used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating and liquidity results against our competitors. These non-GAAP measures are important in illustrating what our comparable operating and liquidity results would have been had we not incurred transaction-related and non-recurring items. Reconciliations of these measures are included in the accompanying tables with the following exception: The Company does not reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, due to variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections and/or certain information not being ascertainable or accessible; and because not all of the information, such as foreign currency impacts necessary for a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, is available to the Company without unreasonable efforts. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. The Company provides non-GAAP financial measures that it believes will be achieved, however it cannot accurately predict all of the components of the adjusted calculations and the U.S. GAAP measures may be materially different than the non-GAAP measures.</p><p class=\"\">Our non-GAAP measures and their accompanying definitions are presented as follows:</p><p class=\"\">Constant Currency Change – Represents the year-over-year change in revenue excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. To calculate this impact, the prior year local currency results are first translated using the current year monthly average exchange rates. The change is calculated by comparing the prior year revenue, translated at the current year monthly average exchange rates, to the current year as reported revenue, for the same period. We believe constant currency measures provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to performance by excluding the effects that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on period-over-period comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets.</p><p class=\"\">Organic Change – Excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as described above and the period-over-period impact of acquisitions and divestitures on current-year revenue. We believe that excluding transaction-related items from our U.S. GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to our investors, and it is important in illustrating what our core operating results would have been had we not included these transaction-related items, since the nature, size and number of these transaction-related items can vary from period to period.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted Operating Income/Margin – (Loss)/Income from operations adjusted for impairment, amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and transformation and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results. Adjusted operating income margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income by revenue. We consider adjusted operating income/margin to be important financial measures, which are used internally to evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA/Margin – Net (Loss)/Income adjusted for provision for income taxes, interest expense, impairment, depreciation and amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and transformation, gains and losses on disposals of operations and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by revenue. We consider adjusted EBITDA/margin to be important financial measures, which are used internally to evaluate and assess our core operations, to benchmark our operating results against our competitors and to evaluate and measure our performance-based compensation plans.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted Net Income – Net (Loss)/Income Attributable to WTW adjusted for impairment, amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and transformation, gains and losses on disposals of operations and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and the related tax effect of those adjustments and the tax effects of internal reorganizations. This measure is used solely for the purpose of calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share – Adjusted Net Income divided by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares, diluted. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted Income Before Taxes – (Loss)/Income from operations before income taxes adjusted for impairment, amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and transformation, gains and losses on disposals of operations and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results. Adjusted income before taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted Income Taxes/Tax Rate – Benefit from/(provision for) income taxes adjusted for taxes on certain items of impairment, amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and transformation, gains and losses on disposals of operations, the tax effects of internal reorganizations, and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results, divided by adjusted income before taxes. Adjusted income taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate. Management believes that the adjusted income tax rate presents a rate that is more closely aligned to the rate that we would incur if not for the reduction of pre-tax income for the adjusted items and the tax effects of internal reorganizations, which are not core to our current and future operations.</p><p class=\"\">Free Cash Flow – Cash flows from operating activities less cash used to purchase fixed assets and software for internal use. Free Cash Flow is a liquidity measure and is not meant to represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow presents the core operating performance and cash-generating capabilities of our business operations.</p><p class=\"\">Free Cash Flow Margin – Free Cash Flow as a percentage of revenue, which represents how much of revenue would be realized on a cash basis. We consider this measure to be a meaningful metric for tracking cash conversion on a year-over-year basis due to the non-cash nature of our pension income, which is included in our GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings metrics presented herein.</p><p class=\"\">These non-GAAP measures are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the information contained within our condensed consolidated financial statements.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">WTW Forward-Looking Statements</strong></p><p class=\"\">This document contains ‘forward-looking statements’ within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created by those laws.

You can obtain copies of Amcor's filings with the SEC for free at the SEC's website (www.sec.gov). Forward-looking statements included herein are made only as of the date hereof and Amcor does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, or any other information in this communication, as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, or to correct any inaccuracies or omissions in them which become apparent, except as expressly required by law. All forward-looking statements in this communication are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.</p><p class=\"\">Presentation of non-GAAP information</p><p class=\"\">Included in this release are measures of financial performance that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures include adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA (calculated as earnings before interest and tax and depreciation and amortization), adjusted EBIT and EBIT (calculated as earnings before interest and tax), adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow, net debt and synergies from the proposed Transaction.  In arriving at these non-GAAP measures, we exclude items that either have a non-recurring impact on the income statement or which, in the judgment of our management, are items that, either as a result of their nature or size, could, were they not singled out, potentially cause investors to extrapolate future performance from an improper base. Note that while amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded from non-GAAP adjusted financial measures, the revenue of the acquired entities and all other expenses unless otherwise stated, are reflected in our non-GAAP financial performance earnings measures. While not all inclusive, examples of these items include: material restructuring programs, including associated costs such as employee severance, pension and related benefits, impairment of property and equipment and other assets, accelerated depreciation, termination payments for contracts and leases, contractual obligations, and any other qualifying costs related to restructuring plans; material sales and earnings from disposed or ceased operations and any associated profit or loss on sale of businesses or subsidiaries; changes in the fair value of economic hedging instruments on commercial paper and contingent purchase consideration; pension settlements; impairments in goodwill and equity method investments; material acquisition compensation and transaction costs such as due diligence expenses, professional and legal fees, and integration costs; material purchase accounting adjustments for inventory; amortization of acquired intangible assets from business combination; gains or losses on significant property and divestitures and significant property and other impairments, net of insurance recovery; certain regulatory and legal matters; impacts from highly inflationary accounting; expenses related to the Company's Chief Executive Officer transition; and impacts related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p><p class=\"\">Amcor also evaluates performance on a comparable constant currency basis, which measures financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the average rates in effect for the comparable prior year period. In order to compute comparable constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, current-year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We then adjust for other items affecting comparability. While not all inclusive, examples of items affecting comparability include the difference between sales or earnings in the current period and the prior period related to disposed, or ceased operations. Comparable constant currency net sales performance also excludes the impact from passing through movements in raw material costs.</p><p class=\"\">Management has used and uses these measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performance of the Company's reporting segments and certain of the measures are used as a component of Amcor's Board of Directors' measurement of Amcor's performance for incentive compensation purposes. Amcor believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to enable investors to perform comparisons of current and historical performance of the Company. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure has been provided herein. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an alternative to results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome and timing of certain significant forward-looking items without unreasonable effort. These items include but are not limited to the impact of foreign exchange translation, restructuring program costs, asset impairments, possible gains and losses on the sale of assets, and certain tax related events. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP earnings and cash flow measures for the guidance period.</p><p class=\"\">This document also includes certain projections of non-GAAP financial measures related to the combined company after the consummation of the proposed Transaction. Due to the high variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections in connection with the results of the combined company after the consummation of the proposed Transaction, together with certain information excluded from these projected non-GAAP financial measures not being ascertainable or accessible, Amcor is unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures without unreasonable effort. Consequently, no disclosure of estimated comparable GAAP financial measures for such projected non-GAAP financial measures and no reconciliation of projected non-GAAP financial measure for the combined company to directly comparable GAAP measures has been included in this document.</p><p class=\"\">Important Information for Investors and Shareholders</p><p class=\"\">This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy or exchange any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval in any jurisdiction.

Our full year results were also strong, with record revenue(1), a 9.9% GAAP operating income margin and a 10.4% adjusted operating income margin(2),” said Jude Bricker, Chief Executive Officer of Sun Country. “We were an industry leader in making significant capacity adjustments in response to industry oversupply, particularly during off-peak periods. The capacity environment in the fourth quarter was more balanced and we see this continuing into the first quarter of 2025. The improved economics of our cargo business also contributed to our strong results in the second half of the year. As we move into 2025, we expect the favorable environment to continue, with strong unit revenue trends in our passenger business and the addition of eight more Amazon freighter aircraft to our fleet throughout the year. Our revenue streams are becoming even more diverse as we increase cargo flying, and our earnings are becoming more stable as more of our flying moves under contractual agreements.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Overview of Fourth Quarter and Full Year</strong></p><div class=\"tableWrapper-pIO_GYwT\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td> </td><td colspan=\"6\">Three Months Ended December 31,</td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>(unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts)</td><td colspan=\"3\">2024</td><td colspan=\"3\">2023</td><td colspan=\"2\">% Change</td></tr><tr><td>Total Operating Revenue</td><td>$</td><td>260.4</td><td> </td><td>$</td><td>245.5</td><td> </td><td>6.1</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Operating Income</td><td> </td><td>26.1</td><td> </td><td> </td><td>17.1</td><td> </td><td>52.2</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Income Before Income Tax</td><td> </td><td>16.9</td><td> </td><td> </td><td>7.7</td><td> </td><td>121.0</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Net Income</td><td> </td><td>13.4</td><td> </td><td> </td><td>5.6</td><td> </td><td>138.0</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Diluted earnings per share</td><td>$</td><td>0.24</td><td> </td><td>$</td><td>0.10</td><td> </td><td>140.0</td><td> </td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"tableWrapper-pIO_GYwT\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td> </td><td colspan=\"6\">Three Months Ended December 31,</td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>(unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts)</td><td colspan=\"3\">2024</td><td colspan=\"3\">2023</td><td colspan=\"2\">% Change</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted Operating Income (2)</td><td>$</td><td>27.5</td><td> </td><td>$</td><td>18.3</td><td> </td><td>50.6</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted Income Before Income Tax (2)</td><td> </td><td>18.9</td><td> </td><td> </td><td>9.3</td><td> </td><td>103.7</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted Net Income (2)</td><td> </td><td>15.0</td><td> </td><td> </td><td>6.9</td><td> </td><td>117.1</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted diluted earnings per share (2)</td><td>$</td><td>0.27</td><td> </td><td>$</td><td>0.12</td><td> </td><td>125.0</td><td> </td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"tableWrapper-pIO_GYwT\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td> </td><td colspan=\"6\">Year Ended December 31,</td><td colspan=\"2\"> </td></tr><tr><td>(unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts)</td><td colspan=\"3\">2024</td><td colspan=\"3\">2023</td><td colspan=\"2\">% Change</td></tr><tr><td>Total Operating Revenue</td><td>$</td><td>1,075.7</td><td> </td><td>$</td><td>1,049.6</td><td> </td><td>2.5</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Operating Income</td><td> </td><td>106.0</td><td> </td><td> </td><td>127.5</td><td> </td><td>(16.9</td><td>)</td></tr><tr><td>Income Before Income Tax</td><td> </td><td>69.6</td><td> </td><td> </td><td>94.2</td><td> </td><td>(26.1</td><td>)</td></tr><tr><td>Net Income</td><td> </td><td>52.9</td><td> </td><td> </td><td>72.2</td><td> </td><td>(26.7</td><td>)</td></tr><tr><td>Diluted earnings per share</td><td>$</td><td>0.96</td><td> </td><td>$</td><td>1.23</td><td> </td><td>(22.0</td><td>)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"tableWrapper-pIO_GYwT\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td> </td><td colspan=\"6\">Year Ended December 31,</td><td colspan=\"2\"> </td></tr><tr><td>(unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts)</td><td colspan=\"3\">2024</td><td colspan=\"3\">2023</td><td colspan=\"2\">% Change</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted Operating Income (2)</td><td>$</td><td>112.0</td><td> </td><td>$</td><td>136.8</td><td> </td><td>(18.1</td><td>)</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted Income Before Income Tax (2)</td><td> </td><td>76.1</td><td> </td><td> </td><td>104.2</td><td> </td><td>(26.9</td><td>)</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted Net Income (2)</td><td> </td><td>58.0</td><td> </td><td> </td><td>79.9</td><td> </td><td>(27.4</td><td>)</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted diluted earnings per share (2)</td><td>$</td><td>1.05</td><td> </td><td>$</td><td>1.37</td><td> </td><td>(23.4</td><td>)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"\">For the quarter ended December 31, 2024, Sun Country reported Income Before Income Tax of $16.9 million and Net Income of $13.4 million, on $260.4 million of revenue. Adjusted Income Before Income Tax for the quarter was $18.9 million(2). GAAP Operating Income during the quarter was $26.1 million, producing an Operating Income Margin of 10.0%, while Adjusted Operating Income was $27.5 million(2), resulting in an Adjusted Operating Income Margin of 10.6%(2).</p><p class=\"\">“Our fourth quarter results exceeded our initial expectations, and we achieved a higher total revenue and operating margin than we guided to at the beginning of the quarter,” said Dave Davis, President and Chief Financial Officer. “While fourth quarter passenger unit revenue was slightly less than flat year over year, we saw steady improvement throughout the quarter, with December scheduled service TRASM(3) increasing over 5% year-over-year on almost 8% ASM growth. Total fare for the fourth quarter increased 2.2% and we foresee positive fare trends continuing. In addition to improving revenue trends, our successful cost control efforts continue, with full year 2024 adjusted CASM(4) increasing only 1.3% over 2023. As Jude noted, we see strong first quarter 2025 bookings on mid-single digit growth in scheduled service ASMs. While we anticipate very rapid growth in our cargo segment in 2025, the timing of the new freighter deliveries should allow us to maximize scheduled service flying in the first quarter, our most profitable quarter.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Notable Highlights </strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Reached an agreement in principle on the collective bargaining agreement with flight attendants, represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and a tentative collective bargaining agreement with dispatchers, represented by the Transport Workers Union. The Company expects a ratification vote of both agreements by the end of the first quarter of 2025.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Extended lease return dates on existing leases for three 737-900ERs. Return dates for the four 737-900s currently on lease are expected to be in May, September and November 2025 and November 2026.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Appended a new C-tranche to our 2019-1 EETC raising $60 million, which was used in its entirety to pay down a significant portion of the term loan financing five 737-900ER aircraft. These transactions are expected to save approximately $0.8 million in interest expense in 2025.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Took delivery of one 737-900ER off lease in November 2024.

All of this growth was allocated to the passenger segment, resulting in a 3.5% increase in scheduled service ASMs and a 5.0% increase in charter block hours. Cargo block hours declined in the fourth quarter by 2.5% year-over-year due to normal quarterly fluctuations in the level of flying. For the first quarter of 2025, we expect total block hour growth of to be between 7% and 9%, with Scheduled Service ASMs growing by slightly more than 7% over first quarter 2024. Cargo flying is expected to increase substantially from the second quarter of 2025 onward.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Revenue </strong></p><p class=\"\">The passenger market improved throughout the fourth quarter, which resulted in scheduled service TRASM(3) declining by 1.0% on a 3.5% increase in scheduled service ASMs. December scheduled service TRASM(3) increased by over 5%. The Company reported total revenue of $260.4 million for the fourth quarter, which was 6.1% greater than the fourth quarter of 2023 and the highest fourth quarter on record(1). The Company’s fourth quarter charter service revenue was $48.0 million, an increase of 2.3% year-over-year, despite the impact of lower fuel cost reimbursements from our customers.</p><p class=\"\">In the fourth quarter of 2024, cargo revenue was the highest fourth quarter on record(1) at $28.6 million, a 13.1% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2023 on a 2.5% decline in cargo block hours. This improvement was primarily driven by the annual rate escalation which went into effect in mid-December 2023 and the first phase of the new Amazon contract rate increases which went into effect in June 2024.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Cost</strong></p><p class=\"\">Fourth quarter CASM fell 0.7% while adjusted CASM(4) was up 7.6% year-over-year on lower ASM growth than previous quarters.

Further, our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies. We believe certain charges included in our operating expenses on a GAAP basis make it difficult to compare our current period results to prior periods as well as future periods and guidance.

Some of the limitations applicable to these measures include: they do not reflect the impact of certain cash and non-cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and other companies in our industry may calculate these non-GAAP measures differently than we do, limiting each measure’s usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, the following non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to the possible differences in the method of calculation and in the items being adjusted.</p><p class=\"\">For the aforementioned reasons, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, Adjusted Income before Income Tax, Adjusted Pre-tax Margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income per Share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin have significant limitations which affect their use as indicators of our profitability.

Adjusted CASM is an important measure used by management and by our board of directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance. Adjusted CASM is also a measure commonly used by industry analysts and we believe it is an important metric by which they compare our airline to others in the industry, although other airlines may exclude certain other costs in their calculation of Adjusted CASM. The measure is also the subject of frequent questions from investors.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted CASM excludes fuel costs. By excluding volatile fuel costs that are outside of our control from our unit metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of operations and our non-fuel cost initiatives. Our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can lead to a significant improvement in operating results. In addition, we believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run, so it is important for management and investors to understand the impact and trends in company-specific cost drivers, such as labor rates, aircraft and maintenance costs, and productivity, which are more controllable by management.</p><p class=\"\">We have excluded costs related to the cargo operations, as well as depreciation and amortization recognized on certain assets that generate lease income as these operations do not create ASMs. The Company has entered into certain transactions where we act as a lessor. As of December 31, 2024, we leased or subleased six aircraft. Depreciation and Amortization on these aircraft materially began during the three months ended June 30, 2023. Adjusted CASM further excludes special items and other adjustments, as defined in the relevant reporting period, that are not representative of the ongoing costs necessary to our airline operations and may improve comparability between periods. We also exclude stock compensation expense when computing Adjusted CASM. The Company’s compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives and is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any period.</p><p class=\"\">As derivations of Adjusted CASM are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner. As a result, derivations of Adjusted CASM as presented may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Adjusted CASM should not be considered in isolation or as a replacement for CASM. For the aforementioned reasons, Adjusted CASM has significant limitations which affect its use as an indicator of our profitability. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information.</p><div class=\"tableWrapper-pIO_GYwT\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"16\"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"16\">Reconciliation of CASM to Adjusted CASM  Amounts may not recalculate due to rounding, dollar amounts in millions unless otherwise noted</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"16\">The following table presents the reconciliation of CASM to Adjusted CASM.</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td colspan=\"15\"> </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td colspan=\"15\">Three Months Ended December 31,</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td colspan=\"7\">2024</td><td> </td><td colspan=\"7\">2023</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td colspan=\"3\">Operating Expenses</td><td> </td><td colspan=\"3\">Per ASM (cents)</td><td> </td><td colspan=\"3\">Operating Expenses</td><td> </td><td colspan=\"3\">Per ASM (cents)</td></tr><tr><td>CASM</td><td>$</td><td>234.3</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td>11.94</td><td> </td><td> </td><td>$</td><td>228.4</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td>12.03</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Less:</td><td colspan=\"3\"> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td colspan=\"3\"> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Aircraft Fuel</td><td> </td><td>49.9</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td>2.54</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td>60.8</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td>3.20</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Stock Compensation Expense</td><td> </td><td>1.4</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td>0.08</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td>1.1</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td>0.06</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Cargo Expenses, Not Already Adjusted Above</td><td> </td><td>27.3</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td>1.39</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td>25.8</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td>1.36</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Sun Country Vacations</td><td> </td><td>0.2</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td>0.01</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td>0.2</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td>0.01</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Leased Aircraft, Depreciation Expense</td><td> </td><td>1.8</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td>0.09</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td>2.2</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td>0.12</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted CASM</td><td>$</td><td>153.7</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td>7.83</td><td> </td><td> </td><td>$</td><td>138.2</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td>7.28</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td colspan=\"3\"> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td colspan=\"3\"> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Available seat miles (ASMs) -

Adjusted EBITDA increased by 10% to $275 million compared to $251 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 170 basis points to 21.0%. Diluted earnings per share increased by 91% to $0.63 compared to $0.33 in the prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share improved by 30% to $0.60.</p><p class=\"\">Fourth quarter 2024 cash provided by operating activities was $234 million versus $286 million in the same period last year, with free cash flow totaling $177 million compared to $254 million in the prior year period. The year-over-year decrease in free cash flow was driven primarily by higher working capital and increased capital expenditures.</p><p class=\"\">The company's net debt to trailing twelve-month (\"LTM\") Adjusted EBITDA ratio (total net leverage ratio) was 2.5x at quarter-end versus 2.9x as of December 31, 2023. In the quarter, the company prioritized gross debt reduction, paying down the full $105 million remaining balance of the revolver draw used to finance the acquisition of CoverFlexx. Cash and cash equivalents at year end were $593 million, and total liquidity was $1.4 billion.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Discussion of Segment Results</strong></p><p class=\"\">Performance Coatings fourth quarter 2024 net sales were $843 million, down 1% from the prior year period as the contribution from CoverFlexx was more than offset by lower volumes and unfavorable impacts from foreign currency translation. Refinish net sales grew 2% year over year to $545 million driven by contributions from the CoverFlexx acquisition, favorable price-mix contribution, and net new body shop wins, partially offset by lower volumes in Europe and negative impacts from foreign currency translation. Industrial net sales decreased by 5% year over year to $298 million as favorable pricing was more than offset by lower volume from weak demand across most end businesses and foreign currency translation headwinds.</p><p class=\"\">The Performance Coatings segment generated Adjusted EBITDA of $198 million in the fourth quarter compared to $192 million in the prior year period, with Adjusted EBITDA margins of 23.5% and 22.6%, respectively. Lower variable costs, favorable price-mix and contributions from CoverFlexx drove the increases in segment Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin.</p><p class=\"\">Mobility Coatings fourth quarter 2024 net sales were $468 million, up 4% from the prior year period. Growth was driven predominantly by strong Light Vehicle volume performance in China and Latin America and favorable price-mix partially offset by declines in Commercial Vehicle volumes and foreign currency translation headwinds. Light Vehicle net sales increased 9% year over year driven by 6% volume growth and 5% favorable price-mix impact, which more than offset headwinds from foreign exchange translation. Commercial Vehicle net sales decreased by 10% year over year to $99 million led by anticipated lower volumes from Class 8 builds in North America and Latin America and foreign currency headwinds.</p><p class=\"\">Mobility Coatings generated Adjusted EBITDA of $77 million in the fourth quarter compared to $59 million in the prior year period, with Adjusted EBITDA margins of 16.4% and 13.2%, respectively. The increases in segment Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin were driven primarily by positive price-mix contribution, volume growth and savings from the 2024 Transformation initiative partially offset by labor inflation.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Fiscal Year </strong><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">2024</strong><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"> Consolidated Financial Results</strong></p><p class=\"\">For the full year 2024, net sales increased 2% year over year to $5.3 billion.</p><p class=\"\">Net income improved to $391 million versus $269 million in 2023, resulting in a net income margin of 7.4%, an increase of 220 basis points versus the prior year. The net income increase was driven primarily by lower variable costs, sales growth inclusive of contributions from acquisitions, lower consulting and enterprise resource planning system implementation spending and savings from the 2024 Transformation Initiative partially offset by labor inflation and increased restructuring costs. Adjusted net income improved by $144 million year over year to $518 million. Adjusted EBITDA improved to $1,116 million, increasing 17% when compared to fiscal year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 280 basis points to 21.2% versus the prior year with expansion in both segments. Diluted EPS per share increased by 47% to $1.78 compared to $1.21 in the prior year period. Adjusted Diluted EPS improved by 40% to $2.35.</p><p class=\"\">Fiscal year 2024 cash provided by operating activities was $576 million versus $575 million in the prior year as earnings growth was mostly offset by higher working capital. Free cash flow totaled $451 million compared to $447 million in 2023, an increase of $4 million.</p><p class=\"\">“Axalta's 2024 financial results were exceptional. We delivered record net sales and Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter and full year in a challenging macro environment,” said Chris Villavarayan, Axalta’s CEO and President. “Consistent outperformance in Refinish and Light Vehicle and excellent execution across the company, resulted in an Adjusted EBITDA margin of over 21% as we continue down the path to delivering against our commitments outlined in the 2026 A Plan.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Non-GAAP </strong><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Reporting</strong><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"> Changes</strong></p><p class=\"\">Beginning with the results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024 reported in this release, we have made changes to our presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted Net Income (which is also leveraged in the calculation of Adjusted Diluted EPS).

Axalta has identified some of these forward-looking statements with words such as “commitments,” “guidance,” “outlook,” and “projection,” and the negative of these words or other comparable or similar terminology. All of these statements are based on management’s expectations as well as estimates and assumptions prepared by management that, although they believe to be reasonable, are inherently uncertain. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, economic, competitive, governmental and technological factors outside of Axalta’s control, as well as risks related to the execution of, and assumptions underlying, the 2024 Transformation Initiative and the 2026 A Plan, that may cause its business, industry, strategy, financing activities or actual results to differ materially. More information on potential factors that could affect Axalta’s financial results is available in “Forward-Looking Statements,” “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” within Axalta’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and in other documents that we have filed with, or furnished to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Axalta undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Final results for the full year, which will be reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, may vary from the information in this release. In particular, until our financial statements are issued in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, we may be required to recognize certain subsequent events (such as in connection with contingencies or the realization of assets) which could affect our final results.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Non-GAAP Financial Measures</strong></p><p class=\"\">This release includes financial information that is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Diluted EPS, adjusted net income, Free Cash Flow, total net leverage ratio, tax rate, as adjusted, and Adjusted EBIT. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Diluted EPS, adjusted net income, tax rate, as adjusted, and Adjusted EBIT in the analysis of our financial and operating performance because they assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our business. Management uses Free Cash Flow and total net leverage ratio in the analysis of (1) our liquidity, (2) our ability to incur and service our debt and (3) strategic capital allocation decisions. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Diluted EPS, adjusted net income, and Adjusted EBIT consist of EBITDA, Diluted EPS, net income attributable to common shareholders, and EBIT, respectively, adjusted for (i) certain non-cash items included within net income, (ii) certain items Axalta does not believe are indicative of ongoing operating performance or (iii) certain nonrecurring, unusual or infrequent items that have not otherwise occurred within the last two years or we believe are not reasonably likely to recur within the next two years. Free cash flow consists of cash provided by (used for) operating activities less purchase of property, plant and equipment plus interest proceeds on swaps designated as net investment hedges. Total net leverage ratio consists of net debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA, with net debt defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents. We believe that making the foregoing adjustments provides investors meaningful information to understand our operating results and ability to analyze financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis. The non-GAAP financial measures used by Axalta may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Diluted EPS, adjusted net income, Free Cash Flow, total net leverage ratio, tax rate, as adjusted, and Adjusted EBIT should not be considered as alternatives to net sales, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations or any other financial measures derived in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures have important limitations as analytical tools and should be considered in conjunction with, and not as substitutes for, our results as reported under GAAP. This release includes a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Axalta does not provide a reconciliation for Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Diluted EPS, tax rate, as adjusted, or Free Cash Flow on a forward-looking basis because the information necessary to calculate a meaningful or accurate estimation of reconciling items is not available without unreasonable effort. For example, such reconciling items include the impact of foreign currency exchange gains or losses, gains or losses that are unusual or nonrecurring in nature, as well as discrete taxable events. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors and may have a substantial and unpredictable impact on our GAAP results.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Segment Financial Measures </strong></p><p class=\"\">The primary measure of segment operating performance is Adjusted EBITDA, which is a key metric that is used by management to evaluate business performance in comparison to budgets, forecasts and prior year financial results and that management believes reflects Axalta’s core operating performance. As we do not measure segment operating performance based on net income, a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure with the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is not available. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2023, we replaced Adjusted EBIT with Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measure of segment operating performance. As previously disclosed, we have published segment Adjusted EBIT through 2024 to allow for historical trend analyses.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Defined Terms</strong></p><p class=\"\">All capitalized terms contained within this release that are not otherwise defined herein have been previously defined in our filings with the SEC.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Rounding</strong></p><p class=\"\">Certain amounts may not foot or crossfoot due to rounding. Additionally, certain percentages may not recalculate due to rounding.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Axalta Coating Systems </strong></p><p class=\"\">Axalta is a global leader in the coatings industry, providing customers with innovative, colorful, beautiful and sustainable coatings solutions.
