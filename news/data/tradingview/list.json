(NYSE-PKE) announced that, with today’s payment of the regular cash dividend of $0.125 per share, the Company has now paid $601.1 Million in cash dividends, or $29.35 per share, since the beginning of the Company’s 2005 fiscal year. Today’s dividend was declared on December 9, 2024 and was payable to shareholders of record at the close of business January 3, 2025.</p><p class=\"\">Park has paid 40 consecutive years of regular quarterly cash dividends, without ever skipping a dividend payment or reducing the amount of the dividend…not after 9/11, not after the Dot Com collapse, not during the pandemic, not ever.</p><p class=\"\">Brian E. Shore, Park’s Chairman and CEO, said, “$600 plus million of cash dividends since the beginning of our 2005 fiscal year is a hell of a lot of money for a small company like Park which was started back in 1954 in a garage in Queens, New York by two young guys from Brooklyn who grew up in the depression. According to legend, Jerry and Tony started Park with 40,000 bucks they had saved up from their war duty pay.”</p><p class=\"\">Park Aerospace Corp. develops and manufactures solution and hot-melt advanced composite materials used to produce composite structures for the global aerospace markets. Park’s advanced composite materials include film adhesives (Aeroadhere®) and lightning strike protection materials (Electroglide®). Park offers an array of composite materials specifically designed for hand lay-up or automated fiber placement (AFP) manufacturing applications. Park’s advanced composite materials are used to produce primary and secondary structures for jet engines, large and regional transport aircraft, military aircraft, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs commonly referred to as “drones”), business jets, general aviation aircraft and rotary wing aircraft. Park also offers specialty ablative materials for rocket motors and nozzles and specially designed materials for radome applications. As a complement to Park’s advanced composite materials offering, Park designs and fabricates composite parts, structures and assemblies and low volume tooling for the aerospace industry. Target markets for Park’s composite parts and structures (which include Park’s proprietary composite SigmaStrut™ and AlphaStrut™ product lines) are, among others, prototype and development aircraft, special mission aircraft, spares for legacy military and civilian aircraft and exotic spacecraft.

In a move that wasn't explicitly tied to Trump's tariffs, China also said it was starting an antitrust probe into Alphabet's Google, the internet search engine.</p><p class=\"\">Beijing added two U.S. companies to its unreliable entity list — Calvin Klein owner PVH, and biotechnology company Illumina.</p><p class=\"\">\"The two entities have violated normal market-trading principles, terminated regular trade with Chinese companies, and adopted discriminatory measures against Chinese companies,\" state-owned news agency Xinhua reported, citing a statement from the Commerce Ministry.</p><p class=\"\">The ministry said the list only targets the very few foreign entities that undermine China's national security. It means measures could be taken against the companies.</p><p class=\"\">PVH told Barron's the company is \"surprised and deeply disappointed\" by the decision.</p><p class=\"\">China also announced export controls on scarce elements that are critical for making electronics, including tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum, and indium. China is a big miner of these materials.</p><p class=\"\">The moves follow a last minute delay to Trump's plans to raise taxes on imports from Mexico and Canada. That sparked a relief rally in stocks, which had fallen sharply on concern that the new tariffs would fan inflation and hamper economic growth. The question now is whether Trump and China can work out a similar deal to prevent the trade war from escalating further.</p><p class=\"\">\"For the most part, these moves are warnings that China intends to harm U.S. interests if need be but still give China the option to back down,\" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics. \"The tariffs could be postponed or cancelled before they come into effect\" on Feb. 10.</p><p class=\"\">Evans-Pritchard also noted that the Chinese retaliation only targets about $20 billion worth of imports, compared to the $450 billion in Chinese wares that Trump has targeted. What's more, China didn't raise tariffs on strategic goods such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.com and Callum Keown at callum.keown@dowjones.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Kennedy Jr.'s health secretary nomination to head to a full Senate vote, pushing him a major step closer to confirmation.</p><p class=\"\">The committee voted Tuesday to favorably refer Trump's Health and Human Services secretary nominee — a strident critic of vaccines and a skeptic of their vaccine — to the Senate. Drug and food stocks stumbled after the panel's vote, as the once unthinkable notion of Kennedy leading the federal government's public health bureaucracy moved closer to reality.</p><p class=\"\">Shares of Pfizer, a major vaccine maker, fell from $26.25 ahead of the vote to $25.66 immediately after, a 2.2% drop.

The vote was split along party lines, with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent, voting with the Democrats.</p><p class=\"\">Cassidy could still vote against Kennedy when the full Senate votes. He arrived late to Tuesday's committee meeting, and left without making any comments on his vote.

Robinhood said it had made the football event contracts available to about 1% of its customers and \"for those who already placed trades, we plan on providing the option to close their positions or take them to resolution.\"</p><p class=\"\">Event contracts have proven popular with investors who traded hundreds of millions of contracts last year with regard to the presidential election.

The potential for 25% tariffs on imports to the U.S. on Canadian and Mexican products has weighed on Hammond stock, he notes. </p><p class=\"\">Most competing transformers used in the U.S. are made in Mexico, and as a result, tariffs should drive prices higher but not without a transitory margin impact. HPS shares were also pressured by news on DeepSeek's new LLM model, but Merer sees no reason to change his thesis. </p><p class=\"\">Target lowered to $170, from $175. Maintain Outperform. </p><p class=\"\">\"While we are lowering out target, the shares are down ~20% from the start of the year, and we believe the negative news is priced in.\"</p></span></div>",
