            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Multi-pronged media campaign to raise awareness about the disease and its impact on patients, family members and caregivers.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Interactive, stand-alone NETHERTON NOW website launched.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Quoin’s QRX003 product is on track to obtain the first regulatory approval for Netherton Syndrome.</li></ul><p class=\"\">ASHBURN, Va., Feb.  04, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Quoin Pharmaceuticals Ltd.  (the “Company” or “Quoin”), a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on rare and orphan diseases, has launched the “NETHERTON NOW” campaign to shed light on the profound and poorly understood impacts of Netherton Syndrome, a devastating genetic disease that has been significantly misdiagnosed in the past. It is estimated that up to 20% of babies born with Netherton Syndrome do not survive, highlighting the urgent need for greater awareness and new treatment options.</p><p class=\"\">Netherton Syndrome patients suffer from excess skin shedding as well as red, scaly skin that can cause painful itching and severe infections that can potentially lead to hospitalization, asthma, allergies and possibly skin cancer. They are also susceptible to water loss through the skin’s surface and are always at risk of dehydration. This chronic condition severely impacts every aspect of life for patients and their families, yet it remains inadequately understood and poorly addressed by current treatment options.</p><p class=\"\">Currently, Quoin is conducting four ongoing clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of QRX003, in Netherton Syndrome patients. Recently announced clinical data by Quoin has underscored the product’s potential efficacy as a treatment for the disease. Quoin has also released photographic evidence highlighting the dramatic impact on a patient’s skin after 12 weeks of dosing with QRX003. These photographs are accessible via this link. https://quoinpharma.com/pipeline/#trials </p><p class=\"\">“The positive clinical data we’ve shared recently provides significant validation for QRX003 as a potentially safe and effective treatment for Netherton Syndrome,” said Quoin CEO Dr. Michael Myers. “We are eagerly anticipating the initiation of our ‘whole body’ clinical study, which will be conducted by Dr. Amy Paller at Northwestern University. This groundbreaking study, which has been cleared to proceed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is a landmark event in the clinical development of QRX003. As we continue to assemble a robust data package in support of our regulatory approval filings in the US, EU and in the 61 countries where we have established commercial partnerships, our commitment to the Netherton community is unwavering. Hearing from patients every day about the frustrations and challenges of living with this disease further fuels our determination to deliver a safe and effective treatment that can deliver hope where there is currently none.”</p><p class=\"\">The NETHERTON NOW website serves as a comprehensive resource hub, providing a platform for patients and families to share experiences and build connections, while also offering educational materials and updates on research advancements to raise public awareness about Netherton Syndrome.</p><p class=\"\">Quoin Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer Denise Carter said, “We regularly hear from members of the Netherton community about their deep sense of feeling unseen, unheard, and ignored. Because of the lack of awareness about Netherton Syndrome, it can sometimes take months, and even years, before these patients are properly diagnosed, and once they have that diagnosis, they are informed that there is currently no approved treatment or cure. One key goal of our NETHERTON NOW campaign is to shine a spotlight on the urgent need for a better understanding of the profound physical, emotional, and social challenges people with this disease face every day. With the launch of the ‘NETHERTON NOW’ campaign, we aim not only to raise awareness but also to foster advocacy, education, and compassion for those affected by this devastating disease. We continue to collaborate closely with clinicians, patients, families, and advocacy groups, and we deeply value the insights and the support these communities have provided in our efforts to bring hope to those impacted by the disease.</p><p class=\"\">“Until there is an FDA-approved therapy for Netherton Syndrome, we remain steadfast in our mission to bring this disease out of the shadows and in our unwavering commitment to delivering solutions that address it at its core. The time to act is now—because everyone deserves to feel comfortable in their own skin.”</p><p class=\"\">Patients and families interested in participating in clinical studies or receiving updates can sign up for alerts at nethertonnow.com.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Netherton Syndrome</strong></p><p class=\"\">Netherton Syndrome, a form of Ichthyosis, is a rare hereditary skin disorder caused by a mutation in the SPINK5 gene (serine protease inhibitor, Kazal Type 5) that leads to severe skin barrier defects and recurring infections, as well as a pronounced predisposition to allergies, asthma, and eczema. Patients often suffer from severe dehydration, chronic skin inflammation and stunted growth. Currently, there is no cure for Netherton Syndrome, nor are there any approved therapeutic treatments.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About QRX003</strong></p><p class=\"\">QRX003 is a topical lotion formulated with a proprietary delivery technology that contains a broad-spectrum serine protease inhibitor, whose mechanism of action is intended to perform the function of a specific protein called LEKTI. The absence of LEKTI in Netherton patients leads to excessive skin shedding, resulting in a highly porous and compromised skin barrier. QRX003 is designed to promote a more normalized skin-shedding process and the formation of a stronger and more effective skin barrier.</p><p class=\"\">For more information about Quoin’s current clinical trials please visit: https://quoinpharma.com/pipeline/#trials</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Quoin Pharmaceuticals Ltd.</strong></p><p class=\"\">Quoin Pharmaceuticals Ltd. is a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic products that treat rare and orphan diseases.

These non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial information and financial outlook presented in this press release that is calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and these non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management believes that they supplement or enhance management's, analysts' and investors' overall understanding of the Company's underlying financial performance and trends and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods.</p><p class=\"\">Because the non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered superior to and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP financial measures presented in the press release and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in the method of calculation and in the items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.</p><p class=\"\">EBITDAR which is defined as Operating income (loss), plus depreciation, amortization, interest, taxes and aircraft rent is an important metric to be considered to allow investors to compare results across different airlines regardless of how the airlines acquired their aircraft. This distinction is important when comparing the operational results of an airline leasing its aircraft versus an airline purchasing its aircraft. Specifically, the airline leasing aircraft would see the costs relating to those aircraft flow through aircraft rent, while an airline that owns their aircraft would see their costs for those aircraft flow through depreciation and amortization. In order to compare the operating results of the two airlines an investor needs to look at EBITDAR which is why it is presented.</p><p class=\"\">A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due as management believes creation of this reconciliation would not be practicable due to the uncertainty regarding, and potential variability of, material reconciling items.</p><p class=\"\">Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information</p><p class=\"\">This press release contains certain “forward-looking statements” and “forward-looking information”, as defined under applicable United States and Canadian securities laws, concerning anticipated developments and events that may occur in the future.

Organic net sales decreased 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, while acquisitions added 9%. Grid Infrastructure net sales increased approximately 12% and Grid Automation net sales decreased by approximately 11%. Segment operating income in the fourth quarter of 2024 was $166 million, or 19.6% of net sales, compared to $143 million, or 17.6% of net sales in the same period of 2023. Adjusted operating income was $194 million, or 22.9% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to $174 million, or 21.4% of net sales in the same period of the prior year. Changes in operating income and operating margin were primarily due to the impact of acquisitions, price/cost/productivity management, prior year investments and favorable business mix, partially offset by volume declines.</p><p class=\"\">Electrical Solutions segment net sales in the fourth quarter of 2024 decreased to $487 million compared to $534 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Organic net sales decreased 1% in the quarter, while a divestiture reduced segment net sales by 8%. Segment operating income in the fourth quarter of 2024 was $92 million, or 19.0% of net sales, compared to $83 million, or 15.5% of net sales in the same period of 2023. Adjusted operating income was $97 million, or 20.0% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to $88 million, or 16.5% of net sales in the same period of the prior year. Changes in operating income and operating margin were driven primarily by portfolio transformation and favorable business mix, price/cost/productivity management and business simplification initiatives.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted diluted EPS in the fourth quarter 2024 excludes $0.44 of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.02 of transaction, integration, and separation costs. Adjusted diluted EPS in the fourth quarter 2023 results exclude $0.32 of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.21 of transaction, integration, and separation costs.</p><p class=\"\">Net cash provided by operating activities was $432 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 versus $346 million in the comparable period of 2023.

Hubbell expects 2025 GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $16.00 to $16.50 and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (“Adjusted EPS”) in the range of $17.35 to $17.85. Adjusted EPS excludes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, which the Company expects to be approximately $1.35 per share for the full year. The Company believes Adjusted EPS is a useful measure of underlying financial performance in light of our acquisition strategy.</p><p class=\"\">The diluted earnings per share and Adjusted EPS ranges are based on an adjusted tax rate of 22.0 to 22.5% and include approximately $20 million of anticipated restructuring and related investment.

In addition, statements related to our long-term financial framework achieving differentiated long-term performance for shareholders, our outlook for 2025+, and all statements set forth in the “Summary &amp; Outlook” section above, as well as other statements that are not strictly historic in nature are forward-looking. These statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “depend”, “plan”, “estimated”, “predict”, “target”, “should”, “could”, “may”, “subject to”, “continues”, “growing”, “prospective”, “forecast”, “projected”, “purport”, “might”, “if”, “contemplate”, “potential”, “pending”, “target”, “goals”, “scheduled”, “will”, “will likely be”, and similar words and phrases. Such forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and involve numerous assumptions, known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual and future performance or the Company’s achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: business conditions, geopolitical conditions (including the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as trade tensions with China) and changes in general economic conditions in particular industries, markets or geographic regions, and ongoing softness in the telecommunication markets and residential market of Electrical Solutions, as well as the potential for a significant economic slowdown, macro-economic effects of the U.S. government federal deficit, continued inflation, stagflation or recession, higher interest rates, and higher energy costs; our ability to offset increases in material and non-material costs through price recovery and volume growth; effects of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and the potential use of hedging instruments to hedge the exposure to fluctuating rates of foreign currency exchange on inventory purchases; the outcome of contingencies or costs compared to amounts provided for such contingencies, including those with respect to pension withdrawal liabilities; achieving sales levels to meet revenue expectations; unexpected costs or charges, certain of which may be outside the Company’s control; the effects of significant increases in trade tariffs, import quotas and other trade restrictions or actions taken by the United States, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and other countries, including changes in U.S. trade policies that may be made by the current or a future presidential administration and changes in trade policies in other countries made in response to changes in U.S. trade policies; failure to achieve projected levels of efficiencies, cost savings and cost reduction measures, including those expected as a result of our lean initiatives and strategic sourcing plans, regulatory issues, changes in tax laws and policies including changes in current U.S. income tax rates, multijurisdictional implementation of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s comprehensive base erosion and profit shifting plan, or changes in geographic profit mix affecting tax rates and availability of tax incentives; the impact of and ability to fully manage and integrate acquired businesses, including the 2023 acquisitions of EI Electronics LLC, Indústria Eletromecânica Balestro Ltda.; and Northern Star Holdings, Inc. (the Systems Control business), as well as the failure to realize expected synergies and benefits anticipated when we make an acquisition due to potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships resulting from completion of the transaction, competitive responses to the transaction, the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the transaction are not realized when expected or at all, including as a result of the impact of, or problems arising from, the integration of the acquired business, diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities, and litigation relating to the transaction; the impact of certain divestitures, including the benefits and costs of the sale of the residential lighting business; the ability to effectively develop and introduce new products, expand into new markets and deploy capital; and other factors described in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including in the “Business”, “Risk Factors”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” sections in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About the Company</strong></p><p class=\"\">Hubbell Incorporated is a leading manufacturer of utility and electrical solutions enabling customers to operate critical infrastructure safely, reliably and efficiently.

Management believes these adjusted operating measures provide useful information regarding our underlying performance from period to period and an understanding of our results of operations without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. Adjusted operating measures are non-GAAP measures, and include adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributed to Hubbell Incorporated, adjusted net income available to common shareholders, adjusted earnings per diluted share, and Adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP measures exclude, where applicable:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Amortization of all intangible assets associated with our business acquisitions, including inventory step-up amortization associated with those acquisitions. The intangible assets associated with our business acquisitions arise from the allocation of the purchase price using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 805, “Business Combinations.” These assets consist primarily of customer relationships, developed technology, trademarks and tradenames, and patents, as reported in Note 7—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, under the heading “Total Definite-Lived Intangibles,” within the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements set forth in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2023. The Company excludes these non-cash expenses because we believe it (i) enhances management’s and investors’ ability to analyze underlying business performance, (ii) facilitates comparisons of our financial results over multiple periods, and (iii) provides more relevant comparisons of our results with the results of other companies as the amortization expense associated with these assets may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the timing, size, nature, and number of acquisitions. Although we exclude amortization of these acquired intangible assets and inventory step-up from our non-GAAP results, we believe that it is important for investors to understand that revenue generated, in part, from such intangibles is included within revenue in determining adjusted net income attributable to Hubbell Incorporated.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Transaction, integration, and separation costs associated with our business acquisitions and divestitures. The effects that acquisitions and divestitures may have on our results fluctuate significantly based on the timing, size, and number of transactions, and therefore results in significant volatility in the costs to complete transactions and integrate or separate the businesses. The size of acquisition and divestiture actions taken by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2023 has resulted in a significant increase in these costs, as a result we believe excluding costs, relating to these fourth quarter transactions provides useful and more comparative information to investors to better assess our operating performance.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Gains or losses from the disposition of a business. The Company excludes these gains or losses because we believe it enhances management's and investors' ability to analyze underlying business performance and facilitates comparisons of our financial results over multiple periods. In the first quarter of 2024 the Company recognized a $5.3 million pre-tax loss on the disposition of the residential lighting business.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">The income tax effect directly related to the disposition of the residential lighting business. In the first quarter of 2024 the Company recognized $6.8 million of income tax expense on the sale of the residential lighting business, primarily driven by differences between book and tax basis in goodwill.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Income tax effects of the above adjustments, which are calculated using the statutory tax rate, taking into consideration the nature of the item and the relevant taxing jurisdiction, unless otherwise noted. </li></ul><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the items noted above and also excludes the Other income (expense), net, Interest expense, net, and Provision for income taxes captions of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income, as well as depreciation and amortization expense.</p><p class=\"\">Net debt (defined as total debt less cash and investments) to total capital is a non-GAAP measure that we believe is a useful measure for evaluating the Company's financial leverage and the ability to meet its funding needs.</p><p class=\"\">Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure that we believe provides useful information regarding the Company's ability to generate cash without reliance on external financing. In addition, management uses free cash flow to evaluate the resources available for investments in the business, strategic acquisitions and further strengthening the balance sheet.</p><p class=\"\">In connection with our restructuring and related actions we have incurred restructuring costs as defined by U.S. GAAP, which are primarily severance and employee benefits, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation, as well as facility closure, contract termination and certain pension costs that are directly related to restructuring actions. We also incur restructuring-related costs, which are costs associated with our business transformation initiatives, including the consolidation of back-office functions and streamlining our processes, and certain other costs and gains associated with restructuring actions. We refer to these costs on a combined basis as \"restructuring and related costs\", which is a non-GAAP measure.</p><p class=\"\">Organic net sales, a non-GAAP measure, represents net sales according to U.S. GAAP, less net sales from acquisitions and divestitures during the first twelve months of ownership or divestiture, respectively, less the effect of fluctuations in net sales from foreign currency exchange. The period-over-period effect of fluctuations in net sales from foreign currency exchange is calculated as the difference between local currency net sales of the prior period translated at the current period exchange rate as compared to the same local currency net sales translated at the prior period exchange rate. We believe this measure provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying operating results and trends of established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions and foreign currency, as these activities can obscure underlying trends. When comparing net sales growth between periods excluding the effects of acquisitions, business dispositions and currency exchange rates, those effects are different when comparing results for different periods. For example, because net sales from acquisitions are considered inorganic from the date we complete an acquisition through the end of the first year following the acquisition, net sales from such acquisition are reflected as organic net sales thereafter.</p><p class=\"\">There are limitations to the use of non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP measures do not present complete financial results. We compensate for this limitation by providing a reconciliation between our non-GAAP financial measures and the respective most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, as substitutes for, or alternative measures of, reported GAAP financial results, and should be viewed in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures and the provided reconciliations thereto. We believe, however, that these non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed together with our GAAP results and related reconciliations, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure.</p><p class=\"\">Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found in the tables below. When we provide our expectations for organic net sales, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted diluted EPS and free cash flow on a forward-looking basis, a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectations and the corresponding GAAP measures (expected net sales, effective tax rate, diluted EPS and net cash flows provided by operating activities) generally is not available without unreasonable effort due to potentially high variability, complexity and low visibility as to the items that would be excluded from the GAAP measure in the relevant future period, such as unusual gains and losses, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the impact and timing of potential acquisitions and divestitures, certain financing costs, and other structural changes or their probable significance. The variability of the excluded items may have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future GAAP results.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">HUBBELL
