Year to date, shares have fallen 3.7%.</p><p class=\"\">The telecommunications company said revenue in Germany fell 7.6% on a reported basis to 3.09 billion euros ($3.20 billion). Service revenue--a closely watched metric in the telecom sector--in the country represents 34% of group service revenue and fell 6.4% to 2.89 billion euros for the quarter ended Dec. 31. This was partly due to the expected impact from German regulatory changes, which prevent landlords from bundling TV services with rental agreements, as well as lower broadband customer base.</p><p class=\"\">Germany's turnaround will take time as the group is still absorbing the impact of the law change and face a highly competitive market environment, Chief Executive Margherita Della Valle said on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"\">Meanwhile, U.K. service revenue climbed 3.3% on organic basis to 1.51 billion euros, boosted by significant investments in customer experience.

This was driven by service revenue growth in most markets and lower energy costs in Europe that offset the law impact in Germany. Revenue rose to 9.81 billion euros from 9.35 million euros.</p><p class=\"\">This represents the first set of earnings following the group's exit from Italy. Vodafone sale of the Italian business to Swisscom was approved by Italy's competition regulator in the quarter, marking the final step for getting full clearance.

Trump's plan to talk with Beijing raised hopes for a U.S.-China tariff reprieve, FSMOne analyst Alwyn Chew Chuan Shyn says. For now, the market doesn't seem too concerned that China announced retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods, he adds. Still, Chew expects volatility in the local market to rise as investors closely monitor the U.S. and Malaysian earnings seasons and Trump's foreign policies. He sees support for the KLCI at 1535 and resistance at 1590. Among gainers, CIMB Group rose 2.4% and Sunway Bhd. climbed 2.3%.

The French bank's quarterly result as well as it CET1 ratio exceeded expectations, the analyst says. The bank's new 2024-2026 net income growth rate target suggests at least a 4% consensus upgrade, Reingen says. The slight fall in the bank's 2025 return on tangible equity to 11.5% from a range of 11.5% to 12% previously, given consensus expectations at 10.4%, should offer relief to investors fearing a steeper downgrade.

BNP Paribas's investment and protection services unit disappointed but the business should benefit later this year from external growth, the analyst says.

Diageo's decision to remove medium-term guidance of 5%-7% organic sales growth might upset some investors. However, this move is acceptable given that the target was laid during the pandemic--when demand for alcohol was exceptionally high--and unrealistic given the current environment, Beckett writes in a note. Additionally, the owner of Johnnie Walker, Guinness and Smirnoff seems to be effectively managing its significant debt, given that the dividend remained unchanged amid concerns of a potential cut, Beckett says. Diageo's 2H performance is likely to be similar if U.S. tariffs are not imposed, he adds. Shares are down 3.3% and nearly 20% over the last 52 weeks.

With volatility set to remain, there may be chances for investors to cash in on market overreactions, especially if Trump's tariff threats are a bluff, the analyst says. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 trades down 0.4%.

The owner of Johnnie Walker, Guinness and Smirnoff reported a positive performance for the first half, ahead of market expectations. Meanwhile, full-year guidance reflects a sequential increase in organic sales growth and a slight decline in organic EBIT, the analysts write in a note. The guidance removal is welcome as it led to unrealistic investor expectations and sub-optimal management decisions designed to support an unfeasible growth aspiration. The target has been replaced by more comprehensive short-term guidance with the promise of improved productivity efforts and tighter capital discipline, they say. Shares are down 2.7% and nearly 20% over the 52-week period.

The London-listed recruitment-and-training group posted earnings before interest and taxes and net cash ahead of expectations, despite market concerns to the contrary, Panmure Liberum says. The company's U.K. recruitment business is gaining market share through deeper penetration of customers and new customers wins, the analysts say. Staffline's Ireland recruitment business is relatively stable, they add. Meanwhile, the PeoplePlus division has suffered delays but still benefits from a strong pipeline, the investment bank adds.

The banks' 4Q loan momentum may also see some pick-up, with data suggesting that overall loans have risen in December from November, he says. Higher confidence around the economy with Singapore's low unemployment rate could have partly contributed to an improvement in lending conditions, Yeap adds. (amanda.lee@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Crest Nicholson reiterating its fire safety remediation actions is reassuring, RBC Capital Markets analyst Anthony Codling says in a note. The year-end remediation charges stand at 249 million pounds, compared with January's guidance range of 245 million pounds to 255 million pounds, he says. The housebuilder's remediation program is expected to be completed during 2029, addressing any lingering concerns regarding its future legacy fire-related liabilities, and giving greater confidence in its valuation and business case, he says. \"While the guidance midpoint is lower than consensus, we welcome the reiteration of fire safety remediation after an audited review, and the news of a strategy update in March,\" Codling says. Shares are down 0.5% at 174.20 pence.(anthony.orunagoriainoff@dowjones.com)</p></span></div>",
