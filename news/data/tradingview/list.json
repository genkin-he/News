You can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as \"may,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"will,\" \"might,\" \"would,\" \"projects,\" \"currently,\" \"intends,\" \"outlook,\" \"forecasts,\" \"targets,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Such forward-looking statements are based on currently available competitive, financial, and economic data and management's views and assumptions regarding future events. Such forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that actual results may differ from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and are subject to risks that could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Certain factors could affect the outcome of the matters described herein. This press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, changes in customer demand for our products and solutions, including demand by the construction markets, the industrial markets, and the metal coatings markets. We could also experience additional increases in labor costs, components and raw materials including zinc and natural gas, which are used in our hot-dip galvanizing process; supply-chain vendor delays; customer requested delays of our products or solutions; delays in additional acquisition opportunities; an increase in our debt leverage and/or interest rates on our debt, of which a significant portion is tied to variable interest rates; availability of experienced management and employees to implement AZZ's growth strategy; a downturn in market conditions in any industry relating to the products we inventory or sell or the solutions that we provide; economic volatility, including a prolonged economic downturn or macroeconomic conditions such as inflation or changes in the political stability in the United States and other foreign markets in which we operate; acts of war or terrorism inside the United States or abroad; and other changes in economic and financial conditions. AZZ has provided additional information regarding risks associated with the business, including in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, in AZZ's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2024, and other filings with the SEC, available for viewing on AZZ's website at www.azz.com and on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. You are urged to consider these factors carefully when evaluating the forward-looking statements herein and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. These statements are based on information as of the date hereof and AZZ assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Financial Measures</p><p class=\"\">Information reconciling forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and Adjusted Diluted Earnings from continuing operations to their respective most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, net income from continuing operations and diluted EPS, is unavailable to AZZ without unreasonable effort because management cannot predict with reasonable certainty all of the necessary components of GAAP net income from continuing operations (such as income taxes, interest expense, unusual or significant gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses, net gains or losses on investments in equity securities and potential future asset impairments). These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on net income from continuing operations and diluted EPS from continuing operations for the relevant periods. We therefore, do not present a guidance range for, or a reconciliation to, the nearest GAAP financial measures of net income from continuing operations or diluted EPS from continuing operations.</p><p class=\"\">Company Contact:</p><p class=\"\">David Nark, Senior Vice President of Marketing, Communications, and Investor Relations</p><p class=\"\">AZZ Inc.</p><p class=\"\">(817) 810-0095</p><p class=\"\">www.azz.com</p><p class=\"\">Investor Contact:</p><p class=\"\">Sandy Martin, Phillip Kupper</p><p class=\"\">Three Part Advisors</p><p class=\"\">(214) 616-2207</p><p class=\"\">www.threepa.com</p><p class=\"\">View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/azz-inc-issues-fiscal-year-2026-guidance-302368608.html</p><p class=\"\">SOURCE AZZ, Inc.</p></span></div>",

The North American market has remained resilient despite a broader slowdown in construction largely driven by sustained government spending on infrastructure, which is expected to continue in the coming years, Douza says. With its relatively low exposure to this market--around 25%--the German property company has opportunities for acquisitions to accelerate its expansion, he says. Shares trade broadly flat at 135.25 euros. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
