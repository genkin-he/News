Inside were, indeed, some amazingthings.</p><p class=\"\">The box was treasure trove of information: not just anyold papers, but historicmining data from Union Pacific Railroad’s extensive work at theCopper Mountain project in the 1970s.</p><p class=\"\">This data revealed potentially much larger thanestimated reserves and a rich history of uranium mining,including:</p><p class=\"\">Rocky Mountain Energy Corporation (“RMEC” – asubsidiary of Union Pacific Railway) planned a large-scale uraniummine with California Edison and estimated resources of between 15.7million pounds – 30.1 million pounds eU3O8 at Copper Mountain forthat mine, with potential for much more</p><p class=\"\">RMEC the resource potential of known deposits andprospects at Copper Mountain to be over 65 million pounds eU3O8</p><p class=\"\">an internal memo for Neutron Energy (now part ofencore) speculated that Copper Mountain has potential of “severalhundred million pounds”</p><p class=\"\">a government program called NURE speculated that theentire Copper Mountain district has 600 million pound potential</p><p class=\"\">evidence of high-grade uranium areas and the potentialfor in-situ recovery (ISR) methods</p><p class=\"\">significant historical production in the 1960s and70s</p><p class=\"\">substantial investment by Union Pacific, who had spentUS$74 million (in today’s dollars) in the 1970s, to developed alarge-scale mine plan with six open pits and a leach pad, ready forproduction</p><p class=\"\">These historical estimates are largely within thecurrent claim boundaries of the “Copper Mountain Project”, inwhich Myriad Uranium  (OTCQB: MYRUF)(FSE: C3Q), holds an earnable 75% interest(50% already earned) — making it potentially one of the largest uranium projects in Wyoming.</p><p class=\"\">Myriad Uranium</p><p class=\"\">With the new discovery, Thomas Lamb, CEO of MyriadUranium, moved quickly to advance the project at CopperMountain.</p><p class=\"\">“We got lucky. And kudos to Rush’s CEO PeteSmith… This data find represents an enormous head-start for Myriadat Copper Mountain, and it’s just the beginning: we expect a greatdeal of additional historical data to be located. Not only do we nowbenefit from tens of millions of dollars in past work by many of theleading uranium geologists at the time, we also see that CopperMountain was worthy of investment in a full-scale mining operation”— Thomas Lamb, CEO, MyriadUranium</p><p class=\"\">Aggressive exploration: Myriad has undertaken a maiden drill campaign at Copper Mountain, which yielded “significant highgrade” results, verifying the historical data while alsoencountering new mineralisation in deeper zones, suggesting a largerresource potential than previously understood.</p><p class=\"\">Expansion of projectarea: guided by the historical data, Myriad hassignificantly expanded the project’s footprint, from around 4,000 acres to over9,320 acres, to encompass areas with high mineralisation potential andto “lock up” mineralised extensions, historical resources, and keytargets.</p><p class=\"\">Data digitisation: Myriad has digitised thehistoric data to build 3D models of the resource, to refineunderstanding of the deposit, as well as acquiring more historicaldrill logs to bring resource estimates up to current standards.</p><p class=\"\">Technical team:Myriad has assembled a strong technical team withexperience in uranium exploration and development. This includesexperts with prior experience at industry leaders like Orano andGlobal Atomic, as well as deep in-situ recovery (ISR)expertise.</p><p class=\"\">Fundraising:Myriad has a very successful year in 2024, bringing in ~$9 million of sophisticated capital.They currently have ~$3m in the bank. The funds are earmarked for anumber of initiatives including project-scale geophysics as they looktowards a larger drill campaign this year.</p><p class=\"\">Domestic uranium supply for USnational security</p><p class=\"\">One of the main drivers of the project’s developmentis to help secure US uraniumsupply. According to the US TreasurySecretary, Scott Bessent, America is in an “energy race” with China as they compete to power the expected demandsof data centers to power artificial intelligence and on-shoring ofmanufacturing. And, with the US as the world’s largest nuclear energyproducer, uranium is an essential piece ofthe US energy puzzle to power the plan to triple the capacity ofAmerica’s nuclear fleet.</p><p class=\"\">(Our analysis on the challenges ofsourcing uranium outside of North America: Where will newuranium supply come from?)</p><p class=\"\">The US government is also actively supporting therevival of domestic uranium production, with initiatives aimed atrepatriating uranium production and the entire fuel cycle back to theUnited States. Domestic US production of U3O8 declined significantly in the 1980s as production incentives and subsidies ended,trade barriers were removed, and uranium prices fell — by 2022,95% of the uraniumpurchased by US nuclear power plantoperators originated in other countries. The US has since announcedplans to revive domestic uranium production and <a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/ban-russian-uranium-aims-revive-american-supply-2024-06-04/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">move the fuel cycle back to theWest</a>. The return of Donald Trump isexpected tocatalyze the development of America’s domestic nuclear and uraniumsector.</p><p class=\"\">Wyoming</p><p class=\"\">The first uranium mines in Wyoming state startedoperating in 1951, and the state has been the leading producer of uranium in the USsince 1995 — and holds the largest knowneconomic uranium ore reserves in the US.</p><p class=\"\">In 2023, the state hosts 4 out of America’s 5operating uranium mines.</p><p class=\"\">This history means the state has the experience andunderstanding to support uranium mining. Now Wyoming’s uraniumindustry is experiencing a resurgence, driven by geopolitics,technology and demand for nuclear energy.</p><p class=\"\">And, Myriad Uranium’s Copper Mountain project islocated in central Wyoming, with good infrastructure links.</p><p class=\"\">Conclusion</p><p class=\"\">The unexpected discovery of historic mining data hasunearthed a potential treasure, not just for Myriad, but for the USand its strategy to achieve “energy dominance” the AI arms race with China.</p><p class=\"\">Now it’s time to dig up the real treasure.</p><p class=\"\">For further information:</p><p class=\"\">Visit Myriad Uranium’s website </p><p class=\"\">Read full story: A chance encounter in Wyoming unearthsa uranium treasure</p><p class=\"\">Disclaimer</p><p class=\"\">The Oregon Group maintains full editorial control overall content published on this website.
