However, the price weakness won't persist, he adds, citing expectations for weak palm oil output. CPO production for Jan. 1-31 is estimated to have fallen 15% on month, according to Malaysia's Southern Peninsular Palm Oil Millers Association. Ng pegs CPO support at 4,250 ringgit/ton and resistance at 4,400 ringgit/ton. The Bursa Malaysia Derivatives contract for April delivery is 43 ringgit lower at 4,324 ringgit/ton.

Uncertainty over U.S. tariffs is likely to keep volatility high in commodity markets, ANZ Research analysts say in a note. Base metals had been under pressure recently due to demand concerns stemming from the impending trade war, they say. However, concerns have eased after Mexican President Sheinbaum says U.S. tariffs on her country's exports will be delayed for a month, they say. Trump has also agreed to delay tariffs on Canada, and focus now turns to China.

Last year, about 11% of the company's total revenues were generated from Canadian Paperboard exports to the U.S., it added. The company also said it sees 2025 Cellulose Specialties average sales prices increasing mid-single-digit percentage from 2024 levels. (stephen.nakrosis@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">2253 GMT - If President Donald Trumps ends up implementing 25% tariff hikes to Canada and Mexico goods, the consumption-related companies that would be impacted the most would be in the produce goods and alcohol spaces, BofA Securities analyst Bryan Spillane tells WSJ. \"This would drive produce prices higher, especially for fruits,\" Spillane says, adding that 40% of the U.S. produce comes from Mexico. Other companies in the grocery space that would get hit by tariffs and higher prices are Mondelez International and WK Kellogg, given that they don't produce essential food and would see their volumes go down, Spillane says. Mondelez makes about half of its Oreos in Mexico, and Kellogg recently closed two U.S. plants and expanded an existing facility in Ontario.

Aeris reported A$26 million in cash at end-December, some A$4 million less than projected by Ord Minnett and despite a lower capital spend. Aeris experienced operational challenges at its Tritton copper mine, with output some 27% below Ord Minnett's forecast and costs around 27% higher. \"The Tritton issues appear to have been somewhat rectified as FY 2025 guidance is unchanged with improved grades/tons set to come from Bugderygar, Avoca Tank and Murrawombie,\" says Ord Minnett, referring to other Aeris-owned pits.

Jefferies, which raises Amcor to buy from hold, points out that Amcor's volume growth has been anemic since it bought Bemis some years ago. \"We estimate cumulative volumes have declined 5%, or 1% per annum since FY 2019, raising concerns around the outlook for plastic packaging and valuation multiple investors are willing to pay,\" analyst Ramoun Lazar says. Amcor recently agreed to buy Berry, which has a similarly weak track record. Amcor expects deal savings to drive growth in new business areas. \"We are not yet convinced (consensus also skeptical) with Jefferies's long-term volume forecasts circa 0-1% per annum,\" Lazar says.

Higher slaughter rates are one factor pressuring hogs, says Terry Reilly of Marex, but what's also hitting hog futures is reports of labor shortages at meat-processing plants, due to fears surrounding ICE raids in several major U.S. cities. Live cattle futures finish down 1.1% to $2.00125 a pound.

For starters, tariffs would drive aluminum prices higher, though the analysts note that Ball could circumvent this cost as it's contractually able to pass it to customers. \"The bigger risk is demand destruction, with consumers already dealing with a significant amount of inflation,\" they write. Ball additionally manufactures beer cans for Constellation Brands in Mexico, as the brewers' Modelo, Corona and Pacifico beers must be made in the country to be considered authentic. Shares of Constellation Brands and Ball fall 2.3% and 0.4%, respectively.

The uncertainty that surrounds tariff plans appears to be driving investors toward gold as a safe-haven asset, with traders speculating that physical metal prices have room to travel higher. \"With supply chain constraints mounting, both gold and silver prices are on the rise, and physical metal premiums could soon follow,\" says Alex Ebkarian of Allegiance Gold. Ebkarian adds that investments and countries are both showing signs of accumulating gold reserves. SPDR Gold is up 0.6%.

The \"fluidity\" of the ongoing negotiations has fund traders looking to cut risk, says the firm, and President Trump's comments on tariffs are not helping. \"Trump's view is that the U.S. and the world must rebalance trade and manufacturing, which will pose the biggest risk to new trade tariff fears,\" says AgResource.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Kasikornbank stands to gain from likely higher fee income and lower cost-to-income ratio, CGS International's Weerapat Wonk-Urai says in a research report, as the brokerage maintains the stock's add rating. The bank recently unveiled 2025 targets such as achieving net fee income growth of mid-to-high single digit versus 6.7% growth in 2024 and attaining cost-to-income ratio at low-to-mid 40s versus 44.1% ratio in 2024. Also, the Thailand bank will focus on growing retail loans that are primarily housing and credit-card loans in the high-income segment, the analyst notes. However, the brokerage trims the stock's target price to THB187.00 from THB188.00 to reflect a lower 2025 book-value forecast. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
