The call begins on February 5, 2025 at 5:00 AM (PT) / 8:00 AM (ET). This press release, including the reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures to their nearest comparable GAAP measures, is also available on that site.</p><p class=\"\">We also provide announcements regarding our financial performance and other matters, including SEC filings, investor events, press and earnings releases, on our investor relations website (https://investor.uber.com/), and our blogs (https://uber.com/blog) and X accounts (@uber and @dkhos), as a means of disclosing material information and complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.</p><p class=\"\">About Uber</p><p class=\"\">Uber's mission is to create opportunity through movement. We started in 2010 to solve a simple problem: how do you get access to a ride at the touch of a button? More than 58 billion trips later, we're building products to get people closer to where they want to be. By changing how people, food, and things move through cities, Uber is a platform that opens up the world to new possibilities.</p><p class=\"\">Forward-Looking Statements</p><p class=\"\">This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business expectations which involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by terms such as \"anticipate, \" \"believe,\" \"contemplate,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"hope,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"might,\" \"objective,\" \"ongoing,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"should,\" \"target,\" \"will,\" or \"would\" or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors relate to, among others: competition, managing our growth and corporate culture, financial performance, investments in new products or offerings, our ability to attract drivers, consumers and other partners to our platform, our brand and reputation and other legal and regulatory developments, particularly with respect to our relationships with drivers and couriers and the impact of the global economy, including rising inflation and interest rates. For additional information on other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted, please see our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and subsequent annual reports, quarterly reports and other filings filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of the date of this press release and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Financial Measures</p><p class=\"\">To supplement our financial information, which is prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA; Free cash flow; Non-GAAP Costs and Operating Expenses as well as, revenue growth rates in constant currency. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.</p><p class=\"\">We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.</p><p class=\"\">There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. In light of these limitations, we provide specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP.</p><p class=\"\">For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the sections titled \"Key Terms for Our Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures,\" \"Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures\" and \"Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures\" included at the end of this release. In regards to forward looking non-GAAP guidance, we are not able to reconcile the forward-looking non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA measure to the closest corresponding GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of certain significant items. These items include, but are not limited to, significant legal settlements, unrealized gains and losses on equity investments, tax and regulatory reserve changes, restructuring costs and acquisition and financing related impacts.</p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"> <br/>                         UBER TECHNOLOGIES, INC. <br/>                  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED

Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding (i) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, (ii) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax, (iii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iv) income (loss) from equity method investments, (v) interest expense, (vi) other income (expense), net, (vii) depreciation and amortization, (viii) stock-based compensation expense, (ix) certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements, (x) goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets, (xi) acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses, (xii) restructuring and related charges and (xiii) other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA margin. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Gross Bookings. We define incremental margin as the change in Adjusted EBITDA between periods divided by the change in Gross Bookings between periods.</p><p class=\"\">Aggregate Driver and Courier Earnings. Aggregate Driver and Courier Earnings refers to fares (net of Uber service fee, taxes and tolls), tips, Driver incentives and Driver benefits.</p><p class=\"\">Driver(s). The term Driver collectively refers to independent providers of ride or delivery services who use our platform to provide Mobility or Delivery services, or both.</p><p class=\"\">Driver or restaurant earnings. Driver or restaurant earnings refer to the net portion of the fare or the net portion of the order value that a Driver or a restaurant retains, respectively. These are generally included in aggregate Drivers and Couriers earnings.</p><p class=\"\">Driver incentives. Driver incentives refer to payments that we make to Drivers, which are separate from and in addition to the Driver's portion of the fare paid by the consumer after we retain our service fee to Drivers. For example, Driver incentives could include payments we make to Drivers should they choose to take advantage of an incentive offer and complete a consecutive number of trips or a cumulative number of trips on the platform over a defined period of time. Driver incentives are recorded as a reduction of revenue or cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. These incentives are generally included in aggregate Drivers and Couriers earnings.</p><p class=\"\">Free cash flow. Free cash flow is a Non-GAAP measure. We define free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures.</p><p class=\"\">Gross Bookings. We define Gross Bookings as the total dollar value, including any applicable taxes, tolls, and fees, of: Mobility rides, Delivery orders (in each case without any adjustment for consumer discounts and refunds, Driver and Merchant earnings, and Driver incentives) and Freight revenue. Gross Bookings do not include tips earned by Drivers. Gross Bookings are an indication of the scale of our current platform, which ultimately impacts revenue.</p><p class=\"\">Monthly Active Platform Consumers (\"MAPCs\"). We define MAPCs as the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility ride or received a Delivery order on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer can use multiple product offerings on our platform in a given month, that unique consumer is counted as only one MAPC.</p><p class=\"\">Revenue Margin. We define Revenue Margin as revenue as a percentage of Gross Bookings.</p><p class=\"\">Segment Adjusted EBITDA. We define each segment's Adjusted EBITDA as segment revenue less direct costs and expenses of that segment as well as any applicable exclusions from Adjusted EBITDA.</p><p class=\"\">Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin. We define each segment's Adjusted EBITDA margin as the segment Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of segment Gross Bookings.</p><p class=\"\">Trips. We define Trips as the number of completed consumer Mobility rides and Delivery orders in a given period. For example, an UberX Share ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three passengers represents one Trip. We believe that Trips are a useful metric to measure the scale and usage of our platform.</p><p class=\"\">Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures</p><p class=\"\">We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business and assess our performance. In addition to revenue, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use: Adjusted EBITDA; Free cash flow; Non-GAAP Costs and Operating Expenses; as well as, revenue growth rates in constant currency, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures because they are key measures used by our management to evaluate our operating performance. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. Our calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA</p><p class=\"\">We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding (i) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, (ii) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax, (iii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iv) income (loss) from equity method investments, (v) interest expense, (vi) other income (expense), net, (vii) depreciation and amortization, (viii) stock-based compensation expense, (ix) certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements, (x) goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets, (xi) acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses, (xii) restructuring and related charges and (xiii) other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance.</p><p class=\"\">We have included Adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain non-cash expenses and certain variable charges.</p><p class=\"\">Legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements</p><p class=\"\">Legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements are primarily related to certain significant legal proceedings or governmental investigations related to worker classification definitions, or tax agencies challenging our non-income tax positions. These matters have limited precedent, cover extended historical periods and are unpredictable in both magnitude and timing, therefore are distinct from normal, recurring legal, tax and regulatory matters and related expenses incurred in our ongoing operating performance.</p><p class=\"\">Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the following:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as   depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible   assets, and although these are non-cash charges, the assets being   depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and   Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash capital expenditure   requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure   requirements;     </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has   been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant   recurring expense in our business and an important part of our   compensation strategy;     </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain restructuring and related charges,   part of which may be settled in cash;     </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBITDA excludes other items not indicative of our ongoing   operating performance;     </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect period to period changes in taxes,   income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;     </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the components of other income   (expense), net, which primarily includes: interest income; foreign   currency exchange gains (losses), net; and unrealized gain (loss) on debt   and equity securities, net; and     </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve   changes and settlements that may reduce cash available to us.   </li></ul><p class=\"\">Constant Currency</p><p class=\"\">We compare the percent change in our current period results from the corresponding prior period using constant currency disclosure. We present constant currency growth rate information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying revenue performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We calculate constant currency by translating our current period financial results using the corresponding prior period's monthly exchange rates for our transacted currencies other than the U.S. dollar.</p><p class=\"\">Free Cash Flow</p><p class=\"\">We define free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures.</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Costs and Operating Expenses</p><p class=\"\">Costs and operating expenses are defined as: cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization; operations and support; sales and marketing; research and development; and general and administrative expenses. We define Non-GAAP costs and operating expenses as costs and operating expenses excluding: (i) stock-based compensation expense, (ii) certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements, (iii) goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets, (iv) acquisition, financing and divestiture related expenses, (v) restructuring and related charges and (vi) other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance.</p><p class=\"\">Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA</p><p class=\"\">The following table presents reconciliations of

Investor access to bitcoin jumped last month after the U.S. approved the introduction of an exchange traded fund that tracks the cryptocurrency's price, he says. \"Further improvements to investor access have begun under the Trump administration.\" Bitcoin volatility could fall gradually once the ETF market matures and as the financial-market infrastructure supporting the bitcoin market improves. Standard Chartered expects bitcoin to rise to $200,000 by end-2025, to $300,000 by end-2026, $400,000 by end-2027 and $500,000 by end-2028. It last trades up 1.6% at $98,241, according to LSEG. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1126 GMT - The dollar falls to a one-week low and has scope to extend these losses slightly on hopes the U.S. and China will reach a trade deal, ING analyst Francesco Pesole says in a note. China's relatively measured response to U.S. President Trump's 10% levy on Chinese imports has raised hopes for a deal, he says. Markets are optimistic that a deal can be struck before China's retaliatory tariffs kick in on Feb. 10. However, a sustained dollar fall looks unlikely amid continued uncertainties. \"A consensus U.S.-China deal does seem the most likely scenario, but we sense markets are underpricing the risk of a more prolonged trade spat.\" The DXY dollar index falls 0.5% to a low of 107.373. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1019 GMT - Bitcoin rises slightly but trades below the key $100,000 level amid uncertainty over President Trump's tariff plans. China's plans for retaliatory tariffs after Trump imposed a new 10% levy on Chinese imports add uncertainty to risky assets including cryptocurrencies, Saxo Bank analysts say in a note. Market sentiment is also muted after the Trump administration discussed the potential inclusion of bitcoin in a newly proposed U.S. sovereign wealth fund, sparking speculation over institutional adoption, they say. \"Traders remain focused on regulatory developments and macroeconomic shifts.\" Bitcoin rises 1.1% to $97,523, according to LSEG. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1013 GMT - Rampant U.S. Treasury issuance is pushing up borrowing costs and keep policy rates higher, Jupiter Asset Management's portfolio managers say in a note. \"This could widen the difference in the yield of U.S. Treasurys versus the rest of the world, attracting further capital flows and strengthening the dollar,\" they say. Inevitably, a sustained strength in dollar forces overseas investors to sell dollar-based assets, tightening financial conditions and this typically triggers the Federal Reserve to ease its policy, they say. \"One should look at the U.S. current account deficit for clues on the Fed's policy path.\" The 10-year U.S. Treasury-German Bund yield spread is 212 basis points, up 1 basis point, according to Tradeweb.(emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0943 GMT - The U.K. Debt Management Office auction of the July 2053 green gilt at 1000 GMT is expected to perform well in relative value terms, RBC Capital Markets analysts say in a note. Wednesday's tap is likely to be the final one for the green gilt, which should support demand for the bond, the analysts say. \"We have also observed that outgoing 30-year conventional gilts have consistently outperformed into the end of their tapping cycles,\" RBC says. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0919 GMT - Uncertainties remain around U.S. trade tariffs but easing tensions could improve risk appetite, driving U.S. Treasury yields higher, says Christopher Tahir at Exness. \"Uncertainties about further trade developments could leave investors cautious while new decisions from China and the U.S. could fuel volatility,\" the senior market strategist says in a note. \"Should trade tensions ease, risk appetite could improve, leading to a rebound in yields if traders move out of Treasury bonds.\" The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield falls 3 basis points to 4.480%, according to LSEG data. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0912 GMT - The U.K. FTSE 100 index could rise to a new all-time high if the Bank of England signals additional future interest-rate cuts during Thursday's rate decision, Capital.com's Daniela Sabin Hathorn says in a note. \"A BOE rate cut could renew investor interest in U.K. stocks,\" she says. The FTSE 100 reached a new high of 8692.84 on Jan. 31. Any hints of more interest-rate cuts could reignite a U.K. equities rally, Hathorn says. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0909 GMT - Bank Indonesia may cut rates by 25 bps in 1Q, bringing its policy rate to 5.50%, likely at its February policy meeting, as it prioritizes postpandemic easing, Barclays economist Brian Tan says in a note. Despite stable 4Q GDP growth, policymakers are expected to remain focused on reversing previous rate hikes, he notes. With USD/IDR stable around 16,300, another cut is likely, he reckons. Inflation softened in January, prompting a downward revision to Tan's 2025 average inflation forecast to 1.4% from 1.7%, below BI's 1.5%-3.5% target. If electricity discounts are extended beyond February, inflation could fall further, strengthening the case for continued monetary easing, he adds.

The central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged. This means the decision will be a \"non-event\" with the focus on any signals about future policy, ING analyst Frantisek Taborsky says in a note. The policy statement Wednesday and NBP Governor Adam Glapinski's press conference Thursday could both sound hawkish again by indicating rates will remain restrictive, Taborsky says. \"However, it's hard to imagine at this point what more the governor might add to the hawkish message from January.\" The NBP's decision is expected at 1400 GMT.

Retail sales contracted 2.9% on year in December, marking its worst performance since February 2022, she writes. But with the Singapore Tourism Board expecting 17 million-18.5 million visitors this year that could generate S$29 billion to S$30.5 billion in revenue, things look brighter for the retail sector. Domestic consumption is also expected to be supported by a resilient labor market, Ling says. However, she cautions that external headwinds pose as a key risk for the retail sector, and a challenging trade environment may dampen near-term market sentiment. OCBC expects Singapore's retail sales to expand around 2% in 2025 compared to 2024's 1.2% and 2023's 2.3%.(amanda.lee@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0837 GMT - The Canadian dollar rises to a two-week high against the U.S. dollar as it continues to recover after President Trump agreed to pause a 25% tariff on Canada, ING's Francesco Pesole says in a note. The Canadian dollar could rise further if tariff risks are entirely priced out, he says. There is a residual 1% risk premium embedded into USD/CAD. \"That said, we are not sure markets will or should move to a completely optimistic stance on the U.S.-Canada trade spat.\" There are no clear hints Canada will be spared from another round of potential universal tariffs. USD/CAD could fall to 1.42 in the short-term but risks remain skewed to 1.45 this summer. USD/CAD falls to a low of 1.4289.

The fourth quarter GAAP diluted EPS was $4.36, slightly up from $4.18 in the previous year, while the adjusted EPS was $2.13, down from $3.70.</p><p class=\"\">Net income attributable to Bunge for the full year was $1.137 billion, a sharp decline from $2.243 billion in 2023. The company's core segment EBIT also saw a decrease, with $2.171 billion reported for 2024 compared to $3.717 billion in the previous year.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Business and Operational Highlights</strong></p> <p class=\"\">In the Agribusiness segment, Bunge experienced lower processing results, partially offset by higher merchandising. The Refined and Specialty Oils segment saw lower results primarily driven by North America. The company made substantial progress on growth investments and strategic partnerships, as well as the divestiture of its sugar &amp; bioenergy joint venture.</p><p class=\"\">During the fourth quarter, Bunge repurchased $500 million of shares, bringing the year-to-date total to $1.1 billion.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Bunge is in the late stages of regulatory processes for its announced combination with Viterra and CJ Selecta. The company has also achieved its 100% traceability and monitoring targets in Brazil, marking a significant step in its sustainability efforts.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Management's Perspective</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Greg Heckman, Bunge’s Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our team closed out a year of significant achievements for Bunge. We made great progress on integration planning for our announced combination with Viterra and, having received the vast majority of regulatory approvals, we expect to close the transaction soon. We continued to make productivity improvements from our investments in the business while returning significant capital to shareholders. And we took meaningful steps in sustainability by achieving our 100% traceability and monitoring targets in Brazil.\"</p><p class=\"\">Heckman also noted the challenges faced due to increased geopolitical uncertainty but expressed confidence in the company's ability to continue creating value for all stakeholders.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Future Outlook</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Looking ahead to 2025, Bunge forecasts a full-year adjusted EPS of approximately $7.75, excluding announced acquisitions expected to close during the year. The company anticipates lower results in the Agribusiness segment, particularly in Processing, while Merchandising results are expected to be slightly down. Refined and Specialty Oils results are projected to decline due to a more balanced supply and demand environment in North America. However, Milling and Corporate and Other segments are expected to see improved results.</p><p class=\"\">Bunge also expects an adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 25%, net interest expense between $250 to $280 million, capital expenditures of $1.5 to $1.7 billion, and depreciation and amortization of approximately $490 million.</p><p class=\"\">SEC Filing: <a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1996862/000199686225000006/bg-20250205.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Bunge Global SA [ BG ] - 8-K - Feb. 05, 2025</a></p></span></div>",
