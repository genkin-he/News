Kesko’s comparable operating profit is estimated to improve in 2025. Kesko estimates that its comparable operating profit in 2025 will amount to €640-740 million. The profit guidance is based on an estimate of a gradually improving economic cycle in all Kesko operating countries. Key uncertainties impacting Kesko’s outlook are developments in consumer confidence, investment appetites, as well as geopolitical crises and tensions.  </p><p class=\"\">In grocery trade, B2C trade and the foodservice market are estimated to remain stable.  In 2025, the comparable operating margin for the grocery trade division is estimated to stay clearly above 6% despite the investments in price and the store site network in accordance with Kesko’s strategy for 2024-2026.</p><p class=\"\">In building and technical trade, the cycle is expected to improve in 2025 from the historically low levels. Profitability in the building and technical trade division is estimated to improve on 2024.</p><p class=\"\">In car trade, the market for new cars is expected to stay at a low level. Demand for used cars and services is estimated to remain good. Profitability for the car trade division is estimated to remain at a good level in 2025 despite weak demand for new cars.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">President and CEO Jorma Rauhala:</strong></p><p class=\"\">Kesko’s sales and profitability were at a good level in 2024 despite the challenges in our operating environment.  Towards the end of the year, we witnessed a turnaround, as our quarterly result improved for the first time in eight quarters in Q4. Full-year net sales totalled €11,920.1 million, while our comparable operating profit amounted to €650.1 million. The successful execution of our updated growth strategy in all three divisions has yielded results also in a challenging operating environment. Our cash flow from operating activities amounted to €1,008.2 million. We have also been successful in managing costs. Kesko’s good ability to generate profits and our strong financial position enable investments in growth as well as good dividend capacity. Kesko’s Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting a dividend of €0.90 per share – in total, €358 million – to be paid in four instalments.</p><p class=\"\">In the grocery trade division, sales grew in 2024 in both our grocery stores and the foodservice business. Net sales for the division totalled €6,381.4 million, up by 0.5%. The comparable operating profit for the division was €438.0 million. Kespro performed particularly well in 2024, and we aim to continue the good performance in the foodservice business. The popularity of online grocery persisted, and sales grew by 13.5% thanks to express deliveries. Campaigns and other marketing measures strengthened our customer flows and sales during the year, but the market share for our grocery stores came down as average purchase decreased. Price competition in Finnish grocery trade remained tight, and price continues to be a significant factor for grocery customers. At the beginning of 2025, we responded to customer wishes by launching an extensive price programme, reducing prices of more than 1,200 grocery products. The investment in this strategic programme amounts to nearly €50 million, shared between Kesko and the retailers. Our focus in grocery trade is to strengthen our market position while maintaining good profitability.</p><p class=\"\">In building and technical trade, profitability remained good even though it declined year-on-year due to weak construction activity. Net sales for the division totalled €4,351.6 million, up by 3.8% thanks to the Davidsen acquisition in Denmark. The division’s comparable operating profit totalled €169.1 million. In 2024, demand decreased in both building and home improvement trade and technical trade in all our operating countries as construction volumes came down, but sales picked up in the latter half of the year. In the longer term, the outlook for building and technical trade is positive. Urbanisation, renovation and infrastructure investment debt, infrastructure projects, and the green transition underpin construction over cycles. During the year, we expanded operations to Denmark by completing the acquisition of Davidsen Koncernen A/S, one of the leading operators in Danish building and home improvement trade, at the beginning of February. In August, we announced the acquisitions of three other Danish operators: Roslev, Tømmergaarden and CF Petersen &amp; Søn. Strategic focus areas for the division are securing profitability and improving cash flow with a country and business focus.</p><p class=\"\">The car trade market in Finland was weak in 2024, but profitability for Kesko’s car trade division stayed at a good level. The market showed some signs of picking up, but weak consumer confidence, continued high interest rates, and uncertainty regarding powertrain alternatives slowed down recovery. Development in the used car market was clearly better than in new cars, and sales also grew in car related services. Net sales for the division in 2024 totalled €1,209.4 million, representing a decrease of 4.0% in comparable terms. The division’s comparable operating profit totalled €69.3 million. The major transformation measures carried out within the division in recent years have improved its profitability. Kesko’s strategic focus is on outperforming the market in all car trade business areas, namely new cars, used cars, and services.</p><p class=\"\">I took over as Kesko’s President and CEO at the beginning of February 2024. In June, we updated Kesko’s strategy, keeping the main pillars intact. In all business operations, we seek sales growth, better customer experiences, profitability and efficiency with the help of e.g. digital services and artificial intelligence. All three divisions have plenty of potential for growth and for further strengthening their business especially by listening to their customers and responding to customer needs. I see Kesko’s future bright also in upcoming years. I want to thank all our customers, the people of K Group, our shareholders, and our partners for their trust and good collaboration over the past year.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Proposal for profit distribution</strong></p><p class=\"\">The Board of Directors of Kesko Corporation proposes to the Annual General Meeting to be held on 24 March 2025 that a dividend of €0.90 per share be paid for the year 2024 based on the adopted balance sheet on shares held outside the company at the date of dividend distribution.

The first acquisition of significant character was signed, sales grew by 31%, and operating profit by 52%. After the end of the quarter, financing for the acquisition has been secured, and closing of the deal was performed on 31<strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">st</strong> <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">January. The ambitions for the coming</strong> <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">four year</strong> <!-- -->period are being refined and will be presented on Friday, March 7, at EQL's first ever capital markets day. Sales growth for the full year 2024/25 is forecasted to be around 40%.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Financial Overview for the third Quarter</strong></p><p class=\"\">During the quarter, sales rose to 92.2 MSEK, an increase of 31% from 70.2 MSEK the previous year. Operating profit (EBIT) increased by 52% to 14.8 MSEK compared to 9.8 MSEK the previous year, with an EBITDA margin of 19%. The operating margin was negatively affected by continued transport disruptions in the Red Sea, which pressured the gross margin to 41% (48%).</p><p class=\"\">There was no significant sale of Covid-19 tests during the quarter, this means that the entire growth was driven by increased pharmaceutical sales.</p><p class=\"\">Liquid assets amounted to 15.6 (10.4) MSEK at the end of the quarter. In addition, there is an unused working capital credit of 10.5 (9.6) MSEK.</p><p class=\"\">Financial Objectives and Projections for the Fiscal Year</p><p class=\"\">For the full year 2024/25, we project sales growth of around 40%. Achieving this would be in line with our long-term sales goals as stated in our five-year plan. In addition to the sales target, our goal is to achieve an EBITDA margin of at least 25% during the last quarter of 2024/25.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Product Launches and Market Dynamics</strong></p><p class=\"\">An asset acquisition consisting of four niche originals was signed during the quarter. The products are Buronil, Folimet, Hydromed, and Marplan. These are typical EQL products with stable sales that have been on the market for a long time. The portfolio is expected to add approximately 51 MSEK in sales and 28 MSEK in EBITDA, with a gross margin of 71%, on annual basis. The acquisition also provides access to new markets and the opportunity for certain optimizations by consolidating manufacturing and launch in new markets. After the end of the quarter, financing was secured via a bond, which was heavily oversubscribed. The bond interest rate, which was 3M STIBOR + 4.0%, combined with the great interest in the bond, is seen as a vote of confidence in investors' view of EQL's business model and development opportunities.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Other</strong></p><p class=\"\">With a new President in the USA and cautious signals that the situation in the Middle East is de-escalating, we hope that the de facto blockade of the Suez Canal will end in 2025. We are closely monitoring developments, and when the situation is deemed safe, our transporters will start using the Suez Canal again. This would, in turn, lead to lower transport costs and thus strengthened gross margins, with a certain time lag, as a large part of the current inventory has been transported at a higher cost.</p><p class=\"\">Furthermore, we will present our new strategic plan at a capital markets day on March 7. This will be the first time EQL Pharma calls for a capital markets day. The idea is to communicate the new financial goals and explain how these will be achieved, as well as the opportunities and risks we see. We will also go through our operations in a more detail than we can do in the usual quarterly presentations. We hope that as many as possible will participate, either on-site, at Carnegie in Stockholm, or via live video link.</p><p class=\"\">This disclosure contains information that EQL Pharma is obliged to make public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation (EU nr 596/2014) and the Swedish Securities Markets Act (2007:528).

Alma Media’s Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of EUR 0.46 per share be paid for the financial year 2024 (2023: EUR 0.45 per share). The dividend will be paid to shareholders who are registered in Alma Media Corporation’s shareholder register maintained by Euroclear Finland Ltd on the record date of the payment, 14 April 2025. The Board of Directors proposes that the dividend be paid on 23 April 2025. Based on the number of outstanding shares on the closing date, 31 December 2024, the dividend payment totals EUR 37,786,811 (36,932,982).</p><p class=\"\">Alma Media publishes notice to the Annual General Meeting of 5 March 2025, Financial Statements and Dividend Proposal will be published on 20 March 2025.</p><p class=\"\">No essential changes have taken place after the end of the financial year with respect to the company’s financial standing. The proposed distribution of profit does not, in the view of the Board of Directors, compromise the company’s liquidity.</p><p class=\"\">CEO’s review: Improved efficiency in a subdued operating environment</p><p class=\"\">Alma Media’s business developed favourably in the fourth quarter. Revenue grew by 4.1% to MEUR 81.2. Revenue was supported by acquisitions, but the weakened Czech koruna dampened revenue performance. The Group’s advertising sales decreased by 8.4%.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted operating profit grew substantially, by 16.6%, reaching MEUR 19.5, or 24.0% of revenue. The share of digital business was 83.6% of revenue. We continued to invest in the development of our services, particularly in the Career and Marketplaces segments. Profitability for the full year came to 24.6%, approaching our long-term target of 25%.</p><p class=\"\">There are positive signals in the market and national economies are expected to pick up, but fluctuations in the global economy may still affect market development. Inflation has decreased from its peak and the lowering of the key interest rates initiated by the ECB has helped strengthen consumer confidence in their finances and promote households’ opportunities to make purchases of durable consumer goods, such as homes and cars.</p><p class=\"\">We accelerated our investments in product development</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">In the Alma Career</strong> segment, revenue decreased by 2.5% and amounted to MEUR 26.3. Adjusted operating profit increased by 6.4% to MEUR 10.6 and represented 40.4% of revenue. In local currencies, revenue decreased by 1.0% and adjusted operating profit increased by 6.8%. In Q4, the development of invoicing in local currencies was on a par with the comparison period. The development costs associated with the segment's common platform had a negative effect on profitability.</p><p class=\"\">There were again significant differences in the labour market cycle between the segment's operating countries. Among the significant operating countries, the employment situation remained good in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which maintained stable demand for labour. Recruitment activity increased particularly among small and medium-sized employers, but some of the larger customer companies continued to postpone recruitment. The Croatian labour market also performed well during the year, as the unemployment rate fell below 5% for the first time. In the Baltic countries and Finland, however, the situation still did not improve.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">In the Alma Marketplaces</strong> segment, revenue increased by 18.1% to MEUR 25.9 in Q4, supported by the acquisition of Netwheels. Adjusted operating profit increased by 23.5% to MEUR 6.9 and was 26.6% of revenue. Organic revenue growth was 5.6%. Expenses increased by 16.2% as a result of acquisitions. In spite of the weak market conditions, we continued to implement our development projects, particularly in digital services related to the automotive and housing verticals, focusing on the development of transactional business. Revenue from the Mobility business area increased by 52.7% to MEUR 9.0. Excluding the effect of acquisitions and divestments, revenue increased by 6.1%. There were further signals of a recovery in the housing market, especially with regard to old dwellings. Revenue from the Real Estate business area increased by 7.8% and amounted to MEUR 9.4.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">The Alma News Media</strong> segment’s revenue remained on a par with the comparison period, but active cost management meant that the segment's adjusted expenses decreased by 2.4% and adjusted operating profit improved by 13.3%, reaching 17.5% of revenue. This is a high level for the media business by international comparison.</p><p class=\"\">Change negotiations were conducted to ensure longterm competitiveness. As a result, the publication of Kauppalehti’s print supplements Optio and Fakta was discontinued, as was the publication of Mediuutiset. The number of employees was reduced by 20 person-years.</p><p class=\"\">The economic conditions were not easy for the Finnish media industry, although interest in the news remained at a high level. Advertising revenue decreased by 2.8%. The share of revenue from digital business rose to 61.5% and the digital revenue grew by 14.1% The number of digital subscriptions is now 207,000.</p><p class=\"\">AI is developing quickly – and so are we</p><p class=\"\">Our strategy is focused on the development, growth and scaling up of business with the help of the latest AI technology. We want to improve our agility and accelerate product and service development and the introduction of new products to the market. We respond the changing needs of our customers and partners by making the necessary investments in expertise and technology to produce solutions that utilise AI and improve processes in our customers’ value chains. We have the level of preparedness, capabilities and motivation required for continuous renewal.</p><p class=\"\">Alma has dozens of AI-related projects under way to improve productivity and efficiency in our existing processes, complement our existing services with AI-driven components, and ultimately introduce completely new AI-based business concepts to the market.</p><p class=\"\">Kai Telanne</p><p class=\"\">President and CEO</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Operating environment</strong></p><p class=\"\">The European Commission (EC) published its latest economic forecast on 15 November 2024, estimating that the rate of economic growth in the EU was 0.9% in 2024, and that inflation had slowed to 2.6%. The year 2024 marked the return of falling interest rates. This was particularly due to the weaker economic situation in Europe and reduced inflation, which made it possible for the ECB to start its interest rate cuts.</p><p class=\"\">For 2025, the EC expects growth of 1.5% for the EU economy, and inflation is projected to decrease to 2.4%. The EC estimates that the unemployment rate in the EU will be 5.9%, representing a decrease from the level of 6.1% seen in 2024. The markets expect the ECB to continue its interest rate cuts this year. At the same time, risks related to global trade policy and geopolitics have grown, and the expectations are subject to increased uncertainty, which may be reflected in economic development.</p><p class=\"\">In Alma Media’s main operating countries, expectations for economic development in 2025 are primarily positive. The Finnish economy has cautious outlook, which is expected to see a gradual pick-up, with the EC projecting growth of 1.5%, inflation of 2.0% and an unemployment rate of 7.9% this year. It is expected that the price of financing will gradually fall, and this will support household spending on durable consumer goods and the willingness of companies to invest. Housing construction is expected to recover slowly.</p><p class=\"\">In addition to Finland, Alma Media’s main markets are the Czech Republic and Slovakia in Eastern Central Europe, and Croatia in Southern Europe. The EC projects that GDP growth will accelerate from 1.0% in 2024 to 2.4% this year in the Czech Republic and from 2.2% to 2.3% in Slovakia, whereas for Croatia, it predicts growth to slow from 3.6% to 3.3%. The EC's unemployment rate projections for this year are 2.7% for the Czech Republic, 5.3% for Slovakia and 4.7% for Croatia. Alma’s main operating countries are dependent on foreign trade, and the increased uncertainty in global politics casts a shadow over the positive drivers.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Outlook for 2025</strong></p><p class=\"\">Alma Media expects its full-year revenue and adjusted operating profit of 2025 to remain at the 2024 level. The full-year revenue for 2024 was MEUR 312.7 and the adjusted operating profit was MEUR 76.9.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Background for the outlook</strong></p><p class=\"\">The outlook is based on the assessment that the national economies in the company's main markets will pick up, but uncertainty in the markets will continue. Fluctuations in the global economy may affect the development of the markets.</p><p class=\"\">The period of slow growth in Finland is expected to continue, and advertising is still subject to uncertainty. Acquisitions will increase the company’s revenue and operating profit. The diversification of the Group’s business activities between multiple geographical markets and business areas, and purposeful cost control, stabilise the company’s outlook even in challenging market conditions.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Market situation in the main markets in Finland</strong></p><p class=\"\">Market development in the automotive industry</p><p class=\"\">According to statistics provided by the Finnish Information Centre of the Automobile Sector, first registrations of new passenger cars in Finland decreased in by 15.4% year-on-year in 2024. Sales of used cars by car dealerships increased by approximately 5%.</p><p class=\"\">Market development in housing</p><p class=\"\">According to the Central Federation of Finnish Real Estate Agencies, the number of housing transactions for old dwellings in 2024 was 50,388, which represents a decrease of 1.5% when compared to the previous year. In Q4, the sales volume of old dwellings (15,698 units) was on a par with the corresponding period in the previous year, and 11.2% lower than the five-year average. The sales volume of new dwellings (770 units) decreased by 4.1% year-on-year and was 69.1% lower than the five-year average. The total sales volume (16,468 units) decreased by 0.4% year-on-year and was 18.3% lower than the five-year average.</p><p class=\"\">Market development in the media business</p><p class=\"\">According to Kantar TNS, a total of MEUR 1,302 was spent on media advertising in 2024, a 1.3% reduction from year before. On top of the 25% (MEUR 188 million) share of retail trade, the major industries in media advertising, were food (MEUR 79) and cars (MEUR 63). When excluded social media and search advertising from the total, media advertising dipped by 3.3%. Among the industries, advertising in cosmetics, telecommunications and food increased the most and advertising in construction, cosmetics, motor vehicles and telecommunications fell the most. Job vacancy advertisements softened by 30.9% in December.</p><p class=\"\">More information:</p><p class=\"\">Kai Telanne, President and CEO, tel. +358 (0)10 665 3500</p><p class=\"\">Taru Lehtinen, CFO, tel. +358 (0)10 665 3609</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">News conference and live webcast</strong></p><p class=\"\">Alma Media Corporation will publish the Financial Statement Bulletin for January 1–December 31, 2024, accounting period on Wednesday, 5 February 2025 approximately at 8.00 EET.</p><p class=\"\">A combined analyst, investor and media conference and webcast will be held in English by President &amp; CEO Kai Telanne and CFO Taru Lehtinen at 11.00–12.00.</p><p class=\"\">The conference will be arranged in the Alma House (address: Alvar Aallon katu 3 C, Helsinki).

This enabled us to achieve significant cost savings, deliver strong cash flow, and implement a comprehensive product launch program for the 2025 season.</p><p class=\"\">Challenging market conditions in the fourth quarter</p><p class=\"\">The year’s challenging market situation continued into the fourth quarter, with subsequently lower consumer demand. The Group’s sales declined organically by 3% and the operating income, excluding items affecting comparability, amounted to SEK -694m (-168) for the fourth quarter.</p><p class=\"\">In the Husqvarna Forest &amp; Garden Division, organic growth was unchanged for the quarter, with growth in handheld and wheeled products, as well as in parts and accessories. Sales in the Gardena Division decreased, with growth for hand tools, while sales of watering products declined. In the Husqvarna Construction Division, sales declined in North America due to a continuation of the challenging market situation, however, our sales increased in Europe.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Strong cash flow and reduced net debt</strong></p><p class=\"\">For the full year 2024, operating income, excluding items affecting comparability, amounted to SEK 3.2bn (5.0). The decrease was due to lower sales volumes with higher promotional activities and a negative product mix. This was partly offset by good results from savings programs, which generated SEK 735m. Direct operating cash flow increased to SEK 6.9bn (6.5), driven by substantial inventory reductions. We have reduced net debt by SEK 1.2bn compared to last year. The Board will propose to the Annual General Meeting a dividend of SEK 1.00 (3.00) for the year, in line with our dividend policy, representing 32% of earnings per share excluding items affecting comparability, or 43% of earnings per share.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Improving results in North America</strong></p><p class=\"\">In recent years, the Husqvarna Forest &amp; Garden Division has taken decisive actions to improve results in North America. Low-margin business has been discontinued and the production structure has been consolidated. We are now entering the next step where we divest our manufacturing facility in Orangeburg, SC, to Flex Ltd. In parallel, we have entered a long-term supplier agreement with Flex, to ensure continued production of the division’s wheeled products and assembly of handheld products in the US. This is a partnership that will build profitability, improve capital efficiency, enhance production flexibility and strengthen our competitiveness in North America. Related cost savings are expected to amount to SEK 350m by 2030 (see page 9).</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Our strategic transformation continues</strong></p><p class=\"\">Our long-term transformation is about delivering value to customers, shareholders and employees through growth in the focus areas; robotic mowers, battery-powered products, watering and solutions for the professional market. Since 2021 we measure our progress through operational ambitions, including share of electrification, number of connected devices, and sales of robotic mowers. During the year, the share of electrified products reached 44% (42) of our sales of motorized products. Connected devices grew to 4.9 million (4.5). For robotic mowers, net sales amounted to SEK 7.2bn (8.1). We strengthened our position and grew in the professional robotics market. However, sales in the residential segment declined due to increased competition in the low-value segments, as well as restrained consumer spending, particularly for the high value segments. For the 2025 season, we have significantly expanded our range with new boundary wire-free robotic mowers.</p><p class=\"\">As the current strategic period for the Group approaches its end, our focus remains firm – we are continuing to prioritize areas with profitable growth potential, and we will present an update of our strategy at a Capital Markets Day in the fourth quarter of 2025.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">We deliver on our sustainability targets</strong></p><p class=\"\">Our ambition to electrify the product range is the main enabler to consistently reduce our carbon footprint. To date, we have reduced CO₂ emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) by -56% compared with the base year of 2015. With that, we have exceeded our target of a -35% reduction by 2025.

A continued strongdevelopment of the savings business contributed to net fee and commissionincomereaching its highest ever level during the year. In order to strengthen Bank'sefficiency and competitiveness, efforts have been made since the start of theyear to identify potential efficiency improvements, mainly within central andbusiness support units, and to then implement these. The Bank's total staffing(i.e. the number of employees plus external resources) decreased by a netamountof 778 people, or 6%, from the first quarter, despite increased staffing inthebranch operations as a response to increasing customer activity.

Increased customer activity and demand to physically meet the Banklocally, led to the Bank expanding the availability of advisory meetings andother services at some 20 new locations across Sweden during the year.
