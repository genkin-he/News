We must not make assumptions, and Canada must not let its guard down.</p><p class=\"\">“These tariffs are not just an attack on Canada—they are an attack on all workers, both Canadian and American. They threaten our shared prosperity and inflict profound hardship on working families in both countries.</p><p class=\"\">“When the tariff threat eventually resurfaces, Canada will have to be ready with robust support measures for workers, and direct emergency programs for impacted sectors. Teamsters Canada will support a strong response, including ‘Buy Canadian’ campaigns.</p><p class=\"\">“Donald Trump has said that Canada is a ‘very tough’ country, and that the U.S. does not need Canada. Canada must now urgently work to develop new markets and diversify our exports. We have options! We are a reliable, trustworthy, and lucrative trading partner with much to offer the world. Expanding energy corridors, pipelines, and transportation infrastructure will be critical to ensuring Canadian goods and commodities reach new markets.</p><p class=\"\">“Clearly, this was never about fentanyl trafficking or illegal migrants from the north. Canada has been disrespected, threatened with annexation, and seen decades of friendship and alliance trampled.

The increase in net interest income was due mainly to lower interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds. The net interest margin increased to 3.51% during the fourth quarter from 3.30% during the prior quarter. Compared to the previous quarter, interest income on loans increased $22,000 to $16.0 million due to higher average balances but partially offset by lower yields on loans. Average loan balances increased $24.5 million while the average tax-equivalent yield on the loan portfolio decreased 15 basis points to 6.28%. Interest on investment securities declined slightly due to lower balances while partially offset by higher earning rates. Compared to the third quarter 2024, interest on deposits decreased $480,000, or 8.2% mainly due to lower rates, while interest on other borrowed funds declined by $363,000, due to lower rates and balances. The average rate on interest-bearing deposits decreased 23 basis points to 2.25% while the average rate on other borrowed funds decreased 51 basis points to 5.10% in the fourth quarter.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Non-Interest Income</strong></p><p class=\"\">Non-interest income totaled $3.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease of $882,000 from the previous quarter. The decrease in non-interest income during the fourth quarter of 2024 was primarily due to a $1.0 million loss on the sales of lower yielding investment securities mentioned above, while the third quarter of 2024 did not include any sales of investment securities. Additionally, lower sales of residential mortgages this quarter resulted in a decline of $182,000 in gains on sales of these mortgages. The decline in other non-interest income of $221,000 this quarter compared to the prior quarter resulted from sales of premises, equipment and foreclosed assets that did not re-occur in the current quarter. Partially offsetting those declines was an increase of $722,000 in bank owned life insurance income.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Non-Interest Expense</strong></p><p class=\"\">During the fourth quarter of 2024, non-interest expense totaled $11.9 million, an increase of $1.3 million compared to the prior quarter. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to increases of $470,000 in professional fees and $461,000 in compensation and benefits. The increase in professional fees this quarter was primarily due to higher consulting costs on several initiatives. The increase in compensation and benefits was attributable to an increase in employees and higher incentive compensation costs.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Income Tax Expense (Benefit)</strong></p><p class=\"\">Landmark recorded an income tax benefit of $886,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to income tax expense of $867,000 in the prior quarter. The effective tax rate was (37.0%) in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to 18.1% in the third quarter of 2024. The fourth quarter of 2024 included the recognition of $1.0 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits, which reduced the effective tax rate.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Balance Sheet Highlights</strong></p><p class=\"\">As of December 31, 2024, gross loans totaled $1.1 billion, an increase of $50.5 million, or 20.1% annualized since September 30, 2024. During the quarter, loan growth was primarily comprised of commercial real estate (growth of $21.1 million), commercial (growth of $10.7 million), agriculture (growth of $8.6 million) and one-to-four family residential real estate (growth of $7.8 million) loans. Investment securities decreased $38.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2024 and included sales of $36.0 million in low-rate U.S. treasury securities offset by purchases of $18.0 million in market rate U.S. treasury securities. Pre-tax unrealized net losses on the investment securities portfolio increased from $13.3 million at September 30, 2024 to $20.9 million at December 31, 2024 mainly due to higher market rates for these securities at year end.</p><p class=\"\">Period end deposit balances increased $53.3 million to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2024. The increase in deposits was mainly driven by an increase in money market and checking (increase of $71.3 million) but partially offset by declines in certificates of deposit (decrease of $9.2 million) and non-interest-bearing demand deposits (decrease of $8.6 million). The increase in money market and checking accounts was mainly driven by seasonal growth in public fund deposit account balances. Total borrowings decreased $34.7 million during the fourth quarter 2024. At December 31, 2024, the loan to deposits ratio was 78.2% compared to 77.6% in the prior quarter.</p><p class=\"\">Stockholders’ equity decreased to $136.2 million (book value of $23.59 per share) as of December 31, 2024, from $139.7 million (book value of $24.18 per share) as of September 30, 2024. The decrease in stockholders’ equity was due to an increase in accumulated other comprehensive losses as the unrealized net losses on investments securities increased during the fourth quarter. The ratio of equity to total assets decreased to 8.65% on December 31, 2024, from 8.93% on September 30, 2024.</p><p class=\"\">The allowance for credit losses totaled $12.8 million, or 1.22% of total gross loans on December 31, 2024, compared to $11.5 million, or 1.15% of total gross loans on September 30, 2024. Net loan charge-offs totaled $219,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $9,000 during the third quarter of 2024. A provision for credit losses for loans of $1.5 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $650,000 in the third quarter of 2024.</p><p class=\"\">Non-performing loans totaled $13.1 million, or 1.25% of gross loans at December 31, 2024 compared to $13.4 million, or 1.34% of gross loans at September 30, 2024. Loans 30-89 days delinquent declined to $6.2 million, or 0.59% of gross loans, as of December 31, 2024, compared to $7.3 million, or 0.73% of gross loans, as of September 30, 2024.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Landmark</strong></p><p class=\"\">Landmark Bancorp, Inc., the holding company for Landmark National Bank, is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “LARK.” Headquartered in Manhattan, Kansas, Landmark National Bank is a community banking organization dedicated to providing quality financial and banking services.

No-one expects anything other than continued nickel oversupply both this year and next. </p><p class=\"\">Supply dynamics are top of analysts' minds in terms of likely winners and losers this year but a troubled macro picture hangs over the industrial metals complex. </p><p class=\"\">Median forecasts for copper, tin, nickel and lead have all been cut since Reuters' last quarterly poll in October, reflecting concern about the demand impact from a tariff trade war. </p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:1137.265415549598px;aspect-ratio:1.8954423592493297\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3OV0JD-dd2279677af3b0117dd76f9212a2ad95-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"Reuters base metals analyst poll median forecasts\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3OV0JD-dd2279677af3b0117dd76f9212a2ad95-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#191b0f\"/></picture></div><figcaption class=\"caption-S5VA5POt\"><span class=\"copyright-S5VA5POt\">Thomson Reuters</span><span class=\"description-S5VA5POt\">Aluminium is the analyst bull pick for 2025</span></figcaption></figure></span></p><p class=\"\">ALUMINIUM BULLS</p><p class=\"\">The average LME cash aluminium price (CMAL0) rose by 4.9% year-on-year in 2024 and is set to climb another 6.3% to $2,573.50 per metric ton in 2025, according to the median forecast of 33 analysts participating in the January poll. </p><p class=\"\">The outcome was little changed from the October poll, suggesting a hardening conviction in the metal's bullish prospects. </p><p class=\"\">Underpinning the higher price forecast is an expected shift in market dynamics to a supply shortfall. Analysts swung their consensus to a market deficit of 8,000 tons in 2025 from oversupply of 100,000 tons in the previous poll.</p><p class=\"\">The deficit is expected to grow to 365,000 tons in 2026 with the average price lifting further to $2,626 per ton. </p><p class=\"\">Tightness in the alumina market has recently buoyed the aluminium price but the bigger structural supply constraint is China's smelter capacity cap. </p><p class=\"\">China's national output was running at an annualised 43.9 million tons at the end of 2024, close to the 45.0 million cap.</p><p class=\"\">If the world's largest producer has run out of expansion potential, it's far from clear how the rest of the world is going to fill the output gap. </p><p class=\"\">ZINC PRICE RALLY SEEN FADING </p><p class=\"\">Zinc is forecast to be the second-best performer this year with the average cash price expected to increase by 4.2% to $2,895 per ton. </p><p class=\"\">Moreover, analysts lifted their zinc price expectations from the October poll against the broader trend.</p><p class=\"\">This tells you how much the zinc narrative has changed in the last three months. A market expected to register massive oversupply has turned out to be surprisingly tight as a shortfall of mined concentrates drags down global metal production. </p><p class=\"\">However, that should change this year as mine supply recovers and analysts expect zinc prices to weaken over 2025 and 2026. Indeed, zinc is the only LME base metal projected to fall in price next year. </p><p class=\"\">Zinc's premium over sister metal lead will also ease since the consensus is for lead prices to average a steady $2,050 both this year and next. </p><p class=\"\">DIALING BACK ON COPPER</p><p class=\"\">Analysts are dialing back expectations for copper's potential upside. </p><p class=\"\">While the average cash price is expected to rise by 3% to $9,425 per ton this year, the median forecast is 4.8% lower than the October poll. </p><p class=\"\">This should be no great surprise since copper is the LME metal most sensitive to shifts in macro sentiment. </p><p class=\"\">And right now the macro outlook is looking ever more stormy after U.S. president Donald Trump imposed a 10% tariff on imports of Chinese goods. </p><p class=\"\">The carefully calibrated Chinese response offers some hope that trade talks could avert a full trade war but copper is particularly sensitive to any negative consequences for China, the world's largest buyer of the red metal. </p><p class=\"\">The market spent much of last year looking for signs of revival in China's giant manufacturing sector and this year is shaping up to be no different. Tariffs and the threat of more to come muddy the waters. </p><p class=\"\">THINGS CAN ONLY GET BETTER FOR NICKEL</p><p class=\"\">The median nickel forecast for 2025 has also been downgraded by a hefty 5.9% to $16,265 per ton since October as market oversupply becomes increasingly visible in the form of rising LME stocks. </p><p class=\"\">But having already fallen so heavily over the last year, analysts don't think there's much further downside. </p><p class=\"\">The consensus is for LME cash nickel to bottom out at an average $15,550 per ton in the current quarter before edging steadily higher to $16,750 in the fourth quarter.</p><p class=\"\">The price recovery is expected to continue into 2026 with a median cash price forecast of $17,637 per ton. The betting seems to be that Indonesia, the world's dominant producer, will put the brakes on its runaway production growth to shore up prices. </p><p class=\"\">UNPREDICTABLE TIN</p><p class=\"\">Tin has been a particularly volatile market over the last couple of years and there's little consensus as to what is next in store for the soldering metal. </p><p class=\"\">The median forecast is for a modest 2.6% lift in average price this year relative to 2024. </p><p class=\"\">But that masks a very wide range of expectations, stretching from a low of $23,750 to a high of $33,000 per ton. The spectrum of outcomes is an even wider range of $21,000 and $37,000 for 2026. </p><p class=\"\">Which says much about how difficult it is to read this small but profoundly opaque market. </p><p class=\"\">The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.</p></span></div>",
