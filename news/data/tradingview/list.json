Despite stable 4Q GDP growth, policymakers are expected to remain focused on reversing previous rate hikes, he notes. With USD/IDR stable around 16,300, another cut is likely, he reckons. Inflation softened in January, prompting a downward revision to Tan's 2025 average inflation forecast to 1.4% from 1.7%, below BI's 1.5%-3.5% target. If electricity discounts are extended beyond February, inflation could fall further, strengthening the case for continued monetary easing, he adds. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

Trump signed a directive restoring his \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Tehran with the aim to stop the country from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Stricter enforcement of sanctions could put as much as 1 million barrels a day of oil supply at risk, according to ING analysts. \"However, reduced flows from Iran will not help in lowering oil prices, something that President Trump is very keen to achieve,\" they say. \"He would need to see OPEC increase oil output to offset any potential Iranian losses.\" Prices are pressured by fears that a trade war between the U.S. and China could hurt global growth and increase inflationary pressures, damping demand for crude.

Two regions, Sao Paolo in Brazil and Florida in the US, dominate global production and supply. Here, bad weather, a strong US dollar and Brazilian real, and citrus greening disease have contributed to the price trend. We recommend going long when the price has fallen a little further from current levels. Since Friday 31 January, global equity markets have been negatively affected by President Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China.</p><p class=\"\">Uncertain demand, coupled with production problems in both Florida and Brazil, halted the previous linear price increase for frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ). In 2024, Hurricane Milton was devastating to Florida citrus production. In Brazil, excessive drought and high temperatures, combined with citrus greening, have significantly affected production. If demand remains weak, it is possible that prices will follow seasonal patterns and remain subdued in the coming months. On the other hand, Trump tariffs and a strong USD and BRL could artificially boost prices in both directions. A potential investor could enter a long position when the orange juice price touches one of the lower barriers discussed in the article.</p><p class=\"\">US President Trumps proposed tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China made the equity markets tumble on Friday 31 January in the US, followed by a similar reaction on the Asian and European stock markets on Monday 3 February.</p><p class=\"\">Please find out more in our weekly letter on certificates Vontobel.com: <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Read the weekly newsletter here</strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Link to the Swedish-translated version</strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Read more</strong></p></span></div>",

The launch on MEXC will be accompanied by Airdrop+ rewards of 19,100 BERA and 50,000 USDT.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Berachain: From Meme to EVM-Identical Layer 1</strong>Berachain began as a meme, inspired by bear-themed JPEGs, and has since evolved into the creation of an innovative blockchain. It is a Layer 1 network that is both EVM-compatible and powered by a unique Proof of Liquidity (PoL) consensus mechanism. With this mechanism, validators not only stake tokens but also provide liquidity. Through its Proof of Liquidity (PoL) model, Berachain leverages active liquidity providers to secure the network, effectively turning capital into a core security resource.</p><p class=\"\">This groundbreaking approach has attracted significant financial backing, with the project raising $142 million in its latest funding round.

BERA is a gas token, used for transactions and staking within its ecosystem.</p><p class=\"\">Berachain, powered by the BeaconKit modular consensus layer and built on the Cosmos SDK, offers flexibility for Ethereum-based blockchains. It enables developers to create both Layer-1 and Layer-2 solutions without needing to rewrite programming languages. Recently, Berachain launched Boyco, a pre-launch liquidity platform in collaboration with Enso and LayerZero, designed to address the cold start issue for new decentralized applications. Boyco's pre-deposit vaults have already reached $2.2 billion.</p><p class=\"\">Celebrate the BERA Launch with a prize pool of 19,100 BERA &amp; 50,000 USDTIn a significant show of support for Berachain and its expansive ecosystem, MEXC is set to list the new BERA token.
