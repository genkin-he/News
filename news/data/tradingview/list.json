            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Andrew Welsch</p><p class=\"\">Shares of UBS dropped after the Swiss bank cautioned investors that its $3 billion stock buyback plan could be curtailed depending on how Swiss regulators reform capital requirements.</p><p class=\"\">The warning overshadowed other good news in UBS' fourth-quarter earnings report and the bank's plans to improve profitability in its Americas wealth management business, which oversees approximately $2.1 trillion in assets.</p><p class=\"\">On Tuesday, UBS reported fourth-quarter net profit of $770 million, blowing past analyst estimates of $457 million thanks to a surge in investment banking revenue. Diluted earnings per share came in at 23 cents, seven cents below Wall Street estimates, according to FactSet. UBS shares were down 7.1% in New York trading Tuesday afternoon. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.73%.</p><p class=\"\">UBS said it plans to repurchase $1 billion of shares in the first half of the year and an additional $2 billion in the second half. But the Zurich-based company said those plans are subject to certain conditions and assumes no material changes to the current capital regime requirements in Switzerland. CEO Sergio Ermotti, speaking during a call with analysts, cautioned regulators against \"disproportionate\" changes.</p><p class=\"\">\"Offsetting the consequences of higher requirements would make us uncompetitive domestically and abroad, hamper our ability to help clients grow and, importantly, make banking services more expensive for Swiss families and enterprises in the long run,\" he said. \"It will also damage the nation's standing as an attractive global financial center and ultimately hurt our position as the third largest private employer in Switzerland. Of course, this would have an impact on our returns on capital. But even more importantly, it would impede our ability to compete for capital in the global marketplace, particularly in a moment of financial stress.\"</p><p class=\"\">Given the slump in the stock price, investors clearly took note. \"We expect investors will remain cautious about the shares until there is clarity regarding UBS's minimum capital requirements,\" Morningstar analyst Johann Scholtz wrote Tuesday. \"UBS expects the Swiss government to present its proposals in first-half 2025.\"</p><p class=\"\">Wealth. While a jump in investment banking revenue lifted UBS this quarter, the company placed emphasis on improving profitability and asset-gathering in its wealth management business, which along with asset management generates a majority of the company's revenue.</p><p class=\"\">UBS said it aims to increase returns in wealth management and haul in $100 billion in net new assets in 2025. UBS expects that annual figure to increase to approximately $200 billion by 2028 after overcoming some short-term headwinds, including potential financial advisor attrition related to recent changes it made to advisor pay for 2025. UBS trimmed payouts for some advisors with smaller amounts of assets under management as a growth incentive. (Advisor compensation is one of the largest expenses for wealth management companies.) UBS reported $18 billion in net new assets in Global Wealth Management for the fourth quarter and $97 billion in for the full year.</p><p class=\"\">By comparison, rival Morgan Stanley  reported net new assets of $252 billion for all of 2024. Charles Schwab  reported $367 billion for the year.</p><p class=\"\">To achieve its growth goals, UBS said it aims to improve profitability across its Americas wealth business and hit a profit margin of 15% in 2027, up from its current level of approximately 10%. The company says it will work to bring expenses down, efforts that include streamlining organizational structure and adjusting advisor pay.</p><p class=\"\">CFO Todd Tucker told analysts, responding to analysts, said the advisor pay changes were intended to better align compensation with the company's strategy and practices at competitors.</p><p class=\"\">\"It's important to keep in mind that the changes we're making are really not intended to reduce compensation but to increase it as long as it's being done in ways that are very aligned with our strategy, and I think that's the most important point,\" Tucker said.</p><p class=\"\">UBS also wants to win more business with ultrahigh-net-worth and high-net-worth clients and drum up new business with mass-affluent customers. In particular, the company is eyeing how to expand its banking capabilities in the U.S. Lending to wealth management clients can be a lucrative way to win wallet share with existing customers, for instance.</p><p class=\"\">Tucker said UBS is investing in its digital-focused Wealth Advice Center, which serves mass-affluent clients. UBS hopes to \"to make it a more meaningful contributor to organic growth and to lower our cost to serve, \" he said. The company will double its staffing in the Wealth Advice Center to better serve clients.</p><p class=\"\">Tucker described this and other efforts to win more affluent clients was not a change in strategy at UBS, which is \"overweight\" ultrawealthy clients.</p><p class=\"\">\"What we're trying to do is rebalance,\" he said. \"So obviously, stay very penetrated in ultra[wealthy], but increase our penetration in high-net-worth and affluent to create a better balance more in line with the market.\"</p><p class=\"\">He also said UBS is moving ahead with plans to obtain a national bank charter, which would enable it to offer more banking products and services to its clients, but he cautioned that this is a multiyear process.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Andrew Welsch at andrew.welsch@barrons.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Kennedy Jr. to lead the Health and Human Services Department advanced Tuesday after a key swing Republican voted for the nominee in the Senate Finance Committee, likely clearing his path to confirmation.</p><p class=\"\">Sen. Bill Cassidy (R., La.), a medical doctor, voted with all of the committee's Republicans to support Kennedy's confirmation.</p><p class=\"\">His vote followed an unusually intense pressure campaign from Kennedy, his supporters and the Trump administration over the weekend and up to the committee's vote.</p><p class=\"\">To secure Kennedy's support, the nominee and administration agreed to a number of concessions, Cassidy said, including promises to maintain current federal vaccine recommendations and keep intact Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website pages that say there isn't a link between vaccines and autism.</p><p class=\"\">Kennedy and the Trump administration committed to establish \"an unprecedentedly close, collaborative working relationship,\" Cassidy said, and set up safeguards to ensure the public's continued access to vaccines.</p><p class=\"\">\"I will use my authority as chairman of the Senate committee with oversight of HHS to rebuff any attempt to remove the public access to lifesaving vaccines without iron-clad causational scientific evidence,\" Cassidy said on the Senate floor after Tuesday's vote.</p><p class=\"\">The committee vote signaled that Kennedy's path to becoming the top U.S. health official was becoming smoother. The final tally was 14 to 13.</p><p class=\"\">In the full Senate vote, Kennedy can afford to lose as many as three Republican votes if all Democrats oppose him. In the event of a tie, Vice President JD Vance can cast the deciding vote.</p><p class=\"\">Potential GOP defectors include Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, a polio survivor; Lisa Murkowski of Alaska; and Susan Collins of Maine. No Republicans have said they plan to oppose Kennedy.</p><p class=\"\">The full Senate vote to confirm Kennedy hasn't been scheduled but could come as soon as next week.</p><p class=\"\">If confirmed, Kennedy would lead a powerful department with a $1.7 trillion budget regulating things as diverse as prescription medicines and food dyes and overseeing Medicare health insurance for the elderly and health services for Native Americans.</p><p class=\"\">Shares of vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna fell after the Kennedy vote.</p><p class=\"\">Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla told analysts during an earnings call Tuesday he expects Kennedy to have a \"more tempered view\" of vaccines as HHS secretary based on what he has seen from comments from Kennedy and the Trump administration.</p><p class=\"\">Bourla also said he doesn't expect the government to change vaccine manufacturers' liability protections because doing so requires congressional approval. The Trump administration doesn't want to see another health crisis. \"I feel cautiously optimistic that they will be very, very prudent,\" Bourla said.</p><p class=\"\">A scion of the famous Democratic family, Kennedy ran for president last year and then suspended his campaign last summer and endorsed Donald Trump, saying they had a joint mission to \"Make America Healthy Again.\"</p><p class=\"\">The phrase became a rallying cry picked up by many Republicans. Yet many Democrats and health authorities expressed concern over some of its tenets, because Kennedy has questioned the safety of vaccines and suggested unproven links between the shots and a range of chronic diseases, including autism.</p><p class=\"\">More than 20 large-scale studies involving hundreds of thousands of children in several countries have discredited any association between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines and autism. Additional large studies strongly suggest that no vaccine causes autism.</p><p class=\"\">Democrats on the committee said Kennedy could undermine public health if he were confirmed. He had also struggled to answer questions about Medicare and Medicaid over two days of hearings last week.</p><p class=\"\">Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the committee's top Democrat, said Kennedy was \"singularly unfit\" for the post of Health secretary and would pose \"a grave threat to the health of the American people.\"</p><p class=\"\">But Republicans hold a majority on the Finance committee, and most of the GOP committee members had coalesced around Kennedy, even though the nominee had in the past voiced support for abortion rights.</p><p class=\"\">Sen. Thom Tillis (R., N.C.) said the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Rifle Association and groups that oppose abortion rights didn't actively oppose Kennedy.</p><p class=\"\">The partisan divide left Cassidy with the swing vote. His position was fraught. He had voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial. Now, Cassidy faces a primary challenger in his coming election in 2026.</p><p class=\"\">Yet Cassidy had said last week that he had been \"struggling\" over Kennedy's past comments about vaccines and the role they have played in making some parents hesitant to vaccinate their children.</p><p class=\"\">The Louisiana Republican had urged Kennedy during hearings on the nomination to make clear that he didn't believe vaccines caused autism, but Kennedy had sidestepped such an endorsement, saying he would review the data.</p><p class=\"\">Cassidy became the target of an intense persuasion campaign from Kennedy, his supporters and the Trump administration.</p><p class=\"\">\"MAHA moms packed the halls of the Senate and made thousands of calls,\" said Kennedy adviser Calley Means. \"Their voice was heard.\"</p><p class=\"\">As the committee vote neared, President Trump urged lawmakers to support Kennedy in a social-media post. \"20 years ago, Autism in children was 1 in 10,000. NOW IT'S 1 in 34. WOW! Something's really wrong. We need BOBBY!!!\" Trump wrote.</p><p class=\"\">Cassidy said he held a series of phone calls with Kennedy over the weekend and Tuesday morning before the committee's vote. During the calls, the senator said, Kennedy promised an unusually close working relationship.</p><p class=\"\">Cassidy said Kennedy, in addition to keeping federal vaccine recommendations and CDC web pages on vaccines and autism, committed to not set up alternate safety monitoring or approval systems for vaccines.</p><p class=\"\">Kennedy pledged that HHS would provide 30-day notice before any changes to vaccine-safety monitoring systems and would generally speak to Cassidy several times a month, the senator said.</p><p class=\"\">The nominee also offered Cassidy input on hiring decisions at HHS and promised Cassidy that the Senate health committee could choose a representative \"on any board or commission formed to review vaccine safety,\" Cassidy said.</p><p class=\"\">\"My support is built on assurances that this will not have to be a concern,\" Cassidy said of vaccines. \"He will be the secretary, but I believe he will also be a partner.\"</p><p class=\"\">Cassidy arrived late to the committee vote, walking into the room with Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R., S.D.).</p><p class=\"\">\"I've had very intense conversations with Bobby and the White House over the weekend and even this morning,\" Cassidy said in a social-media post shortly before the vote. \"I want to thank VP JD specifically for his honest counsel.\"</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Jared S.

In a move that wasn't explicitly tied to Trump's tariffs, China also said it was starting an antitrust probe into Alphabet's Google, the internet search engine.</p><p class=\"\">Beijing added two U.S. companies to its unreliable entity list — Calvin Klein owner PVH, and biotechnology company Illumina.</p><p class=\"\">\"The two entities have violated normal market-trading principles, terminated regular trade with Chinese companies, and adopted discriminatory measures against Chinese companies,\" state-owned news agency Xinhua reported, citing a statement from the Commerce Ministry.</p><p class=\"\">The ministry said the list only targets the very few foreign entities that undermine China's national security. It means measures could be taken against the companies.</p><p class=\"\">PVH told Barron's the company is \"surprised and deeply disappointed\" by the decision.</p><p class=\"\">China also announced export controls on scarce elements that are critical for making electronics, including tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum, and indium. China is a big miner of these materials.</p><p class=\"\">The moves follow a last minute delay to Trump's plans to raise taxes on imports from Mexico and Canada. That sparked a relief rally in stocks, which had fallen sharply on concern that the new tariffs would fan inflation and hamper economic growth. The question now is whether Trump and China can work out a similar deal to prevent the trade war from escalating further.</p><p class=\"\">Trump is expected to speak with China's President Xi Jinping by phone. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier that the call will happen \"soon,\" and top trade adviser Peter Navarro told Politico in an interview that it would be today. An official told The Wall Street Journal that the call would not be today, however.</p><p class=\"\">Julian Evans-Pritchard, the head of China economics at Capital Economics, said the tariffs could be postponed or cancelled before they come into effect on Feb. 10. \"For the most part, these moves are warnings that China intends to harm U.S. interests if need be but still give China the option to back down.\"</p><p class=\"\">Evans-Pritchard also noted that the Chinese retaliation only targets about $20 billion worth of imports, compared to the $450 billion in Chinese wares that Trump has targeted. What's more, China didn't raise tariffs on strategic goods such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.com and Callum Keown at callum.keown@dowjones.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Studying data over the pandemic and postpandemic period, Maximiliano Dvorkin and Cassie Marks find that during the stretch of high inflation and low unemployment during 2022, wage increases became more likely and larger in scale. Then, they cooled again as the labor market started to normalize in 2023. In 2022, for example, they find that workers had a 55% probability of a positive wage increase, up from 43% in the years before the pandemic. Wage increases fell in likelihood to 53% in 2023, they find. Economists closely study the interconnection between inflation and wages in part to better understand how likely inflation is to become self perpetuating.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Megan Leonhardt and Nicholas Jasinski</p><p class=\"\">President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China could push consumer prices higher, dent U.S. and global economic growth, and create more challenges for the Federal Reserve.</p><p class=\"\">Trump plans to impose a 10% tariff on China and 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods, with the exception of Canadian energy imports, which will face a lower tariff rate of 10%. Tariffs on Mexico and Canada will be delayed by a month as negotiations continue, but levies on China are still set to take effect at midnight on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"\">Imports from all three countries account for just over 42% of all products and raw materials coming into the U.S. Trump's latest tariff proposal would take the effective tariff rate on all U.S. imports up to an average of 10% from less than 3%. The U.S. hasn't experienced this sort of increase since World War II.</p><p class=\"\">Economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimate that the proposed tariffs will drive up inflation by 0.6% in the short-term, and create a 0.2% drag on real gross domestic product growth. U.S. GDP will be around $200 billion lower than it would have been without the tariffs for the duration of Trump's second term in office, according to Peterson economists Warwick McKibbin and Marcus Noland. And that's before any tariff retaliation takes place, which all three countries have vowed to implement.</p><p class=\"\">The tariffs are likely to weigh on business investment, a key component of economic growth, writes Bernard Yaros, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. Even if the current proposed tariffs are \"watered down this year and eventually lifted,\" Yaros expects the threat alone could cut growth in the housing market and business investment in structures by one percentage point and 1.6 percentage points, respectively, this year.</p><p class=\"\">Morgan Stanley's economists estimate that the drag on real business investment could be as high as 2.2%.</p><p class=\"\">The effects of a trade war would be more severe for Canada and Mexico than the U.S., however, largely because exports to the U.S. account for a larger share of GDP for both countries than the U.S. Morgan Stanley economists expect a recession in Mexico if tariffs are implemented at their currently proposed levels. Mexico's GDP is expected to grow by 1.2% this year, and Canada's, by 1.8%, according to FactSet.</p><p class=\"\">Much of any U.S. cost increase caused by tariffs will be passed on to American consumers, a fact that President Trump seemed to acknowledge in a social media post on Sunday.</p><p class=\"\">\"The burden will fall disproportionally on low-income households,\" writes James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.</p><p class=\"\">That's because lower-income Americans tend to spend more of their income on physical goods relative to higher-income households, which spend more on services and experiences, neither of which are subject to tariffs.</p><p class=\"\">If consumers don't shift to American-made products from imports, and if producers pass through 100% of these tariffs, Knightley calculates that would result in increased spending of $835 for every man, woman and child in America. A family of four would have $3,342 in additional expenses annually, on average. While lower-income households account for a smaller share of overall consumer spending, the increased costs could lead to a broader pullback in spending.</p><p class=\"\">Companies could absorb all or part of the added cost of tariffs, but few seem willing to do so.</p><p class=\"\">\"One of the things that we've been asking [in surveys of] businesses is, if you're hit with a tariff, what are you likely to do?\" Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic said on Monday. \"What they've told us is they expect to pass it through 100%.\"</p><p class=\"\">If consumers rebel, he added, \"they may make a different decision. So experience will guide this in a pretty significant way.\"</p><p class=\"\">If Trump's tariffs are fully implemented, food and energy prices could feel the impact quickly; it would show up in the headline consumer price index as early as February, according to Citi economist Veronica Clark. More than a quarter of U.S. food imports are from Mexico, as are more than half of all vegetables, nuts, and fruits brought into the country. But it may take a bit longer, or roughly three months, until the tariffs on consumer goods start to take hold. That's what happened in 2018, when the first Trump administration placed tariffs on all imports of washing machines.</p><p class=\"\">If the tariffs are short-lived, as some expect, the effect on consumer prices could be minimal. Brian Gardner, Stifel's chief Washington policy strategist, believes that a negotiated settlement is the most likely outcome.</p><p class=\"\">\"The pretext of the tariffs was fentanyl, but in interviews, President Trump cited trade deficits,\" Gardner writes. \"This suggests that the administration is looking for a political deal. It could be on trade, it could be on fentanyl, but it seems like the administration wants to be able to claim some tangible benefits.\"</p><p class=\"\">History shows that poor economic outcomes typically have followed broad-based tariffs, writes Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital. While Trump has praised President McKinley's protectionist policies, DeQuadros notes that McKinley's tariff regime resulted in such poor economic outcomes — including bouts of inflation — and were so unpopular with the public that McKinley later repudiated the policy.</p><p class=\"\">For the Federal Reserve — already in wait-and-see mode regarding any near-term change in interest rates — tariffs' impact on policy decisions will depend on how long they remain in place, how much of the cost is passed through to consumers, and how other countries respond. In their recent public remarks, many Fed officials have described tariffs as a one-time increase in the price level, rather than a sustained source of inflationary pressure that would demand a response in the form of higher interest rates.</p><p class=\"\">Trump is presumably aware of the risk of igniting inflation via tariffs.</p><p class=\"\">\"Mr. Trump ran for President on a platform that included tariffs, but he also ran on lowering prices for consumers,\" wrote David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"The fact that the tariffs include a lower levy on energy imports from Canada suggests that the administration is aware of the potential conflict between the two goals. This also supports our view that a deal is the ultimate goal. The administration understands the political risk of higher prices.\"</p><p class=\"\">Write to Megan Leonhardt at megan.leonhardt@barrons.com and Nicholas Jasinski at nicholas.jasinski@barrons.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Gold jumps to a record high, with the front-month contract rising 0.7% to $2,853.30 a troy ounce. The move keeps gold's positive momentum going, after it recorded net outflows in last week's trading, according to data from JPMorgan Global Commodities Research. The firm says that for the week ended Jan. 31, open interest in precious metals fell 4.6%, or by $11.3 billion. The firm attributes the decline to outflows in gold contracts, but uncertainty around trade tariffs is pushing investors back into the safe haven asset. Year-to-date, continuous gold futures have risen nearly 9%. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
