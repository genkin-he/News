Net earnings for the 2024 fourth quarter included net after-tax non-core realized losses of $7 million ($0.09 per share loss). By comparison, net earnings for the 2023 fourth quarter included net after-tax non-core realized gains of $25 million ($0.29 per share). Net earnings for the full year of 2024 were $10.57 per share, compared to $10.05 per share in 2023. Return on equity was 19.0% and 18.8% for the full years of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and is calculated excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). Other details may be found in the table on the following page.</p><p class=\"\">Core net operating earnings were $262 million ($3.12 per share) for the 2024 fourth quarter, compared to $238 million ($2.84 per share) in the 2023 fourth quarter. The year-over-year increase reflects higher P&amp;C net investment income, including improved returns on alternative investments, partially offset by lower P&amp;C underwriting profit. Additional details for the 2024 and 2023 fourth quarters may be found in the table below. Core net operating earnings generated returns on equity of 19.3% and 19.8% for the full years of 2024 and 2023, respectively, calculated excluding AOCI.</p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"> <br/>                          Three Months Ended December 31, <br/>                 ------------------------------------------------- <br/> Components of <br/> Pretax Core <br/> Operating <br/> Earnings         2024    2023       2024   2023   2024    2023 <br/>---------------   ----    ----       ----   ----   ----    ---- <br/> In millions, <br/> except per      Before Impact                        Core Net <br/> share amounts         of          Alternative       Operating <br/>                  Alternative                       Earnings, as <br/>                  Investments      Investments        reported <br/>                 --------------  ---------------  ---------------- <br/> <br/> P&amp;C Pretax <br/>  Core <br/>  Operating <br/>  Earnings       $ 345   $ 352    $    33  $   5  $ 378   $ 357 <br/> Other expenses    (29)    (34)         -      -    (29)    (34) <br/> Holding <br/>  company <br/>  interest <br/>  expense          (19)    (19)         -      -    (19)    (19) <br/>                  ----    ----       ----   ----   ----    ---- <br/> Pretax Core <br/>  Operating <br/>  Earnings         297     299         33      5    330     304 <br/>     Related <br/>      provision <br/>      for <br/>      income <br/>      taxes         61      65          7      1     68      66 <br/>                  ----    ----       ----   ----   ----    ---- <br/> Core Net <br/>  Operating <br/>  Earnings       $ 236   $ 234    $    26  $   4  $ 262   $ 238 <br/>                  ====    ====       ====   ====   ====    ==== <br/> <br/> Core Operating <br/>  Earnings Per <br/>  Share          $2.81   $2.79    $  0.31  $0.05  $3.12   $2.84 <br/> <br/> Weighted Avg <br/>  Diluted <br/>  Shares <br/>  Outstanding     84.0    83.8       84.0   83.8   84.0    83.8 <br/> </pre><p class=\"\">AFG's book value per share was $53.18 at December 31, 2024. AFG paid cash dividends of $4.80 per share during the fourth quarter, which included a $4.00 per share special dividend paid in November.

The table below identifies such items and reconciles net earnings to core net operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure. AFG believes that its core net operating earnings provides management, financial analysts, ratings agencies, and investors with an understanding of the results from the ongoing operations of the Company by excluding the impact of net realized gains and losses and other items that are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. AFG's management uses core net operating earnings to evaluate financial performance against historical results because it believes this provides a more comparable measure of its continuing business. Core net operating earnings is also used by AFG's management as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting.</p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"> <br/>   In millions, <br/> except per share    Three months ended        Twelve months ended <br/>     amounts            December 31,               December 31, <br/>                   ----------------------  --------------------------- <br/>                         2024       2023        2024          2023 <br/>                       --------    ------      -------       ------ <br/> Components of <br/> net earnings: <br/>   Core operating <br/>    earnings <br/>    before income <br/>    taxes           $       330   $   304   $    1,138      $ 1,127 <br/>   Pretax <br/>   non-core <br/>   items: <br/>----------------- <br/>     Realized <br/>      gains <br/>      (losses)              (10)       31            -          (40) <br/>     Gain on <br/>      retirement <br/>      of debt                 -         -            -            1 <br/>     Special A&amp;E <br/>      charges                 -         -          (14)         (15) <br/>                       --------    ------      -------       ------ <br/>       Earnings <br/>        before <br/>        income <br/>        taxes               320       335        1,124        1,073 <br/>   Provision <br/>   (credit) for <br/>   income taxes: <br/>     Core <br/>      operating <br/>      earnings               68        66          236          232 <br/>     Non-core <br/>      items                  (3)        6            1          (11) <br/>                       --------    ------      -------       ------ <br/>       Total <br/>        provision <br/>        for <br/>        income <br/>        taxes                65        72          237          221 <br/>                       --------    ------      -------       ------ <br/> Net earnings       $       255   $   263   $      887      $   852 <br/>                       ========    ======      =======       ====== <br/> <br/> Net earnings: <br/>   Core net <br/>    operating <br/>    earnings(a)     $       262   $   238   $      902      $   895 <br/> Non-core items: <br/>----------------- <br/>   Realized gains <br/>    (losses)                 (7)       25           (4)         (32) <br/>   Gain on <br/>    retirement of <br/>    debt                      -         -            -            1 <br/>   Special A&amp;E <br/>    charges                   -         -          (11)         (12) <br/>                       --------    ------      -------       ------ <br/> Net earnings       $       255   $   263   $      887      $   852 <br/>                       ========    ======      =======       ====== <br/> <br/> <br/> Components of <br/>  earnings per <br/>  share: <br/>   Core net <br/>    operating <br/>    earnings(a)     $      3.12   $  2.84   $    10.75      $ 10.56 <br/>   Non-core <br/>   Items: <br/>----------------- <br/>     Realized <br/>      gains <br/>      (losses)            (0.09)     0.29        (0.05)       (0.37) <br/>     Gain on <br/>      retirement <br/>      of debt                 -         -            -         0.01 <br/>     Special A&amp;E <br/>      Charges                 -         -        (0.13)       (0.15) <br/>                       --------    ------      -------       ------ <br/> Diluted net <br/>  earnings per <br/>  share             $      3.03   $  3.13   $    10.57      $ 10.05 <br/>                       ========    ======      =======       ====== <br/> <br/> <br/>Footnote (a) is contained in the accompanying Notes to Financial Schedules at <br/>the end of this release. <br/> </pre><p class=\"\">Carl H. Lindner III and S. Craig Lindner, AFG's Co-Chief Executive Officers, issued this statement: \"We are very pleased with AFG's performance in the 2024 fourth quarter and full year. In addition to producing an annual core operating return on equity in excess of 19%, net written premiums grew by 7% during the year. Excellent underwriting results, record P&amp;C net investment income and effective capital management enable us to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders. We are thankful for our talented insurance and investment professionals, who have positioned us well as we enter 2025. Our thoughts and prayers continue to include those who have been impacted by the devastation caused by the wildfires in Southern California. We are grateful to our claims professionals and insurance specialists who are helping our policyholders recover, restore their businesses and rebuild their communities.\"</p><p class=\"\">Messrs. Lindner continued: \"AFG continued to have significant excess capital at December 31, 2024. Returning capital to shareholders in the form of regular and special cash dividends and through opportunistic share repurchases is an important and effective component of our capital management strategy. In addition, our capital will be deployed into AFG's core businesses as we identify potential for healthy, profitable organic growth, and opportunities to expand our specialty niche businesses through acquisitions and start-ups that meet our target return thresholds. Over the past year, we increased our quarterly dividend by 12.7% and paid special dividends of $6.50 per share. Growth in book value per share (excluding AOCI) plus dividends was a very strong 20% during 2024.\" While AFG does not provide earnings guidance, for 2025 we expect that performance in line with the assumptions underlying our 2025 business plan would result in core operating earnings per share of approximately $10.50 and generate a very strong core operating return on equity excluding AOCI of approximately 18%. These assumptions include 5% growth in net written premiums compared to 2024, a 92.5% calendar year combined ratio, a reinvestment rate of approximately 5.75%, and a return of approximately 8% on our $2.7 billion portfolio of alternative investments. Our current estimate for losses related to the Southern California wildfires is $60 to $70 million, acknowledging that this remains a developing situation. This range is embedded in our 2025 assumptions.</p><p class=\"\">Specialty Property and Casualty Insurance Operations</p><p class=\"\">The Specialty P&amp;C insurance operations generated a strong 89.0% combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2024, 1.3 points higher than the 87.7% reported in the prior year quarter. Fourth quarter results include 1.1 points related to catastrophe losses (primarily the result of Hurricane Milton), compared to 1.4 points in the 2023 fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2024 results include 1.8 points of adverse prior year reserve development, compared to 3.3 points of favorable prior year reserve development in the fourth quarter of 2023. Underwriting profit was $204 million for the 2024 fourth quarter compared to $212 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Higher underwriting profit in our Property and Transportation and Specialty Financial Groups was more than offset by lower year-over-year underwriting profit in our Specialty Casualty Group, which was impacted by adverse prior year reserve development in certain social inflation-exposed businesses.</p><p class=\"\">Fourth quarter 2024 gross and net written premiums were up 3% and 1%, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2023. Gross and net written premiums increased 9% and 7%, respectively, for the full year in 2024 and established new records for premium production for AFG. We continue to achieve year-over-year premium growth as a result of a combination of new business opportunities, a good renewal rate environment, and increased exposures in many of our businesses.</p><p class=\"\">Average renewal pricing across our P&amp;C Group, excluding workers' compensation, was up approximately 8% for the quarter. Including workers' compensation, renewal rates were up approximately 7% overall; both measures were in line with renewal rates in the previous quarter. We believe we are achieving overall renewal rate increases in excess of prospective loss ratio trends to meet or exceed targeted returns.</p><p class=\"\">The Property and Transportation Group reported an underwriting profit of $82 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $67 million in the comparable prior year period. The improvement was attributable to higher year-over-year underwriting profitability in our crop insurance operations. Catastrophe losses in this group were $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $5 million in the prior year period. The businesses in the Property and Transportation Group achieved a strong 89.2% calendar year combined ratio overall in the fourth quarter, an improvement of 1.1 points over the 90.3% achieved in the comparable period in 2023.</p><p class=\"\">Fourth quarter 2024 gross and net written premiums in this group were both down 6% from the comparable prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower year-over-year commodity pricing on winter wheat premiums, coupled with elevated pricing competition and the non-renewal of certain under-performing accounts in our transportation businesses. Overall renewal rates in this group increased 7% on average for the fourth quarter of 2024, in line with pricing the previous quarter. Pricing for the full year for this group was up 8% overall.</p><p class=\"\">The Specialty Casualty Group reported an underwriting profit of $82 million in the 2024 fourth quarter compared to $114 million in the comparable 2023 period. Higher year-over-year underwriting profits in our targeted markets businesses were more than offset by lower underwriting profit in our excess liability, workers' compensation, and executive liability businesses. Underwriting profitability in our workers' compensation and executive liability businesses continues to be excellent despite the lower year-over-year profitability in these businesses. Catastrophe losses for this group, including the impact of lower than previously anticipated estimated losses from Hurricane Helene, had a favorable impact of $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to catastrophe losses of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The businesses in the Specialty Casualty Group achieved a very strong 89.0% calendar year combined ratio overall in the fourth quarter, 4.4 points higher than the excellent 84.6% reported in the comparable period in 2023.</p><p class=\"\">Fourth quarter 2024 gross and net written premiums in this group increased 5% and 4%, respectively, when compared to the same prior year period. The primary drivers of growth were new business opportunities and favorable renewal pricing in several of our targeted markets businesses and in our excess &amp; surplus lines business. Our mergers &amp; acquisitions business also benefited from an increase in M&amp;A activity. This growth was tempered by lower year-over-year workers' compensation premiums. Excluding workers' compensation, fourth quarter gross and net written premiums in this group both grew 8% year over year. Excluding workers' compensation, renewal pricing for this group was up 11% in the fourth quarter, an improvement of about a point from the previous quarter. Pricing in this group, including workers' compensation, was up 8%, in line with the third quarter. For the full year, pricing in this group excluding workers' compensation was 9%.</p><p class=\"\">The Specialty Financial Group reported an underwriting profit of $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $45 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily as a result of higher underwriting profit in our financial institutions business. Catastrophe losses for this group were $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. This group continued to achieve excellent underwriting margins and reported an outstanding 80.7% combined ratio for the fourth quarter of 2024, an improvement of 0.6 points over the prior year period.</p><p class=\"\">Gross and net written premiums in this group increased by 11% and 12%, respectively, in the 2024 fourth quarter when compared to the same 2023 period, primarily due to growth in our financial institutions business. Renewal pricing in this group was up 3% in the fourth quarter and up 6% for the full year of 2024.</p><p class=\"\">Carl Lindner III stated, \"We closed 2024 on a strong note, with each of our Specialty P&amp;C businesses reporting fourth quarter calendar year combined ratios less than 90%. In addition to these strong underwriting margins, we are finding opportunities to grow through new business opportunities, a continued favorable pricing environment and increased exposures. Nearly all the businesses in our diversified Specialty P&amp;C portfolio continue to meet or exceed targeted returns, and we set new records for premium production in 2024. We continue to feel confident about the strength of our reserves, and I am especially pleased that we achieved a fourth quarter average renewal rate increase of 11% in our Specialty Casualty Group, excluding workers' compensation, which is our most social inflation-exposed group of businesses.\"</p><p class=\"\">Further details about AFG's Specialty P&amp;C operations may be found in the accompanying schedules and in our Quarterly Investor Supplement, which is posted on our website.</p><p class=\"\">Investments</p><p class=\"\">Net Investment Income — For the quarter ended December 31, 2024, property and casualty net investment income was approximately 21% higher than the comparable 2023 period as a result of improved returns on alternative investments and the impact of rising interest rates and higher balances of invested assets. The annualized return on alternative investments was approximately 4.9% for the 2024 fourth quarter compared to 0.8% for the prior year quarter. Earnings from alternative investments may vary from quarter to quarter based on the reported results of the underlying investments and generally are reported on a quarter lag.</p><p class=\"\">For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, P&amp;C net investment income was approximately 8% higher than the comparable 2023 period due primarily to the impact of rising interest rates and higher balances of invested assets. The return on alternative investments was 6.1% for 2024 compared to 7.0% earned on P&amp;C alternative investments in 2023. The average annual return on alternative investments over the five calendar years ended December 31, 2024, was approximately 12%.</p><p class=\"\">Non-Core Net Realized Gains (Losses) — AFG recorded fourth quarter 2024 net realized losses of $7 million ($0.09 per share) after tax, which included less than $1 million ($0.01 per share) in after-tax net losses to adjust equity securities that the Company continued to own at December 31, 2024, to fair value. AFG recorded net realized gains of $25 million ($0.29 per share) after tax in the comparable 2023 period.</p><p class=\"\">After-tax unrealized losses related to fixed maturities were $212 million at December 31, 2024. Our portfolio continues to be high quality, with 94% of our fixed maturity portfolio rated investment grade and 96% of our P&amp;C fixed maturity portfolio with a National Association of Insurance Commissioners' designation of NAIC 1 or 2, its highest two categories.</p><p class=\"\">More information about the components of our investment portfolio may be found in our Quarterly Investor Supplement, which is posted on our website.</p><p class=\"\">About American Financial Group, Inc.</p><p class=\"\">American Financial Group is an insurance holding company, based in Cincinnati, Ohio.

(“Finning”, the “Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”) reported fourth quarter and annual 2024 results today. All monetary amounts are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p><p class=\"\">All comparisons are to Q4 2023 results unless indicated otherwise.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Q4 2024 revenue of $2.9 billion and net revenue of $2.6 billion were up 8% and 7%, respectively, driven by a 12% increase in new equipment revenue and a 6% increase in product support revenue. Full year 2024 net revenue of $10.1 billion was up 6% relative to full year 2023.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Q4 2024 EBIT (1) was $223 million. EBIT as a percentage of net revenue (2) was 8.7%, down 90 basis points from Q4 2023 Adjusted EBIT as a percentage of net revenue (2)(4), with substantial improvements in the UK and Ireland offset primarily by lower margins in our Canadian business.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Q4 2024 EBIT as a percentage of net revenue was 10.9% in South America, 8.1% in Canada and 5.8% in the UK &amp; Ireland.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Q4 2024 SG&amp;A (1) as a percentage of net revenue (2) was 16.0%, a decrease of 30 basis points from Q4 2023.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Q4 2024 EPS (1) of $1.02 was a Q4 record, up 7% from Q4 2023 Adjusted EPS (2)(4).</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Q4 2024 free cash flow (3) was $399 million, bringing full year 2024 free cash flow to $865 million.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">2024 year-end net debt to Adjusted EBITDA (1)(2)(4) was 1.5 times, down from 1.7 times in Q3 2024.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Equipment backlog (2) of $2.6 billion at December 31, 2024 was up 14% from September 30, 2024 reflecting strong order intake from mining and construction customers. Equipment backlog was also up 27% from December 31, 2023.</li></ul><p class=\"\">“Overall, 2024 was another strong year for Finning. Through the commitment of our employees, we have built a stronger and more resilient company to reliably service our customers. We are proud to have achieved several important milestones in 2024 including records of $10.1 billion of total net revenue and $5.5 billion of product support revenue. We delivered this growth in 2024 while also achieving record low SG&amp;A as a percentage of net revenue of 16.3% and substantial free cash flow of $865 million. Importantly, we exited the year with strong momentum including record Q4 EPS of $1.02 while concurrently generating Q4 free cash flow of $399 million and rebuilding our backlog to a robust $2.6 billion,” said Kevin Parkes, President and CEO.</p><p class=\"\">“I am very pleased with how each region finished the fourth quarter. South America delivered product support revenue growth over 10%, our UK and Ireland team more than doubled their EBIT through effective strategy execution, and Canada demonstrated resilience, sequentially improving EBIT in difficult market conditions. The geographic and end market diversity of our business was critical to our strong performance in 2024, and this diversity, with approximately half of our business outside of Canada, will remain important as we move through 2025.”  </p><p class=\"\">“Our focus in 2025 will remain squarely on executing our strategy to maximize product support, drive full-cycle resilience and grow our used, rental and power businesses to improve our return on invested capital,” said Mr. Parkes.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Q4 2024 FINANCIAL SUMMARY</strong></p><div

Mr. Carter was appointed Chair of the Board on April 1, 2024 as part of the company’s Board Chair transition plan and will retire from the Board at the annual meeting after serving 18 years as a director.</p><p class=\"\">Mr. Ruigrok joined Finning’s Board in 2023 and serves as chair of the Human Resources Committee and as a member of the Governance and Risk Committee. Mr. Ruigrok has over 40 years of business and executive experience in the energy industry, including having served as Chief Executive Officer of Syncrude Canada Ltd. and prior to Syncrude, 26 years at Imperial Oil Limited in various senior executive positions. Mr. Ruigrok currently serves as Board Chair of ENMAX Corporation.</p><p class=\"\">“It’s an honour to be selected as Finning’s next Board Chair. I look forward to working with my Board colleagues and the Finning leadership team to continue executing on Finning’s strategy,\" said Mr. Ruigrok. Mr. Ruigrok added, “On behalf of the Board, I extend our gratitude to Jim for his unwavering commitment to the interests of our stakeholders over his 18-year tenure. His extensive experience in the oil sands and long-term customer perspective have been invaluable. We are a stronger and more resilient company today because of Jim’s leadership and contributions.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">MARKET UPDATE AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK</strong></p><p class=\"\">The discussion of our expectations relating to the market and business outlook in this section is forward-looking information that is based upon the assumptions and subject to the material risks discussed under the heading “Forward-Looking Information Caution” at the end of this news release. Actual outcomes and results may vary significantly.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">South America Operations</strong></p><p class=\"\">In Chile, our outlook is underpinned by growing global demand for copper, strong copper prices, capital deployment into large-scale brownfield expansions, and customer confidence to invest in brownfield and greenfield projects. We are seeing a broad-based level of quoting, tender, and award activity for mining equipment, product support, and technology solutions. While activity levels and outlook remain positive, we also expect a more challenging environment in attracting and retaining qualified labour.</p><p class=\"\">In the Chilean construction sector, we continue to see demand from large contractors supporting mining operations, and we expect infrastructure construction activity to remain steady. In the power systems sector, activity remains strong in the industrial and data centre markets, driving growing demand for electric power solutions.</p><p class=\"\">In Argentina, we continue to take a low-risk approach, while at the same time, we are positioning our business to capture opportunities, particularly in the oil &amp; gas and mining sectors. The operating environment remains dynamic, and we continue to closely monitor the government’s new rules and policies, some of which are helping drive large-scale investment.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Canada Operations </strong></p><p class=\"\">Our outlook for Western Canada is mixed. We expect continued spending discipline from our large customers as they work to achieve operating cost targets. Going forward, we expect these customers to deploy capital to renew, maintain, and rebuild aging fleets. Based on customer commitments and discussions, we anticipate stable demand for product support, including component remanufacturing and rebuilds. The recent government changes and announcements in Canada and the US, including tariffs, create additional uncertainty for our business and our customers.</p><p class=\"\">We expect ongoing commitments from federal and provincial governments as well as private sector projects for infrastructure development to support activity in the construction sector, but we expect these projects will take time to advance. In addition, growing demand for reliable, efficient, and sustainable electric power solutions across communities in Western Canada creates opportunities for our power systems business.</p><p class=\"\">With slower growth and a more uncertain market environment in the near-term, we are focused on managing our cost and working capital levels and continue to see additional opportunities to unlock invested capital. We are also continuously evaluating opportunities to assess and execute opportunities to optimize low-ROIC activities. We anticipate leveraging the structural changes and overhead reductions strategy demonstrated in our UK operations.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">UK &amp; Ireland Operations</strong></p><p class=\"\">With low GDP (1) growth projected in the UK to continue, we expect demand in the construction sector to remain soft. We expect a growing contribution from used equipment and power systems as we continue to execute on our strategy. In power systems, quoting activity remains strong, driven by healthy demand for primary and backup power generation, particularly in the data centre market. We expect our product support business in the UK &amp; Ireland to remain resilient.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Strategy Execution, Cost and Capital Focus</strong></p><p class=\"\">We expect our 2025 net capital and net rental fleet expenditures to be above our 2024 spend of $219 million. These planned expenditures are expected to include regular maintenance capital as well as expenditures to add capabilities and capacity to serve the growing markets in South America and reposition and build our rental fleet in Canada as the market recovers.</p><p class=\"\">As we progress through 2025, we remain focused on the steady execution of our strategic plan: maximize product support, continuously improve our cost and capital position to drive full-cycle resilience and grow prudently in used, rental and power. Consistent execution, despite macroeconomic and market uncertainties, will enable us to meet our objective of achieving a sustainably higher Adjusted ROIC.</p><p class=\"\">To access Finning's complete Q4 and annual 2024 results, please visit our website at https://www.finning.com/en_CA/company/investors.html</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Q4 2024 INVESTOR CALL</strong></p><p class=\"\">We will hold an investor call on February 5, 2025 at 10:00 am Eastern Time.

The specified financial measures we use do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Accordingly, specified financial measures should not be considered as a substitute or alternative for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP (GAAP financial measures). By considering these specified financial measures in combination with the comparable GAAP financial measures (where available) we believe that users are provided a better overall understanding of our business and financial performance during the relevant period than if they simply considered the GAAP financial measures alone.</p><p class=\"\">We use KPIs to consistently measure performance against our priorities across the organization. Some of our KPIs are specified financial measures.</p><p class=\"\">There may be significant items that we do not consider indicative of our operational and financial trends, either by nature or amount. We exclude these items when evaluating our operating financial performance. These items may not be non-recurring, but we believe that excluding these significant items from GAAP financial measures provides a better understanding of our financial performance when considered in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. Financial measures that have been adjusted to take these significant items into account are referred to as “Adjusted” measures. Adjusted measures are specified financial measures and are intended to provide additional information to readers of the Earnings Release.</p><p class=\"\">Descriptions and components of the specified financial measures we use in this Earnings Release are set out below.

The tax impact of each significant item is calculated by applying the relevant applicable tax rate for the jurisdiction in which the significant item occurred. The after-tax per share impact of significant items is calculated by dividing the after-tax amount of significant items by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.</p><p class=\"\">A reconciliation between EPS (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) and Adjusted EPS can be found on page 9 of this Earnings Release<strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">.</strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA</strong></p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA exclude items that we do not consider to be indicative of operational and financial trends, either by nature or amount, to provide a better overall understanding of our underlying business performance.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding depreciation and amortization to Adjusted EBIT.</p><p class=\"\">The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBIT is EBIT.</p><p class=\"\">Significant items identified by management that affected our results were as follows:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">In Q3 2024, we recorded severance costs related to the headcount reductions and consolidation efforts focused on non-revenue generating positions, including selected technology and supply chain roles as well as some financial support functions as we simplify our business activities in each of our regions.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">In Q3 2024, our Canadian operations recorded an estimated loss for receivables from Victoria Gold, a mining customer that was placed into receivership following a landslide at its mine.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">On December 13, 2023, the newly-elected Argentine government devalued the ARS official exchange rate by 118% from 366.5 ARS to 800 ARS for USD 1. As a result of prolonged government currency restrictions, including no material access to USD starting in late August 2023, our ARS exposure increased and during this period economic hedges were not available. As a result of the growth in our ARS exposure and the significant devaluation of the ARS in the fourth quarter, our South American operations incurred a foreign exchange loss of $56 million which exceeds the typical foreign exchange impact in the region.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">We began to implement our invested capital improvement plan as outlined at our 2023 Investor Day, which targets selling and optimizing real estate and exiting low-ROIC activities. In Q4 2023:  <ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Our South American operations sold a property in Chile and recorded a gain of $13 million on the sale; and,</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Following an evaluation of the business needs of our operations and related intangible assets, several software and technology assets have been or will be decommissioned, and as a result, we derecognized previously capitalized costs of $12 million.</li></ul> </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">In Q1 2023, we executed various transactions to simplify and adjust our organizational structure.

These projects have been advanced through compilation of historical data, new geological mapping, geochemical and geophysical surveys and, at Shasta, 13,250 m of modern HQ drill testing of the known mineralization occurrences and their potential extensions. In January 2025, TDG published an updated Mineral Resource Estimate for Shasta (news release January 08, 2025) which remains open at depth and along strike. In January 2023, TDG defined a larger exploration target area adjacent to Shasta (‘Greater Shasta-Newberry'; news release Jan 25, 2023) which is located directly adjacent to the AuRORA1 discovery announced by Freeport McMoran Inc. and Amarc Resources Ltd (news release January 17, 2025).

The company currently has two therapeutic programs in development, including peripheral neuropathy caused by erythromelalgia, which is an orphan disease, (ADB-101), and Adolore's lead program (ADB-102) treating patients with chronic pain caused by moderate-to-severe knee osteoarthritis. Based on compelling preclinical data, the Company is progressing these programs toward Investigational New Drug, (\"IND\"), filings and first-in-human clinical studies.
