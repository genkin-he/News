            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">1047 ET - Duration from a long-term perspective looks attractive, although the tactical--or short-term--case for being long U.S. duration has become more challenging, says MFS Investment Management's Benoit Anne in a note. The case for fixed income is even stronger outside of the U.S., he says. In Europe, there are strong arguments in favor of both tactical and strategic exposure to fixed income given the significant monetary policy divergence between the U.S. and the eurozone, he says. The Federal Reserve paused last week, while the European Central Bank cut interest rates by 25 basis points. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1028 ET - Germany's current political turmoil, with elections to be held later this month, should have a muted impact on German government bonds, says MFS Investment Management's Annalisa Piazza in a note. \"Swap spreads have moved well in advance and are already pricing in some political and policy changes (such as more fiscal space),\" the fixed income research analyst says. MFS IM expects the German bond curve to remain the go-to safe haven among eurozone government bonds in the medium term. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1008 ET - The euro has limited scope to recover even as hopes rise that the EU can avert threatened U.S. trade tariffs after President Trump postponed a levy on Canadian and Mexican imports, ING's Francesco Pesole says in a note. Trump's decision to delay tariffs on his U.S. neighbors could reflect domestic backlash over potential economic pain for U.S. consumers but the same isn't necessarily true for the EU, he says. Trump can afford to keep EU tariffs in place for a prolonged period, making the bloc feel some pain before striking a deal. \"With all this in mind, we are somewhat sceptical that the euro is bound for a major rally.\" The euro rises 0.2% to $1.0364. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0956 ET - As the threat of U.S. tariffs on imports from Canada continues to loom, the ongoing uncertainty makes it challenging for small business owners to plan and make decisions on their operations, warns the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. The association, which represents about 100,000 members, said that as both countries catch their breath Canada still needs to focus on critical changes needed to prepare for the future. This, the federation suggests, means taking the opportunity now to bring in policies that improve the investment climate, reduce taxes, slash red tape and break down internal trade barriers in the country to ensure Canada is prepared no matter what external threats come its way. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)</p><p class=\"\">0940 ET - With tariffs paused but still looming, Canada's automotive industry continues to stress the integrated nature of the industry in North America and the damage levies could cause. The Canadian Automotive Partnership Council in a meeting with Canadian lawmakers warned tariffs pose an existential threat to the industry in Canada and the U.S. and costs ultimately being borne by consumers. The industry body notes bilateral automotive trade is balanced, with Canadian exports to the U.S. at C$82 billion and imports at C$79 billion in 2023. And it stresses Canadian-made vehicles don't pose a threat to U.S. automotive jobs or production mandates: fewer than 10% of vehicles sold in the U.S. are produced in Canada, whereas the U.S. assembles about half of the vehicles sold in Canada and exports more vehicles to Canada than to any other country. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)</p><p class=\"\">0931 ET - Canada-U.S. trade uncertainty has just begun, even if a 30-day reprieve on U.S. tariffs and Canadian countermeasures has been agreed to, Scotiabank's Derek Holt says. President Trump's comments that tariffs are paused to see whether or not a final economic deal with Canada can be structured suggests the countries go into USMCA negotiations with an unrealistic timeline, the economist says. If Trump pushes for a rapid trade deal and Canada digs in over important issues, the tariff threat could be repeated. Or the next issue for the White House could be a push for an unrealistic 5% of GDP to be spent on defense spending accompanied by threatened tariffs, Holt says. \"Throughout it all, whippy markets and high uncertainty will prevail and that carries a real, tangible cost to the economy and markets.\" (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)</p><p class=\"\">0927 ET - The market doesn't look convinced that sterling is a robust hedge against the prospect of rising U.S.-EU trade tensions, Rabobank's Jane Foley says in a note. President Trump said he would \"definitely\" impose tariffs on the EU. With the U.S. maintaining a trade surplus with the U.K., the U.K. was never going to be prominent within Trump's tariff plans, Foley says. However, the U.K. is unlikely to be able to \"side-step Trump's wrath completely.\" Trump seems willing to threaten tariffs to achieve more than economic policy goals. Sterling falls against the euro after hitting a four-week high of 0.8290 pounds on Monday, according to FactSet. EUR/GBP is last up 0.1% at 0.8319. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0922 ET - The dollar recovers some ground after yesterday's choppy session, which ended with a small decline in the WSJ Dollar Index as tariffs on Mexico and Canada were delayed. The trade war with China goes on and markets remain worried about the potential fallout of a prolonged period in which tariffs would loom over the global economy. BBH says in a report that investors should look through the noise and focus on the fact that the U.S. still has strong growth and elevated inflation, \"and a more hawkish Fed continues to favor higher U.S. yields and a stronger dollar.\" The greenback strengthens 0.3 against the yen and is stable versus the euro. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)</p><p class=\"\">0918 ET - Much of the past few days has been about gauging how inflexible the Trump administration will be on tariffs; in other words, whether they're better understood as firm policy or a negotiating tool. Quick postponements of the Canada and Mexico tariffs point to the latter category, strategist Will Compernolle of FHN Financial writes. He notes China's retaliatory tariffs against the only barriers Trump has actually implemented so far don't start until Feb. 10. That \"implies room for negotiation, something traders may take as a sign these tariffs will not be long term,\" Compernolle writes. \"The trade relationship may nevertheless be scarred, but there's a sense, rightly or wrongly, the more maximalist policies will not be the equilibrium.\" (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)</p><p class=\"\">0835 ET - Treasury yields rise as the U.S. trade war against Mexico and Canada takes a pause while China announces retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports. Inflation concerns are rising while it remains to be seen how the Fed will react to trade tensions. December JOLTS report is due at 10 a.m. ET. ADP employment data will come tomorrow, followed by jobless claims on Thursday and nonfarm payrolls Friday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast a slowdown in job creation last month, with unemployment stable at 4.1%. The 10-year is at 4.577% and the two-year at 4.257%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)</p><p class=\"\">0722 ET - The U.K. might have to pick a side between the U.S. and Europe in a trade conflict even if it avoids direct U.S. tariffs, Pantheon Macroeconomics economists say in a note. \"The EU has reportedly prepared retaliation should President Trump apply tariffs to the eurozone, and we doubt the U.K. could stand neutral in the middle,\" they say. Britain is highly exposed to global trade disruption because total exports and imports are worth 64% of GDP, the economists say. The U.K. might need to take Trump's other threats, including tax cuts and deportations that threaten to raise global inflation, more seriously given that other countries could respond with fiscal stimulus. Trump's actions would be hawkish for U.K. policy, they say. (edward.frankl@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0631 ET - Gold futures slip, though they remain close to all-time highs reached in Monday's session. Futures are down 0.55% at $2,841.40 a troy ounce, after hitting a record $2,872 in the prior session. Gold spot prices are flat on $2,814.43 an ounce. The precious metal is holding close to highs as the U.S. dollar weakens, ActivTrades' Ricardo Evangelista says in a note. The greenback gave up gains after the Trump administration delayed higher tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a month. That said, Washington hasn't backed down on tariffs for Chinese imports. As Beijing retaliates, the threat of an all-out trade war escalates, Evangelista says. This scenario casts a dark shadow over global economic growth prospects, naturally driving increased safe-haven demand and creating scope for further gold gains, Evangelista writes.

The French advertising group ended the year with strong momentum in the fourth quarter, when organic net revenue growth of 6.3% beat expectations. \"[Publicis] is targeting 4%-5% of organic growth in net revenue for 2025, similar to its guidance for 2024.

Research firm DesRosiers Automotive Consultants says its data indicate vehicle sales in January rose 3.1% from the same year-ago month, and in terms of volumes matching the best January ever recorded, back in 2018. On a seasonally-adjusted basis, light-vehicle sales came at a \"strapping\" 2.15 million, DesRosiers says. The firm adds it's difficult to put January's performance in context, given Trump's tariff threat.

The association, which represents about 100,000 members, said that as both countries catch their breath Canada still needs to focus on critical changes needed to prepare for the future. This, the federation suggests, means taking the opportunity now to bring in policies that improve the investment climate, reduce taxes, slash red tape and break down internal trade barriers in the country to ensure Canada is prepared no matter what external threats come its way.

The industry body notes bilateral automotive trade is balanced, with Canadian exports to the U.S. at C$82 billion and imports at C$79 billion in 2023. And it stresses Canadian-made vehicles don't pose a threat to U.S. automotive jobs or production mandates: fewer than 10% of vehicles sold in the U.S. are produced in Canada, whereas the U.S. assembles about half of the vehicles sold in Canada and exports more vehicles to Canada than to any other country.

(paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)</p><p class=\"\">0918 ET - Much of the past few days has been about gauging how inflexible the Trump administration will be on tariffs; in other words, whether they're better understood as firm policy or a negotiating tool. Quick postponements of the Canada and Mexico tariffs point to the latter category, strategist Will Compernolle of FHN Financial writes. He notes China's retaliatory tariffs against the only barriers Trump has actually implemented so far don't start until Feb. 10. That \"implies room for negotiation, something traders may take as a sign these tariffs will not be long term,\" Compernolle writes. \"The trade relationship may nevertheless be scarred, but there's a sense, rightly or wrongly, the more maximalist policies will not be the equilibrium.\" (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)</p><p class=\"\">0910 ET - Oil futures are lower as China retaliates against U.S. tariffs with duties on U.S. exports including oil and LNG, to take effect Feb. 10. The tariff is particularly negative for WTI, says TP ICAP's Scott Shelton in a note. \"I would assume with a $7 tax roughly, that arb is firmly shut and WTI will have to go elsewhere in the next few months as we go into turnarounds.\" U.S. refineries reduce their crude use during the maintenance season, leading to builds in U.S. crude stocks. WTI is down 2.7% at $71.16 a barrel. Brent is 1.8% lower at $74.61 a barrel. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0853 ET - ADM falls 2% premarket after saying it expects an uncertain 2025 and posts a 6% decline in sales for the quarter ending Dec. 31 compared with a year ago, and below analyst estimates. ADM says operating profit at its crushing subsegment, which turns oilseeds into oils and biofuels, was 46% lower versus the prior year quarter, because of higher manufacturing costs among other issues. \"With softer market conditions and policy uncertainty around the world going into 2025, we are focused on improving our operational performance, accelerating costs savings, and simplifying our portfolio,\" says ADM CEO Juan Luciano in a statement. (patrick.thomas@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0840 ET - TGI Fridays has sold more of the 39 company restaurants it declared bankruptcy on last year. The casual-dining chain sold 16 locations to franchisee Yadav Enterprises for $3 million in debt, along with curing costs, according to a court filing. Sugarloaf Hospitality, a current franchisee who is also managing the chain's hundreds of franchised locations, picked up three others. (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)</p><p class=\"\">0835 ET - Treasury yields rise as the U.S. trade war against Mexico and Canada takes a pause while China announces retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports. Inflation concerns are rising while it remains to be seen how the Fed will react to trade tensions. December JOLTS report is due at 10 a.m. ET. ADP employment data will come tomorrow, followed by jobless claims on Thursday and nonfarm payrolls Friday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast a slowdown in job creation last month, with unemployment stable at 4.1%. The 10-year is at 4.577% and the two-year at 4.257%.

Both forecasts came in below the average analyst expectation for revenue of $67.07 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $9.13.</p><p class=\"\">Merck's guidance was affected because it decided to pause shipments of Gardasil to China from February through at least the middle of the year, as the company's Gardasil business in China remains a challenge.</p><p class=\"\">Gardasil prevents cancers caused from the human papillomavirus and is the company's biggest-selling franchise behind blockbuster cancer therapy Keytruda.</p><p class=\"\">The vaccine's sales had been booming in China until last year when Merck said it had been affected by various economic issues, including an anticorruption effort by the government.

Fourth-quarter sales were about $1.6 billion, down 18% from a year ago in part because of the lower demand in China.</p><p class=\"\">Gardasil's China sales account for most of the shot's international revenue.

Analysts expected $15.5 billion.
