Organic revenue was higher than anticipated, which was a nice surprise, but operating profitability fell short of expectations, even as it improved sequentially due to the company's cost-cutting efforts and improving supply-chain expenses, Hersi says. The tool market is still choppy and do-it-yourself work remains weak, while professional demand is solid, the analyst says. He expects mixed demand across the company's markets to persist near-term, though tools volume should keep recovering this year. Shares fall 2% to $84.97.

Overall, PayPal appears to be under more solid footing under the new management team, the analysts add, noting that they expect slightly more favorable risk-reward in the near-term.

The snack maker's 2025 outlook was more disappointing than expected, with adjusted earnings per share set to fall 10%. Underlying sales growth remains solid across regions, despite cocoa prices pulling down operating income across the globe by 28%. Mondelez said in an earnings call it plans to raise prices, but low-cost distribution will be especially crucial for emerging international markets as the company generates about 70% of its sales outside of North America, Quatrochi says.

If chocolate costs remain high, Mondelez plans to gradually increase prices in the second half of this year, especially in developed markets, but the company said consumer confidence is still rocky, which could pose challenges to its pricing plan. Chief financial officer Luca Zaramella said he expects earnings per share to grow again in 2026, either from price increases or cocoa costs normalizing.

LiveWire sold 612 bikes in 2024, far below its expectation of up to 1,500 bikes, and lost $110 million. Its CEO, Karim Donnez, says the company is cutting costs and hopes to succeed in Europe with a new \"maxi-scooter.\" Harley owns nearly 90% of LiveWire, and some analysts say the spinoff's losses are dragging down Harley's financial results.

With Platform9, migrations can happen in weeks to months and at one-tenth of the cost.</p><p class=\"\">“A Fortune 500 enterprise has contracted with Platform9 to migrate 40,000 VMs at $35 per VM to Platform’s Private Cloud Director and this customer will be migrating more than 200 VMs per day using vJailbreak by next month. This customer evaluated multiple alternatives, including Nutanix, Hyper-V, Proxmox and Red Hat, and chose Private Cloud Director because it is the only solution that that provided all the enterprise-ready virtualization features they needed while integrating seamlessly with their existing third-party storage,” said Madhura Maskasky, co-founder and VP of product at Platform9. Maskasky helped develop VMware vCloud Director, VMware’s original private cloud offering used by the world’s largest enterprises that is now a precursor to Broadcom’s VMware Cloud Foundation.</p><p class=\"\">“Platform9 is unique because of the flexibility it provides by offering a best-of-breed virtualization platform, automated VM migration tooling and built-in Kubernetes management capabilities that enable our longer term vision of cloud-native apps,” said Justin Kuss, VP of IT at Rackspace, who is modernizing a VMware based environment.</p><p class=\"\">vJailbreak is the only solution that orchestrates all the aspects of migration – reducing risk and manual labor and increasing customer confidence.

PLEASE REFER TO IMPORTANT INFORMATION AT THE END OF THE PRESS RELEASE.</p><p class=\"\">Teneo AI AB (“Teneo.ai” or the “Company”) has appointed Pareto Securities AB (“Pareto Securities”) to explore the conditions for carrying out a directed share issue of approximately SEK 50 million to Swedish and international institutional investors (the “Directed Share Issue”). The Board of Directors may, subject to the successful completion of the Directed Share Issue and subject to an extraordinary general meeting authorizing the Board of Directors to resolve on issue of new shares, resolve on a share issue at a subscription price corresponding to the subscription price in the Directed Share Issue with preferential rights for existing shareholders (the “Repair Issue”). </p><p class=\"\">The Directed Share Issue is intended to be carried out with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights partly pursuant to the authorization granted to the Board of Directors by the annual general meeting on 26 June 2024. Therefore, the Directed Share Issue is divided into two separate tranches. The first tranche will consist of up to 74,628,848 shares that may be issued within the authorization resolved by the annual general meeting on 26 June 2024 (\"<strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Tranche 1</strong>\"). The second tranche will be issued to pre-agreed investors (\"<strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Tranche 2</strong>\"). Tranche 2 is subject to approval from a subsequent extraordinary general meeting (the \"<strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">EGM</strong>\"). The completion of Tranche 1 is not conditional upon the completion of Tranche 2 and settlement for Tranche 1 is expected to take place on or about 10 February 2025 on a delivery versus payment basis.</p><p class=\"\">The subscription price for the shares in the Directed Share Issue and the total number of new shares will be determined through an accelerated book building procedure which will begin immediately after publication of this press release and end before the commencement of trading on Nasdaq First North Growth Market on 6 February 2025. The book building procedure may, at the discretion of the Company in consultation with Pareto Securities, close earlier or later and may be cancelled at any time. The Company will announce the result of the Directed Share Issue through a press release after the book building procedure is completed. </p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Background and rationale</strong></p><p class=\"\">The Board of Directors of Teneo.ai assesses that the existing working capital is not sufficient to meet the strong and growing demand during the next twelve months. Furthermore the Company will secure the existing cash covenant under its loan agreement with Capital Four. The Company is experiencing strong demand for its solutions and sees an opportunity to accelerate growth. In light of this, the Board of Directors has decided to evaluate the possibility of raising capital through the Directed Share Issue to address the capital need and enable the Company to effectively deliver on the increased demand.</p><p class=\"\">The net proceeds from the Directed Share Issue are intended to be used primarily for investments in sales and marketing in the US, focusing on the Genesys and AWS ecosystems, and secondarily in the UK and Northern Europe. The investments will focus on hiring staff and running marketing activities and campaigns to support the go-to-market strategy. To facilitate integration for players within the Genesys and AWS ecosystems, the net proceeds will also be used to further develop the Teneo platform with customized plug-ins. Finally, the net proceeds will be used to cover ongoing operational costs until the Company achieves self-financing.</p><p class=\"\">The Board of Directors has made an overall assessment and carefully considered the possibility to raise capital through a new share issue with preferential rights for the Company's shareholders instead and has made the assessment that it currently, for several reasons, is more advantageous for the Company and the shareholders to raise capital through a directed share issue. A rights issue would take significantly longer time, which could impair the Company's financial flexibility and entail an exposure to market volatility and risk reducing the ability to raise capital. The Company further assesses that a rights issue, under current market conditions, would entail higher costs related to considerations to potential guarantee undertakings. In addition, a directed share issue provides the opportunity to further diversify and strengthen the Company's shareholder base with institutional investors in order to increase the liquidity of the Company's shares, and the execution of a directed share issue can take place at a lower cost and with less complexity than a rights issue. In the current volatile market environment - which may entail that the conditions for capital raises can change rapidly - the Company deems it prudent to act on the prevailing opportunity and to raise further capital from reputable institutional and professional investors. Considering the above, the Board of Directors has made the assessment that a directed issue of shares with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is the most favorable alternative for the Company, and thus that it is in the shareholders' interest to carry out the Directed Share Issue.</p><p class=\"\">Since the subscription price in the Directed Share Issue will be determined through a book building procedure, it is the Board of Directors' assessment that the subscription price will be on market terms as it reflects prevailing market conditions and investor demand.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Extraordinary general meeting and potential repair issue</strong></p><p class=\"\">Provided that the Board of Directors resolves on the Directed Share Issue, the Board of Directors will summon to the EGM to approve Tranche 2, which is not based on the authorization of the annual general meeting, and to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on the potential Repair Issue. The notice to the EGM is expected to be published shortly after the announcement of the result of the accelerated book building procedure.</p><p class=\"\">Subject to the successful completion of the Directed Share Issue, the Board of Directors may resolve on the Repair Issue at a subscription price corresponding to the subscription price in the Directed Share Issue, provided that the EGM authorizes the Board of Directors to resolve on the potential Repair Issue. Investors participating in the Directed Share Issue will, however, be required to undertake not to participate in the potential Repair Issue, and not to exercise or transfer any subscription rights obtained in the potential Repair Issue. New investors will be able to apply for subscription of shares in the potential Repair Issue without preferential right. No prospectus will be prepared in connection with the Repair Issue. The Company will prepare and publish a disclosure document in the form prescribed by Regulation (EU) 2024/2809 Annex IX for the Repair Issue.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Lock-up</strong></p><p class=\"\">In connection with the Directed Share Issue, the Company has undertaken, subject to customary exceptions, not to issue additional shares for a period of six months after the announcement of the outcome of the Directed Share Issue (the \"<strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Lock-Up</strong>\"). However, the potential Repair Issue and any rights issue carried out by the Company following completion of the Directed Share Issue if the Repair Issue is not completed, is not covered by the Lock-Up. Provided that the Directed Share Issue is completed, shareholding board members and shareholding members of the management team, including the Company's CEO Per Ottosson and the Company's CFO Fredrik Törgren will undertake, subject to customary exceptions and provided that the Directed Issue is carried out, not to sell any securities in Teneo.ai for a period of 90 calendar days after the announcement of the outcome of the Directed Share Issue.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Advisers</strong></p><p class=\"\">Pareto Securities is Sole Manager and Bookrunner, Advokatfirman Schjødt is legal adviser to the Company and Advokatfirman Lindahl is legal adviser to Pareto Securities in connection with the Directed Share Issue.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">For further information, contact</strong></p><p class=\"\">Per Ottosson, CEO, Teneo.ai</p><p class=\"\">E-mail: per.ottosson@teneo.ai</p><p class=\"\">This information is such that Teneo AI AB is obliged to disclose pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">NEW YORK, Feb.  05, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Bikky, a customer data platform built exclusively for multi-unit restaurants, announced a partnership with City BBQ, an award-winning fast-casual brand that’s smoking and serving up tastes of the nation.</p><p class=\"\">Founded in 1999 in Columbus OH, City BBQ has found steady success showcasing the breadth and depth of BBQ found across the country. The brand has been recognized by everyone from the Kansas City BBQ Association to Men’s Journal for their outstanding cuisine, most recently winning Nation’s Restaurant News Barbeque Showdown.</p><p class=\"\">With ambitious plans to expand nationwide—something few BBQ chains have done before—City BBQ wanted rich guest insights to guide their growth and ensure a best-in-class experience. Having worked with a restaurant CDP in a previous role, City BBQ’s Chief Brand Officer, Annica Conrad, directed the team to Bikky.</p><p class=\"\">“I knew Bikky would be instrumental in helping us achieve our goals,” said Conrad. “Their robust data brings a whole new level of sophistication to our marketing, menu, and operations.”</p><p class=\"\">With this partnership, City BBQ can track and analyze the long-term behavior of their guests, empowering the brand to measure promotions, campaigns, and menu changes with precision. The team recently used Bikky to gauge the impact of a month-long acquisition campaign in honor of their 25th anniversary. They offered every member in their loyalty program, and anyone who joined within the month, a 25 cent pulled pork sandwich.</p><p class=\"\">While redemption was extremely high, the brand wondered if new members were simply one-time value seekers or if they would return. Data from Bikky revealed a significantly higher return rate among new members compared to general visitors. “Before Bikky the promotion would have been a one and done because we had no way to understand the long-term impact or if it was worth repeating,” said Conrad. “With Bikky, we know for certain that it was an effective acquisition offer and we’ll likely run it again in the future.”</p><p class=\"\">City BBQ also finds tremendous value in Bikky’s segmentation capabilities, which allow for highly targeted communication and engagement. The team is now segmenting guests by location to benchmark return rates and menu preferences at each of their restaurants, and have experimented with personalized ads featuring guests’ most frequent orders. “We tested serving guests ads that feature their favorite products, and we’ve seen much better return rates on those particular ads.”</p><p class=\"\">Outside of marketing, Bikky is helping the brand optimize their menu and operations based on guest preferences. City BBQ had always known that their macaroni and cheese was a top-selling product, but Bikky’s insights showed that it’s the most popular item among new guests. “We didn’t realize how many new guests ate mac and cheese,” said Conrad. “Now we’re working hard to optimize that product because if it’s the first thing a new guest eats, it has to be the best it can be.” The team is keeping a close eye on which menu items rise to the top and which drive repeat visits so they're always on top of guests’ needs.</p><p class=\"\">Like many brands, City BBQ’s primary focus for 2025 is increasing traffic. They’re certain Bikky’s guest insights give them a serious advantage as they scale. “With Bikky we’re continually refining our loyalty program so it continues to grow traffic,” said Conrad. “We believe that understanding the behavior of new guests and increasing personalization through segmentation is the best way to deliver on our goals.”</p><p class=\"\">“We’re excited to support City BBQ as they scale to become the premier BBQ-focused fast casual brand in the nation,” says Abhinav Kapur, co-founder and CEO of Bikky. “They’re a clear leader in their category, and now at the forefront of how restaurant brands use customer data to grow traffic, frequency, and sales.”</p><p class=\"\">The fastest-growing, most innovative restaurants in today’s competitive market look to Bikky for insight into how their decisions impact key metrics like frequency and traffic. City BBQ joins a growing roster of brands, including Robeks, WaBa Grill, and Dave’s Hot Chicken, which rely on Bikky’s groundbreaking guest data and analytics platform.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About City BBQ</strong></p><p class=\"\">City Barbeque has been proudly serving the flavor of America since opening its first joint in 1999 and has consistently been recognized as a top BBQ spot, most recently winning the Nation’s Restaurant News BBQ Showdown. The company is also celebrated as an outstanding employer and community partner, hosting thousands of fundraisers for local charities and nonprofits. Today, teams at more than 70 locations smoke meats on site over local hickory wood and prepare homemade sides and desserts fresh every day. The growing fast-casual brand operates in ten states and counting, serving the city's best barbeque for dine-in, carryout, delivery, and catering.</p><p class=\"\">For more information, visit City Barbeque at www.citybbq.com</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Bikky</strong></p><p class=\"\">Bikky is a customer data platform exclusively for multi-unit restaurant brands.</p><p class=\"\">With Bikky, brands like Dave's Hot Chicken, Bojangles, and Robeks clearly understand how their marketing, menu, and operations impact guest traffic and frequency.
