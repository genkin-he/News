The FTSE 100 company said its energy segment's performance remains robust despite warm weather, the analyst adds, noting that the healthcare unit's profit was flat while profit declined in technology. RBC expects a positive topline performance in the short term, along with the disposal of healthcare forecast in the next six months and further delivery of its energy strategy--including acquisitions--, Brooke says. \"Whilst energy standalone is tough to value, the division is cleaner, has positive mix drivers, is higher return and has more favorable working capital dynamics,\" he adds.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span>Aqilion<p class=\"\">AQILION AB (publ) announces that the Company has resumed development of the its TAK1 program as the company has <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"> </strong>regained the control and ownership of the program. After reviewing and analysing the complete data package, Aqilion decided to recommence the development of the program. The TAK1 mechanism is a key regulator of inflammation and the objective is to develope a new treatment for severe diseases caused by chronic inflammation and dysfunctional immune reactions.</p><p class=\"\">The TAK1 mechanism is a central biological switch for several central inflammatory processes. By dampening its activity, there is potential to block and delay progression in severe and chronic diseases. The target has been identified as a key mechanism by academia and industry, and there is widespread interest in its potential in a number of indications.</p><p class=\"\">Aqilion's internal drug development has led to unique small molecule inhibitors and the collaboration with Merck KGaA further added new molecular assets. The new project strategy for the TAK1 program is based on proprietary data in combination with data and knowledge generated in collaboration with Merck KGaA during 2023 -2024.</p><p class=\"\">Sarah Fredriksson, CEO of Aqilion, comments:</p><p class=\"\">“We are pleased and excited to continue our preclinical TAK1 program, since it is a highly interesting drug target in several chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases. The analysis of all data, generated internally and externally, encouraged us to resume the development. We are looking forward to presenting the program during partnering meetings later this year.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About TAK1</strong></p><p class=\"\">TAK1 (Transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1) is a ”master regulator” of both     NF-κB and JNK signaling. It is a key kinase in innate immunity that integrates and controls signaling and production of key pathological cytokines. TAK1 integrates clinically and genetically validated pathways in human disease. Aqilion has discovered highly selective and potent TAK1 inhibitors with excellent drug-like properties within a unique chemical space.</p><p class=\"\">Kinases are a very succesful drug target class. Immune kinases including, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2 and BTK have shown clinical effects in many autoimmune and and inflammatory diseases. However, innate immunity kinase targets that are hypothesized to affect e.g. NF-kB or JNK signaling have failed to provide sufficient or sustained efficacy. These include p38⍺, SYK, TPL2 and IRAK4. Due to the central upstream node function of TAK1, inhibiting this kinase has the potential to provide a higher degree of efficacy by modulating the key cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF⍺.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About the collaboration with Merck KGaA</strong></p><p class=\"\">The TAK1 program began in the fall of 2019 and in early 2023, Aqilion signed a pre-clinical licensing- and collaboration deal with Merck KGaA Darmstadt, Germany (10 M€ upfront and 950 M€ in potential milestones) to discover, develop and commercialize small-molecule inhibitors of TAK1. June 20, 2024 Aqilion announced that Aqilion and Merck have decided to terminate the joint development of the TAK1 program. Data generated in the course of the collaboration have altered the risk-benefit profile within the intended indications. Merck has returned all rights according to the licensing and collaboration agreement.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">For further information, please contact:</strong></p><p class=\"\">Sarah Fredriksson, CEO, AQILION AB, + 46 (0)70 261 4575, sarah.fredriksson@aqilion.com</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Aqilion</strong></p><p class=\"\">Aqilion is a biotech company that focuses on developing innovative new treatments for diseases caused by chronic inflammation and dysfunctional immune reactions such as autoimmune diseases.</p><p class=\"\">We identify innovative ideas that could potentially lead to new medications and refine them into commercially interesting projects.
