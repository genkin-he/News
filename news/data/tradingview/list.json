Lerner said they expect the U.S. economy to stay resilient in 2025, given how it weathered the pandemic, high inflation and the fastest Fed rate-hiking cycle in decades.

The U.S. bank forecasts organic sales growth for the fourth quarter at 1.8%, driven by a price contribution of 1.6% and a sales volume contribution of 0.2%. This result compared with a market consensus of 1.1%. For the year, the Danish brewer is expected to report organic EBIT growth of 5.8%, consistent with 3Q results and in line with the guided range of between 4%-6%. Looking ahead, the company is expected to issue EBIT growth guidance of 1% to 5%, dragged by the loss of the San Miguel brand's license in the U.K., the analysts say. However, they say that the stock has performed well so far this year, and the valuation remains attractive. Shares are down 0.8% at 742 Danish kronor. (michael.susin@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
