The deal, unveiled last month, is part of Apollo's effort to expand its investments in assets and businesses across various fast-growing industries.</p><p class=\"\">\"This is not just about [artificial intelligence] and DeepSeek,\" Rowan said. \"This is about fundamental investments in energy, in infrastructure, in power, in data, in next-generation manufacturing and a host of other things that are going to be needed [and] financed.\"</p><p class=\"\">Rowan added that projects in those industries are typically \"long dated and complex,\" making them less suitable for traditional bank financing and creating opportunities for private-credit firms.</p><p class=\"\">Apollo's record origination, a metric that reflects new investments, last year was more than double the $97 billion invested in 2023, according to a presentation of the results. Apollo originated $61 billion during last year's fourth quarter alone, its second highest quarterly total to date, according to Rowan.</p><p class=\"\">The firm's funds brought in $152 billion in fresh capital last year, slightly less than $157 billion in 2023. That helped lift its total assets under management by about 15%, to $751 billion at the end of December, $616 billion of which in credit strategies, the presentation showed.</p><p class=\"\">Apollo's asset management business accounted for about $81 billion of last year's capital inflows, while the firm's insurer Athene represented $71 billion, James Zelter, Apollo's president, said during Tuesday's earnings call.</p><p class=\"\">\"In short, both sides of the house produced.\" Zelter said. \"Alongside origination, capital formation is the lifeblood of our continued growth.\"</p><p class=\"\">Apollo  recently promoted Zelter to president of the holding company that also includes Athene, while former head of credit John Zito took his place as co-president of the firm's asset-management arm alongside Scott Kleinman. The promotions have been seen as an effort to clarify possible successors to Rowan.</p><p class=\"\">Apollo plans to expand its investments across strategies such as asset-backed financing and direct lending, including to large businesses whose capital needs are too</p><p class=\"\">big to be met in public-debt markets alone, Zelter said. As examples, he cited the joint venture that Apollo formed last year with chip maker Intel, which involved an $11 billion investment, and the $700 million financing it led for music company Sony Music Group.</p><p class=\"\">Zelter added that Apollo is also looking to back companies that private-equity firms are having difficulty selling or otherwise exiting through an initial public offering.</p><p class=\"\">\"When you think about the overhang from PE sponsors, when you think about the other challenges right now in monetization of the IPO market, certainly I think you're going to see a much, much greater volume of opportunity in the U.S. and in Europe and parts of Asia,\" he said.</p><p class=\"\">Apollo posted earnings of $1.49 billion, or $2.39 a share, down from $2.76 billion, or $4.44 a share, a year earlier.</p><p class=\"\">On an adjusted basis, Apollo posted earnings of $1.36 billion, or $2.22 a share, a quarterly record, beating the average analyst peg of $1.85 a share, as per FactSet.</p><p class=\"\">Apollo declared a dividend of 46.25 cents a per share, payable Feb. 28 to holders of record at the close of business on Feb. 18.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Luis Garcia at luis.garcia@wsj.com and Rob Curran at rob.curran@wsj.com</p></span></div>",

Those values are seemingly at odds with those of Trump Media's majority shareholder, President Donald Trump, who has made quashing diversity, equity, and inclusion an objective of his administration.</p><p class=\"\">Neither Moov nor Trump Media immediately responded to requests for comment. In a statement Monday, Moov CEO Wade Arnold praised Trump Media for \"building a dynamic platform for free expression.\"</p><p class=\"\">On Monday, Trump Media said it had signed an agreement with Moov to handle payment processing for its Truth Social platform and video streaming service Truth+. The company's Truth. Fi fintech services brand, which is expected to roll out later this year, will also use Moov's secure payment processing, Trump Media said.</p><p class=\"\">Moov, founded in 2017 as an open-source fintech platform, is also the organizer of fintech_devcon, an annual developer conference. In 2021, Moov unveiled a \"diversity scholarship\" that would allow recipients from \"underrepresented communities\" to attend the first of those conferences.</p><p class=\"\">According to a profile on Built In, a tech-oriented job board, Moov boasts a \"dedicated diversity and inclusion staff\" as well as an equal-pay policy and required unconscious-bias training. The same profile mentions \"hiring practices that promote diversity,\" including partnerships with \"diversity-focused communities and recruiting platforms.\"</p><p class=\"\">All that contrasts with actions taken by Trump, the majority owner of Trump Media Group, since he was sworn into office on Jan. 20.</p><p class=\"\">On Jan. 22, Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to \"end illegal DEI\" and terminate so-called DEI discrimination in the federal workforce. The mandate revoked Executive Order 11246, which was signed by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965 to establish requirements for nondiscriminatory hiring practices for government contractors.</p><p class=\"\">In an order issued Jan. 27, Trump eliminated DEI offices and policies within the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security, claiming \"the Armed Forces have been afflicted with radical gender ideology.\"</p><p class=\"\">The president also appeared to blame diversity initiatives at the Federal Aviation Administration for the midair collision that killed 67 people in Washington, D.C., last week. During a press conference on Jan. 30, Trump claimed, without evidence, that the Biden administration allowed people with intellectual and psychiatric impairments to work for the FAA.</p><p class=\"\">Trump appeared to walk back his remarks later that day, saying DEI \"may have\" contributed to the crash. But the White House released a memo doubling down on claims that the Biden administration \"egregiously rejected merit-based hiring,\" which led to the FAA recruiting people with \"severe intellectual disabilities.\"</p><p class=\"\">Truth Social positioned itself as an alternative to Twitter and Facebook when it launched in 2022. The platform says it provides a safe harbor from censorship by large tech corporations and that it is free of political discrimination.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Traders and farmers hope that the administration is using tariff threats as leverage in trade negotiations, as opposed to following through with a major disruption to agricultural trade.</p><p class=\"\">\"I think after last time, people learned their lesson,\" said Terry Reilly, head grains and oilseeds analyst with Marex in Chicago. \"I think the trade is well braced for this.\"</p><p class=\"\">Grain futures trading in Chicago settled higher Tuesday, continuing the positive momentum that grain futures have all had since the start of the year, with corn rising 8%, soybeans up 6%, and wheat up 5% since Jan. 1.</p><p class=\"\">The trade war between the U.S. and China that raged during Trump's first term cut into U.S. exports, particularly for soybeans - with export sales of U.S. soybeans to top buyer China falling by over 60% from 2017 to 2019, according to data from the Department of Agriculture.</p><p class=\"\">There were many stops and starts in the negotiations leading to a partial trade deal between the two nations in late 2019, which called for increased purchasing of U.S. exports by China.</p><p class=\"\">This time, traders and analysts appear ready for the potential chaos that may ensue in negotiations between both sides. Grain traders are moving carefully in recent sessions, limiting the amount of fluctuation seen in futures prices.</p><p class=\"\">\"It appears that the trade is reluctant to price in a tariff premium or discount given the speed of developments,\" said Jake Hanley, managing director and senior portfolio specialist with Burlington, Vt.-based Teucrium Trading LLC.</p><p class=\"\">The fluid nature of the news coming out of the White House has traders glued to news coverage and Trump's Truth Social account, where he provided confirmation about Mexican and Canadian tariffs being delayed.</p><p class=\"\">In the case of China, retaliatory tariffs didn't target U.S. agriculture, outside of agricultural equipment coming out of the country. The measure focused on other mostly energy commodities, including oil, gas and coal.</p><p class=\"\">Farmers nationwide have become more positive about their chances to have a profitable year in 2025 and that a trade war can be avoided. In a survey conducted jointly by Purdue University and the CME Group and released this month, a growing percentage of farmers say that they don't believe a new trade war is coming - with 29% of the population calling it 'unlikely' or 'very unlikely', up 8 points from the previous month.</p><p class=\"\">Meanwhile, 40% see a potential trade war as 'likely' or 'very likely', but that's down 8 points from the previous month.</p><p class=\"\">\"Recent improvements in crop and livestock prices have provided a boost to farmers' current sentiment,\" said Michael Langemeier, the principal investigator for the barometer and a professor at Purdue's school for Commercial Agriculture, in the release.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Kirk Maltais at kirk.maltais@wsj.com</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Joy Wiltermuth</p><p class=\"\">It still pays to stick with shorter-term bonds, but concerns about growth are back</p><p class=\"\">President Trump's trade-war tactics have been tough for investors to parse, especially as stocks zigzagged to start the week amid mixed message from the bond market.</p><p class=\"\">Shorter 2-year Treasurys yields BX:TMUBMUSD02Y on Tuesday were near 4.21%, only slightly below their 200-day moving average, according to FactSet data. Longer 10-year yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Ywere closer to 4.51%, far above their average for the same time frame.</p><p class=\"\">Tracking yields over longer stretches can help establish trends. The curious thing, however, is that both of these yields remain comfortably above levels from late August, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the time had come for rate cuts.</p><p class=\"\">It also comes despite warnings from Wall Street last year that investors should lock in yields before rate cuts ruin the opportunity. But the Fed already has cut its short-term policy rate by 1 percentage point since September.</p><p class=\"\">\"There are two narratives the bond market is wrestling with,\" said Lawrence Gillum, chief income strategist at LPL Research, in a phone interview Tuesday.</p><p class=\"\">Yields on Treasurys that mature in two years or less reflect concerns about potential price increases and the Federal Reserve's careful approach to rate cuts, Gillum said.</p><p class=\"\">Yet another recent theme relates to tariffs, and how they tend to increase prices, but also slow economic growth. Gillum expects Trump's tariffs to apply downward pressure on 10-year yields, bringing them down to the low 4% range in the back-end of the year, as investors react to growth concerns.</p><p class=\"\">See: The tariff wars aren't over. China hits back over new 10% tariffs.</p><p class=\"\">How should investors be positioned now? The biggest \"bang for your buck,\" on a yield per duration basis for the Bloomberg Corporate Index, would be to keep exposure in bonds short, according to Gillum.</p><p class=\"\">The chart looks at different bond maturity buckets from the corporate index, helping to measure the sensitivity a bond portfolio may have to rate changes over time.</p><p class=\"\">\"Right now the economy is in good shape, but it probably [won't be] toward the end of the year,\" Gillum told MarketWatch. \"If you are managing a fixed-income portfolio relative to an industry index, and trying to outperform, our advice is stay neutral. Don't take a lot of rate risk, until we see the economic data soften.\"</p><p class=\"\">Meanwhile, \"there's a lot of value in the front-end,\" Gillum said, adding that it's still possible to collect around 4.5% on shorter-duration bonds, higher than seen much of the past decade.</p><p class=\"\">Trump's start-stop strategy on tariffs adds other risks for investors to consider. BofA analysts estimate that the S&amp;P 500 index SPX could see as much of an 8% hit to earnings per share from 25% tariffs on Mexico and China and 10% incremental tariffs on China.</p><p class=\"\">See: As Trump's tariffs grip markets, a key indicator flashes a warning for bullish investors</p><p class=\"\">Concerns about stocks stumbling from near record highs would bolster the case for owning bonds in a portfolio, but investors also don't want to wait for potentially drastic Fed rate cuts and a faltering economy to add duration.</p><p class=\"\">\"The big takeaway,\" according to Gillum, is that \"volatility in fixed-income isn't going to go away.\"</p><p class=\"\">The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.8% on Tuesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA was 0.4% higher and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP was up 1.2%, according to FactSet.</p><p class=\"\">Related: Stock-market investors are getting nervous about this bond-market move that's only happened twice in over 40 years</p><p class=\"\">-Joy Wiltermuth</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Nonprofit conversions to for-profits have historically been for health care organizations like hospitals, not venture capital-backed companies, she said.</p></span></div>",
