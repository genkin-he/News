            "title": "Old Dominion Freight Line Reports Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial Results",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., a leading North American less-than-truckload (LTL) motor carrier, has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ending December 31, 2024. The company has reported a decline in revenue and earnings per share (EPS) compared to the previous year, reflecting ongoing economic challenges.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Financial Highlights</strong></p> <p class=\"\">For the fourth quarter of 2024, Old Dominion reported:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Total revenue of $1.39 billion, a decrease of 7.3% from $1.50 billion in the same period of 2023.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Net income of $263.1 million, down 18.5% from $322.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.23, a 16.3% decrease from $1.47 in the prior year.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Operating ratio increased to 75.9% from 71.8% in the fourth quarter of 2023.</li></ul><p class=\"\">For the full year 2024, the company reported:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Total revenue of $5.81 billion, a slight decrease of 0.9% from $5.87 billion in 2023.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Net income of $1.19 billion, down 4.3% from $1.24 billion in 2023.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Diluted EPS of $5.48, a 2.7% decrease from $5.63 in the previous year.</li></ul> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Business and Operational Highlights</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Old Dominion's President and CEO, Marty Freeman, noted that the company's financial results were impacted by the softness in the domestic economy. Despite the revenue decline, the company maintained its market share and achieved an on-time service performance of 99% and a cargo claims ratio below 0.1%.</p><p class=\"\">The decrease in revenue was primarily due to an 8.2% decline in LTL tons per day, driven by a 7.6% decrease in LTL shipments per day and a 0.7% decrease in LTL weight per shipment. Excluding fuel surcharges, LTL revenue per hundredweight increased by 3.8%, reflecting the success of the company's long-term yield management strategy.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Old Dominion continued to return capital to shareholders through its share repurchase and dividend programs. In 2024, the company utilized $967.3 million for share repurchases and paid $223.6 million in cash dividends. The Board of Directors declared a first-quarter dividend of $0.28 per share, representing a 7.7% increase compared to the first quarter of 2024.</p><p class=\"\">Capital expenditures for 2024 totaled $771.3 million, with planned expenditures for 2025 expected to be approximately $575 million, including investments in real estate, service center expansion, tractors and trailers, and information technology.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Management's Perspective</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Marty Freeman commented, \"The challenging macroeconomic environment over the past couple of years has created persistent demand headwinds for our business. Nevertheless, our outstanding team has remained focused on executing our proven strategic plan by maximizing our operating efficiencies, maintaining our yield discipline, and investing in our capacity and technology to further improve our service and support future growth.\"</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Future Outlook</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Old Dominion remains confident in its ability to produce profitable growth and increase shareholder value through continued execution of its long-term strategic plan. The company is well-positioned to win market share once a positive inflection in industry demand occurs.</p><p class=\"\">SEC Filing: <a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/878927/000095017025014174/odfl-20250205.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">OLD DOMINION FREIGHT LINE, INC.
