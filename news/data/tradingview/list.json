Just as new U.S. tariffs of 10% on China went into effect, Beijing retaliated. European leaders are prepared for their own fight with Trump over the world's most valuable trading relationship — and they prefer cooperation. And in Washington, Elon Musk's push to dismantle multiple federal agencies has lawmakers and government workers wondering who is really in charge.</p><p class=\"\">Today's Headlines</p><p class=\"\">China hit back against new U.S. tariffs with a series of moves including levies on certain American goods, an antitrust probe into Google and restrictions on Chinese exports of key minerals.</p><p class=\"\">The White House whipsawed over the timing of tariffs and the possibility of carve-outs before striking last-minute deals with Canada and Mexico.</p><p class=\"\">European leaders, bracing for a trade fight with Trump, said they are ready to strike back but prefer cooperation.</p><p class=\"\">As Musk moved with Silicon Valley velocity to shake up Washington, Trump hinted that there are curbs to keep him from doing anything in the government without the White House's blessing.</p><p class=\"\">Secretary of State Marco Rubio said El Salvador offered to accept deportees of any nationality from the U.S., including incarcerated American citizens.</p><p class=\"\">Live From The Markets</p><p class=\"\">Trump's detente with Mexico and Canada validates optimists on Wall Street, but this risks breeding complacency regarding a real trade war, writes Jon Sindreu.</p><p class=\"\">Read It Here First</p><p class=\"\">Amazon, king of online retail, can't seem to make its physical stores work.</p><p class=\"\">The company has shrunk its portfolio of Amazon Go convenience stores by about half since early 2023, and closed dozens of its other branded retail stores in recent years, including bookstores, fashion outlets and its \"4-star\" locations stocked with bestselling items from its website. After a decadelong experiment with bricks-and-mortar stores, Amazon's dominance online has yet to translate into a successful strategy for connecting with shoppers in the real world, Kate King reports.</p><p class=\"\">In 24 hours, one senator flipped from no to a crucial yes on Pete Hegseth.</p><p class=\"\">The night before Sen. Thom Tillis cast the fateful 50th \"yes\" vote to confirm Hegseth as defense secretary, he approached the Senate's new Republican leader and told him he was a \"no.\" That set off a last-minute blitz by the president, the vice president, the Republican whip team and Hegseth himself. Tillis's turnaround left witnesses who came forward as collateral damage, Lindsay Wise, Jack Gillum and Meridith McGraw report.</p><p class=\"\">Expert Take</p><p class=\"\">Q: Is USAID closing?</p><p class=\"\">Rubio notified lawmakers Monday that he intends to work with Congress to reorganize the U.S. Agency for International Development and potentially merge much of it into the State Department. Hours earlier, Musk's Department of Government Efficiency sought to exert control over USAID and shut its headquarters to agency officials. Michael R. Gordon, Ken Thomas and Alexander Ward explain where that leaves the agency.</p><p class=\"\">A: It is unclear how Rubio's promise to work with lawmakers to overhaul USAID would be reconciled with Musk's stated determination to close the agency. In his note to lawmakers, Rubio, who says he is now USAID's acting director, said he asked for a review of the agency's activities and that if some of the agency's bureaus were merged into the State Department, the rest might be abolished.</p><p class=\"\">Trump administration officials have been considering plans to merge the 10,000-person, $40 billion agency into the State Department, which would rein in its autonomy. Democratic lawmakers say that would be illegal without congressional approval, as USAID's existence is in federal statute.</p><p class=\"\">Rubio has already ordered a freeze on most foreign aid as part of a review. He later exempted \"core life saving programs\" that involve medicine, medical services, food and shelter. The immediate fate of other programs, which include those that support economic development, counterterrorist training, counternarcotics cooperation and efforts to strengthen the rule of law abroad, was left unclear.</p><p class=\"\">Meanwhile, two Democratic senators, Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, vowed to place holds on Trump's State Department nominees unless the administration's attack on USAID ends.</p><p class=\"\">See The Story</p><p class=\"\">Trump's tariff idol, William McKinley, abandoned his own tariff policy.</p><p class=\"\">Trump often cites the 25th president, William McKinley, as an inspiration. The \"McKinley Tariffs\" were some of the largest hikes in U.S. history, but in his second term, McKinley changed his mind, and argued for more free trade.</p><p class=\"\">Happening Today</p><p class=\"\">The Labor Department will report on December job openings at 10 a.m. ET.</p><p class=\"\">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet with President Trump.

Most industrial companies that have reported so far beat expectations on orders and revenue. The downturn in manufacturing activity that began in 2022 was just starting to show signs of easing, de-Bray says. However, the uncertainty, extra costs and inflation brought forth by new U.S tariffs could derail this nascent industrial recovery, the analyst says. With the risk of a global recession rising, Swedish SKF and Sandvik are likely first in line to feel the impact. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

Focus now turns to policy execution, with economists watching to see if policymakers can deliver on their aim of supporting growth without sacrificing fiscal prudence or financial stability.</p><p class=\"\">Here's what we watched:</p><p class=\"\">FISCAL FOCUS: The 50.65 trillion rupee budget for the fiscal year starting April, equivalent to $584.22 billion, stuck to its fiscal consolidation guns, despite pressure to do more to lift the economy.</p><p class=\"\">India again cut its fiscal deficit target, lowering it to 4.4% of gross domestic product from an estimated 4.8% for the current fiscal year ending March.</p><p class=\"\">Fiscal prudence prevailed over calls to spur growth, ANZ economists said.</p><p class=\"\">With policymakers continuing to prioritize macroeconomic resilience over short-term spurts of growth, the budget shows continued focus on strengthening public sector balance sheets to \"create a long runway of high and stable growth,\" Goldman Sachs economists Santanu Sengupta, Arjun Varma and Andrew Tilton said.</p><p class=\"\">The budget targets what Nomura economists view as an \"impossible fiscal trinity\" of fiscal discipline, income tax cuts and steady capex outlay. \"Only two can hold.\"</p><p class=\"\">DOWNSIZE DEBT: The budget also laid out a medium-term fiscal strategy to keep central government debt on a downward path to 50% of GDP by FY 2031.</p><p class=\"\">Increased confidence that the government can stick to that framework and keep debt on the decline would be positive for India's sovereign rating over time, said Jeremy Zook, primary sovereign analyst for India at Fitch Ratings. \"Still, the pace of debt reduction is gradual, which leaves open downside risks from a large economic shock.\"</p><p class=\"\">While India is likely to reach its near-term policy goals, Christian de Guzman, senior vice president at Moody's Ratings, doesn't expect the debt burden to improve enough to put its fiscal strength on par with most of its investment-grade peers.</p><p class=\"\">GROWTH DRIVERS: The budget identified four key engines of development: agriculture, micro, small and medium enterprises, private sector investments and exports. Measures included financial assistance for farmers, expanded credit for startups, and job creation for manufacturing.</p><p class=\"\">The budget is largely neutral for economic growth, and is unlikely to deliver any inflationary impulse, according to Nomura economists led by Sonal Varma.</p><p class=\"\">Given the time it will take to see the impact on consumption, OCBC maintains its real GDP growth forecast for FY 2026 at 6.2%.</p><p class=\"\">TAXES: To boost consumption, the budget tabled income tax relief aimed at freeing up spending power but analysts are not fully sold on the efficacy.</p><p class=\"\">The government raised the income tax exemption limit for annual incomes up to INR1.2 million, specifically targeting the middle class. That will result in a revenue loss of about INR1 trillion in direct taxes.</p><p class=\"\">The tax cuts could raise net incomes among India's upper middle class by 2%-7%, analysts at Emkay Global said, but the \"net effect is inconspicuous.\"</p><p class=\"\">ANZ economists expect to see only a mild boost to household consumption, as the direct impacts seem limited to a narrow base. Consumption could have been boosted more widely by reducing indirect taxes on essential goods like fuel, they said.</p><p class=\"\">OCBC economist Lavanya Venkateswaran noted that there are no clear offsets to compensate for the revenue loss and though there is a shift toward greater tax compliance, implementation will be key. Reliance on nontax revenues leaves fiscal consolidation vulnerable given the uncertainty of such sources, while tax revenue assumptions depend on a growth outlook subject to downside risks, she added.</p><p class=\"\">MARKETS: The implications for markets appear largely neutral, with analysts viewing the budget as a tailwind for consumer-facing stocks.</p><p class=\"\">Yuan Yiu Tsai at Eastspring Investments flags urban consumption-related stocks  as budget winners over capex-driven ones as they can benefit from the boost to disposable income. Immediate beneficiaries include auto, hospitality and retail stocks, the portfolio manager said.</p><p class=\"\">Goldman Sachs strategists also favor consumer-retail oriented lenders, banks and financial firms, as well as urban-discretionary consumption categories.</p><p class=\"\">RBI RESCUE? Eyes now turn to the Reserve Bank of India meeting Friday--its first under a new governor. The budget's fiscal consolidation has firmed up expectations that a rate cut is coming after GDP data signaled that India's growth slowed to a four-year low.</p><p class=\"\">With a paring back of the fiscal deficit likely to impart a negative fiscal impulse on the economy, the task of lifting growth likely rests on the RBI, HSBC economists said.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Kimberley Kao and Fabiana Negrin Ochoa</p></span></div>",

Concerns about weak growth and rising unemployment rate are likely to result in faster initial rate reductions, but fears about a rebound in U.K. inflation could then cause the BOE to pause, he says. \"Rising government spending and rate cuts will encourage demand and allow firms to cover higher costs by raising prices.\" Berenberg expects U.K. inflation could reaccelerate to 3.0% in 2025. U.K. money markets price in three rate cuts this year, though a second reduction isn't fully priced in until June. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

The company reported strong financial performance, driven by robust sales volume growth and strategic reorganization efforts.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Financial Highlights</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Ingredion's full-year 2024 reported and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were $9.71 and $10.65, respectively, compared to $9.60 and $9.42 in 2023. The company generated $1,436 million in cash from operations, benefiting from a $400 million favorable change in working capital balances as corn costs decreased. Additionally, Ingredion returned $426 million to shareholders, including $216 million in share repurchases.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Business and Operational Highlights</strong></p> <p class=\"\">The company saw record fourth-quarter financial results, with significant contributions from the Texture and Healthful Solutions (T&amp;HS) segment and the Food and Industrial Ingredients (F&amp;II) segments in the US/CAN and LATAM regions. The T&amp;HS segment experienced double-digit sales volume growth, while the F&amp;II US/CAN segment benefited from multi-year customer contract renewals, leading to substantial operating income growth.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Ingredion's strategic initiatives included a $100 million investment in its Indianapolis facility to enhance reliability and operating efficiency. The company also completed the sale of its South Korea business, which impacted net sales and operating income. Despite these changes, Ingredion managed to achieve significant cost savings through its Cost2Compete program.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Management's Perspective</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Jim Zallie, president and CEO of Ingredion, highlighted the company's record Q4 financial results and the successful reorganization efforts that positioned the company for future growth. Zallie emphasized the importance of customer collaboration and operational excellence in driving the company's performance.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Future Outlook</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Looking ahead to 2025, Ingredion expects reported and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $10.75 to $11.55. The company anticipates low single-digit growth in net sales, driven by greater volume demand, partially offset by price mix and foreign exchange impacts. Operating income is expected to increase by mid-single digits, with specific growth projections for the T&amp;HS and F&amp;II LATAM segments.</p><p class=\"\">SEC Filing: <a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046257/000104625725000007/ingr-20250204.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Ingredion Inc [ INGR ] - 8-K - Feb. 04, 2025</a></p></span></div>",

Earnings per share for the nine months ended December 31, 2024 were $1.32, compared to $1.09 during the nine months ended December 31, 2023.

Due to the depth and strength of the IT team, system updates, and new features are released weekly, which enables rapid progress on enhancements and advancements in automation and innovation. In the December quarter, generative-AI-based functionality was released to streamline document processing and identify claim milestones, and improvements are planned to enhance the integrated communication platform. These enhancements can optimize outcomes, improve the experience of injured workers, and make day-to-day tasks easier, which allows CorVel professionals to focus on higher-level activities.</p><p class=\"\">During the quarter in the healthcare market, the persistent upward trend of medical costs is causing Administrative Services Only, ASO, customers to seek additional medical savings and greater cost efficiency in claims. CERIS is ideally equipped to solve the growing demand by offering multiple audits and lowering claim thresholds. With substantial expertise in prepay, CERIS is able to accommodate ASOs and Payers with the tools needed to reduce medical spend without additional administrative overhead.</p><p class=\"\">Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 </p><p class=\"\">All statements included in this press release, other than statements or characterizations of historical fact, are forward-looking statements.
