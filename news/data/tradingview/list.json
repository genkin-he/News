The process poses a significant challenge, given that in 2024, an estimated 4 million daily packages arrived in the U.S. under the de minimis rule, which allows low-value shipments to bypass duties and custom scrutiny, Tam says. The Trump administration revoked this exemption for China as part of broader tariff measures. Among Chinese e-commerce players, PDD Holdings will be hurt as its overseas e-commerce platform Temu has a significant exposure in the U.S., the analyst notes. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

That is higher than its ROE of 7.2% in FY 2024. Analyst Mohd Shanaz Noor Azam says the Malaysian conglomerate could optimize working capital, streamline its portfolio and improve cost efficiencies to help it reach the target. Its industrial division is well-positioned to benefit from the global energy transition and steady demand for rental and after-sales services, contributing to long-term growth, he adds. The stock remains attractive, with projected dividend yields of 6.9% in 2025 and 7.3% in 2026. CIMB maintains a buy rating and a target price of MYR3.00 on Sime Darby. Shares are 1.8% higher at MYR2.22. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0259 GMT - Iron ore falls in the morning Asian session, dragged by concerns over the tariffs China announced Tuesday. China imposed a 15% tariff on imports of U.S. coking coal, ANZ Research analysts say in a research report. Chinese iron-ore markets will probably come under pressure amid worries about weaker export-driven demand, the analysts add. Coking coal along with iron ore are raw materials used in steel production. All of the iron-ore contracts on the Dalian Commodity Exchange are lower, with the May 2025 contract last quoted 1.2% down at CNY799.5 a ton. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0245 GMT - Palm oil prices rise in early Asian trading, supported by a bullish technical outlook, AmInvestment Bank says in a note. The bank suggests traders to consider long positions if prices adjust. Meanwhile, Malaysia's palm oil production is expected to remain weak due to heavy rainfall. January output is estimated to have declined 10% from the previous month to 1.34 million tons, marking a fifth consecutive decline, according to a Bloomberg survey. Inventories may have dropped 2.9% to 1.66 million tons, while exports likely slumped 14.2% to 1.15 million tons, the survey shows. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board will release official data on Monday. AmInvestment Bank pegs CPO support at 4,251 ringgit/ton and resistance at 4,453 ringgit/ton. The Bursa Malaysia Derivatives contract for April delivery is 23 ringgit higher at 4,331 ringgit/ton.

The government recently proposed a fixed 2% mandatory employees provident fund contribution, down from the initial 12% proposed last year, though the implementation date has yet to be set, they note. This should be a relief for planters, especially following the higher minimum wage policy introduced in February, they say. While these moves may have a slight negative impact on earnings amid higher costs, it is expected to be minimal, they add. RHB maintains an overweight rating on the Southeast Asian plantation sector, pegging Johor Plantations, Sarawak Oil Palms, Bumitama Agri, London Sumatra Indonesia and SD Guthrie as top picks.

The three-month LME copper contract is up 0.5% at $9,193.00/ton, nickel is up 0.7% and zinc is 0.3% higher. China on Tuesday announced export restrictions on metals for various industries in retaliation to U.S. tariffs, but the list didn't include base metals, which supports the positive sentiment, Daria Efanova, head of research at Sucden Financial writes in a note. Given the moderate tariff increases from China and the U.S., markets are weighing the potential impact on both economies, which may be minimal provided that the situation doesn't escalate further, Efanova adds. (kimberley.kao@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0047 GMT - Gold edges higher in early Asian trade. Demand for haven assets like gold, which is testing record highs, is being boosted by uncertainty in a challenging global economic environment dominated by trade and tariff tensions between the U.S. and multiple nations, Quasar Elizundia, research strategist at Pepperstone, says in a note. U.S. job openings at the end of 2024 unexpectedly resumed their downward trend, which raises questions about the labor market's strength and its ability to withstand global economic risks, raising uncertainty for investors, Elizundia adds. Spot gold is 0.2% higher at $2,846.13/oz, and has gained 8.5% so far this year.

That's the question posed by Morgan Stanley, which concludes any impact would be mostly be felt in metallurgical coal prices. Commodities strategist Helen Amos says China accounts for a relatively small share of U.S. coal exports. Still, U.S. exports of thermal and metallurgical coal to China increased over 2024. Morgan Stanley estimates tariffs would raise costs for around 3.4 million tons of thermal coal, representing less than 1% of traded volumes, and around 10.7 million tons of metallurgical coal, or some 3% of traded volumes. \"We see negligible or only modest potential price impact of China's coal import tariffs, given both coal markets are currently well supplied,\" Morgan Stanley says. \"But we watch for more meaningful shifts in met coal trade flows.\" (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)</p><p class=\"\">2111 GMT - Mexican chain Chipotle Mexican Grill is known for its guacamole, and is working to source its avocados and other supplies beyond Mexico to keep providing it. The company said in a 4Q earnings call that it now sources goods from Colombia, Peru and the Dominican Republic, with half of its avocados coming from Mexico. Tariffs on supplies from Mexico are a looming threat for U.S. companies. Chipotle said it would have a financial hit if the tariffs come to pass.

High cocoa prices have forced the snack giant to raise some prices in recent quarters. \"Our teams are well-equipped to stay agile and take the necessary actions to navigate this challenging operating environment,\" CEO Dirk Van de Put said.

WTI settles down 0.6% at $72.70 a barrel, while international benchmark Brent edges up 0.3% to $76.20 a barrel. The Chinese tariff on $5 billion of U.S. energy imports suggests a \"softer tone of the response\" to the U.S. tariffs, Alex Hodes of StoneX says in a note. \"The tariffs are also not expected to come into play until Feb. 10, leaving room for negotiations between the two nations.\" (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

A U.S. official said that Trump and Xi could speak on Wednesday.</p><p class=\"\">Trump has called the China tariffs \"an opening salvo\" and indicated that the U.S. will levy substantial tariffs against China if the countries can't come to an agreement.</p><p class=\"\">Earlier Wednesday, the U.S. Postal Service said it would stop accepting parcels from China and Hong Kong, cutting off a service that is popular with online vendors in China.</p><p class=\"\">Goldman Sachs analysts said that China's retaliatory tariffs appear much less than proportional compared with the U.S.'s 10% across-the-board additional tariff on $525 billion worth of Chinese goods. In the coming days, the U.S.'s reactions to China's retaliation will be among the key events to watch.</p><p class=\"\">Forex:</p><p class=\"\">The euro has limited scope to recover even as hopes rise that the EU can avert threatened U.S. trade tariffs after President Trump postponed a levy on Canadian and Mexican imports, ING's Francesco Pesole said.</p><p class=\"\">Trump's decision to delay tariffs on his U.S. neighbors could reflect domestic backlash over potential economic pain for U.S. consumers but the same isn't necessarily true for the EU, he said.</p><p class=\"\">Trump can afford to keep EU tariffs in place for a prolonged period, making the bloc feel some pain before striking a deal. \"With all this in mind, we are somewhat skeptical that the euro is bound for a major rally.\"</p><p class=\"\">Bonds:</p><p class=\"\">Supply of covered bonds by European banks is expected to decline in 2025, partly due to weak economic growth, ING's Marine Leleux said.</p><p class=\"\">ING expects the supply of euro-denominated covered bonds to drop by 7 billion euros, equivalent to $7.24 billion, this year versus 2024. A high number of redemptions due this year could mean bond refinancing dominates covered-bond supply this year, she said.</p><p class=\"\">Energy:</p><p class=\"\">Oil prices were lower after the U.S. implemented an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports and Beijing retaliated with measures of its own, raising concerns over the prospects for demand.</p><p class=\"\">Near-term prices for global crude oil could remain capped due to supply risks and potential trade challenges, said Hassan Fawaz, GivTrade's chairman and founder.</p><p class=\"\">Trade tensions between the U.S. and China may also affect demand levels, he said, adding that caution could dominate, leading to pressure on oil prices.</p><p class=\"\">Oil traders have also been concerned about plans by OPEC+, to boost production after the first quarter.</p><p class=\"\">Metals:</p><p class=\"\">Gold edged higher early Wednesday. Demand for haven assets like gold, which is testing record highs, was being boosted by uncertainty in a challenging global economic environment dominated by trade and tariff tensions between the U.S. and multiple nations, Pepperstone said.</p><p class=\"\">U.S. job openings at the end of 2024 unexpectedly resumed their downward trend, which raises questions about the labor market's strength and its ability to withstand global economic risks, raising uncertainty for investors, it added.</p><p class=\"\">--</p><p class=\"\">Base metals were broadly higher in Asia. China on Tuesday announced export restrictions on metals for various industries in retaliation to U.S. tariffs, but the list didn't include base metals, which supports the positive sentiment, Sucden Financial said.</p><p class=\"\">Given the moderate tariff increases from China and the U.S., markets are weighing the potential impact on both economies, which may be minimal provided that the situation doesn't escalate further, it added.</p><p class=\"\">--</p><p class=\"\">Iron ore declined, dragged by concerns over the tariffs China announced Tuesday. China imposed a 15% tariff on imports of U.S. coking coal, ANZ Research analysts said.</p><p class=\"\">Chinese iron-ore markets will probably come under pressure amid worries about weaker export-driven demand, the analysts added.</p><p class=\"\">TODAY'S TOP HEADLINES</p><p class=\"\">Fed's Daly Is in No Rush to Cut Interest Rates</p><p class=\"\">The Federal Reserve's Mary Daly is in no rush to lower interest rates until inflation is closing in on the central bank's 2% target.</p><p class=\"\">A solid economic backdrop gives the Fed the luxury of time to hold policy where it is until disinflation progress resumes, the San Francisco Fed President said on Tuesday. \"[The economy] came into 2025 in a very good place,\" Daly said at an event hosted by the Commonwealth Club World Affairs of California.</p><p class=\"\">Fed Vice Chair Jefferson Urges Patience on Rate Cuts</p><p class=\"\">A solid economy and still-too-high inflation argue for holding interest rates steady until more progress is made in slowing price growth, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson said on Tuesday evening, echoing recent remarks from several of his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.</p><p class=\"\">\"As long as the economy and labor market remain strong, I see it as appropriate for the Committee to be cautious in making further adjustments,\" Jefferson said in prepared remarks for an address at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., on Tuesday evening. \"Over the medium term, I continue to see a gradual reduction in the level of monetary policy restraint placed on the economy as we move toward a more neutral stance as the most likely outcome.\"</p><p class=\"\">Novo Nordisk Earnings Must Show GLP-1 Market Still Set for Big Growth</p><p class=\"\">When Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk reports its quarterly financial results on Wednesday, investors will be looking for reassurance the GLP-1 market is still on track for the enormous growth Wall Street expects.</p><p class=\"\">Novo shares have taken a beating in recent months, with the stock's American depositary receipts falling nearly 40% in the last six months of 2024. Shares first slid on growing worries that sales of its weight loss drug Wegovy and its Type 2 diabetes drug Ozempic wouldn't live up to the hype, and then on very disappointing trial data.</p><p class=\"\">Trump Says U.S. Will Take Over Gaza</p><p class=\"\">WASHINGTON-President Trump called for the U.S. to take long-term control of Gaza and for nearly two million Palestinian residents to permanently leave for neighboring countries, a break with decades of U.S. policy that left the idea of a Palestinian state in tatters.</p><p class=\"\">\"The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip,\" Trump said during a press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. \"I do see a long-term ownership position, and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East, and maybe the entire Middle East.\"</p><p class=\"\">Ukraine Open to Trump's Idea to Exchange Aid for Rare Earths-But There's a Catch</p><p class=\"\">President Trump has indicated he is open to supplying Ukraine with more weapons in exchange for access to the country's mineral resources. Ukraine is on board, but putting the plan into practice might not be so easy: Many of the minerals of greatest interest to the U.S. are in areas under Russian occupation or threatened by Moscow's advance.</p><p class=\"\">As a result, access to valuable Ukrainian natural resources will depend, at least in part, on the battle for eastern Ukraine, where Russian forces are currently advancing slowly but steadily.</p><p class=\"\">Nissan to Reject Honda's Merger Terms, Putting Deal in Peril</p><p class=\"\">Nissan's board is planning to reject Honda's terms for a combination of the two automakers, putting in danger a merger plan announced less than two months ago, people familiar with the matter said Wednesday.</p><p class=\"\">Nissan's board was scheduled to meet later Wednesday, and the people cautioned that no final decision to kill the deal has been made.</p><p class=\"\">Write to singaporeeditors@dowjones.com</p><p class=\"\">Expected Major Events for Wednesday</p><p class=\"\">07:00/DEN: 4Q Consumer credit</p><p class=\"\">07:45/FRA: Dec Industrial production index</p><p class=\"\">08:00/CZE: Dec Retail trade</p><p class=\"\">08:15/SPN: Jan Spain Services PMI</p><p class=\"\">08:30/EU: Jan EuroCOIN indicator of euro area economic activity</p><p class=\"\">08:45/ITA: Jan Italy Services PMI</p><p class=\"\">08:50/FRA: Jan France Services PMI</p><p class=\"\">08:55/GER: Jan Germany Services PMI</p><p class=\"\">09:00/EU: Jan Eurozone Services PMI</p><p class=\"\">09:00/UK: Jan UK monthly car registrations figures</p><p class=\"\">09:00/ITA: Dec Retail Sales</p><p class=\"\">09:30/UK: Jan S&amp;P Global UK Services PMI</p><p class=\"\">09:30/UK: Jan UK Official Reserves</p><p class=\"\">09:30/UK: Jan Narrow money (Notes &amp; Coin) and reserve balances</p><p class=\"\">10:00/EU: Dec PPI</p><p class=\"\">10:00/CYP: Jan Registered Unemployed</p><p class=\"\">10:00/LUX: Jan CPI</p><p class=\"\">11:00/FRA: Dec OECD CPI</p><p class=\"\">11:00/POR: 4Q Employment statistics</p><p class=\"\">16:59/POL: Polish interest rate decision</p><p class=\"\">All times in GMT.
