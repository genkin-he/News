While this was in line with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's forecasts, money markets should expect a cut in the official cash rate later this month of \"at least\" 50 basis points, says Kieran Davies, chief macro strategist at Coolabah Capital. The unemployment rate almost matches the peak of 5.2% reached during the short Covid recession in 2020, Davies notes. (james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ)</p><p class=\"\">2032 ET - From a policy perspective, data showing New Zealand's unemployment rates at a 4-year high of 5.1% reaffirm the view that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will continue to lower rates sequentially over 1H, including another 50-basis-point cut at a policy meeting later this month, says Andrew Boak, chief economist at Goldman Sachs. Boak continues to expect the RBNZ to slow the pace of cuts to 25 basis points per meeting, starting in April, ultimately reaching a terminal official cash rate of 3.0% in July.

While major exporters like Techtronic and Shenzhou have diversified production into Asean to avoid tariffs, smaller Chinese companies are unable to do so given difficulty in obtaining bank loans and lack of management resources, they say in a note. The tariff hike could cause them significant distress and spike the unemployment rate in China as these firms constitute about 79% of the total workforce, they add. That could lead China to roll out more stimulus to counter the economic impact.

While that can't be ruled out, Citi Research analysts led by Eric Lau think tariffs are unlikely to be on par with those levied at Mexico or China as Asean is an attractive region to help dilute CPI inflation for U.S. imported goods. Many major China exporters have diversified production into Asean to avoid tariffs but focus on labor-intensive, non-tech industries such as apparel and footwear that aren't targeted for reshoring into the U.S., they say. Mexico meanwhile has attracted automotive supply-chain industries as the U.S. government seems inclined to emphasize auto manufacturing reshoring, they add. \"The tariff hike scenario in Mexico may not necessarily apply to Asean, in our view.\"(fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1937 ET - South Korea's benchmark Kospi rises 0.9% to 2503.94 in early trade, as battery, semiconductor and auto stocks advance.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Solstice Minerals  has made a strategic move into the high-flying copper market with the acquisition of the advanced Nanadie project in Western Australia. The company has entered into a binding agreement with Cyprium Metals  for 100% of the project, which comprises multiple granted licences covering 130 square kilometres south-east of Meekatharra in the Murchison District. Morgan Stanley recently highlighted copper as its most preferred base metal next year, predicting prices will climb to around $10,600 (US$9,500) a tonne by the end of 2025, while both Rio Tinto and BHP have recently highlighted copper as a key resource in their growth plans. Copper asset search Solstice chief executive officer and managing director Nick Castleden said the company had been on the hunt for strategic growth opportunities in copper for some time. “Particularly focusing on those rare assets that are located in stable and proven mining-friendly jurisdictions with limited competing land use, offer significant exploration upside and can be secured at a reasonable price,” he added. “Nanadie ticks all of those boxes and we are delighted to have secured such a complementary addition to our portfolio.” Favourable outlook “Copper is widely seen as a commodity with one of the most favourable long-term supply-demand outlooks of all the major metals and yet finding quality assets is extremely difficult,” Mr Castleden said. “We are excited by the scale, geometry and mineral resource estimate (MRE) growth potential at Nanadie and recognise that mafic magmatic systems like these can also deliver zones of increased grade.” Solstice also sees the potential for new mineralised positions with targeted exploration. Significant upside Nanadie is located within a granted mining lease, with strike extensions that offer greenfield targets for shallow drilling. While it is yet to carry out metallurgical test work, Solstice considers the style of sulphide mineralisation to be suitable for conventional grind and flotation processing with the potential to deliver a clean copper-gold concentrate. “Our medium-term work plan will be exploration-focused, aiming to scope the mostly unconstrained Nanadie disseminated system beyond MRE boundaries and explore for new copper-gold mineralisation along strike and at depth,” Mr Castleden said. Initial targets identified Solstice plans to follow up two significant and partially defined magmatic intrusive-style mineral systems at Nanadie and the Stark copper-gold, nickel and platinum group elements prospect. Mr Castleden said Nanadie offers excellent exploration potential to build on a JORC-compliant inferred MRE of 40.4 million tonnes at 0.4% copper and 0.1 grams per tonne gold for 162,000t of contained copper and 130,000 ounces of gold. The company believes there is the possibility that mineralisation extends beyond the limits of previous drilling in most directions.</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">From a policy perspective, data showing New Zealand's unemployment rates at a 4-year high of 5.1% reaffirm the view that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will continue to lower rates sequentially over 1H, including another 50-basis-point cut at a policy meeting later this month, says Andrew Boak, chief economist at Goldman Sachs. Boak continues to expect the RBNZ to slow the pace of cuts to 25 basis points per meeting, starting in April, ultimately reaching a terminal official cash rate of 3.0% in July. Still, the risks are skewed to faster and deeper cuts if the recent improvement in high-frequency surveys does not translate into some improvement in the economy, he adds.

Survey data reveal that the misconceptions and stereotypes around the condition can weigh heavily on the minds of those living with diabetes, creating one more barrier and potentially preventing them from managing their health.1</p><p class=\"\">\"How many times have we heard 'That looks like diabetes on a plate' when we're watching a movie, eating at a restaurant or scrolling through social media?,\" said Dr. Susan Guzman, Behavioral Diabetes Institute co-founder, clinical psychologist, and diabetes specialist. \"After more than two decades of research and working with people managing diabetes, I can tell you that misconceptions around diabetes take a real toll on people.
