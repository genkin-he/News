Investor access to bitcoin jumped last month after the U.S. approved the introduction of an exchange traded fund that tracks the cryptocurrency's price, he says. \"Further improvements to investor access have begun under the Trump administration.\" Bitcoin volatility could fall gradually once the ETF market matures and as the financial-market infrastructure supporting the bitcoin market improves. Standard Chartered expects bitcoin to rise to $200,000 by end-2025, to $300,000 by end-2026, $400,000 by end-2027 and $500,000 by end-2028. It last trades up 1.6% at $98,241, according to LSEG.

China's relatively measured response to U.S. President Trump's 10% levy on Chinese imports has raised hopes for a deal, he says. Markets are optimistic that a deal can be struck before China's retaliatory tariffs kick in on Feb. 10. However, a sustained dollar fall looks unlikely amid continued uncertainties. \"A consensus U.S.-China deal does seem the most likely scenario, but we sense markets are underpricing the risk of a more prolonged trade spat.\" The DXY dollar index falls 0.5% to a low of 107.373. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1019 GMT - Bitcoin rises slightly but trades below the key $100,000 level amid uncertainty over President Trump's tariff plans. China's plans for retaliatory tariffs after Trump imposed a new 10% levy on Chinese imports add uncertainty to risky assets including cryptocurrencies, Saxo Bank analysts say in a note. Market sentiment is also muted after the Trump administration discussed the potential inclusion of bitcoin in a newly proposed U.S. sovereign wealth fund, sparking speculation over institutional adoption, they say. \"Traders remain focused on regulatory developments and macroeconomic shifts.\" Bitcoin rises 1.1% to $97,523, according to LSEG.

Inevitably, a sustained strength in dollar forces overseas investors to sell dollar-based assets, tightening financial conditions and this typically triggers the Federal Reserve to ease its policy, they say. \"One should look at the U.S. current account deficit for clues on the Fed's policy path.\" The 10-year U.S. Treasury-German Bund yield spread is 212 basis points, up 1 basis point, according to Tradeweb.(emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0943 GMT - The U.K. Debt Management Office auction of the July 2053 green gilt at 1000 GMT is expected to perform well in relative value terms, RBC Capital Markets analysts say in a note.

The FTSE 100 reached a new high of 8692.84 on Jan. 31. Any hints of more interest-rate cuts could reignite a U.K. equities rally, Hathorn says.

Despite stable 4Q GDP growth, policymakers are expected to remain focused on reversing previous rate hikes, he notes. With USD/IDR stable around 16,300, another cut is likely, he reckons. Inflation softened in January, prompting a downward revision to Tan's 2025 average inflation forecast to 1.4% from 1.7%, below BI's 1.5%-3.5% target. If electricity discounts are extended beyond February, inflation could fall further, strengthening the case for continued monetary easing, he adds.

The central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged. This means the decision will be a \"non-event\" with the focus on any signals about future policy, ING analyst Frantisek Taborsky says in a note. The policy statement Wednesday and NBP Governor Adam Glapinski's press conference Thursday could both sound hawkish again by indicating rates will remain restrictive, Taborsky says. \"However, it's hard to imagine at this point what more the governor might add to the hawkish message from January.\" The NBP's decision is expected at 1400 GMT. EUR/PLN trades at 4.2112. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0844 GMT - Singapore's retail sales will likely pick up this year, says OCBC's Selena Ling. Retail sales contracted 2.9% on year in December, marking its worst performance since February 2022, she writes. But with the Singapore Tourism Board expecting 17 million-18.5 million visitors this year that could generate S$29 billion to S$30.5 billion in revenue, things look brighter for the retail sector. Domestic consumption is also expected to be supported by a resilient labor market, Ling says. However, she cautions that external headwinds pose as a key risk for the retail sector, and a challenging trade environment may dampen near-term market sentiment. OCBC expects Singapore's retail sales to expand around 2% in 2025 compared to 2024's 1.2% and 2023's 2.3%.(amanda.lee@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0837 GMT - The Canadian dollar rises to a two-week high against the U.S. dollar as it continues to recover after President Trump agreed to pause a 25% tariff on Canada, ING's Francesco Pesole says in a note. The Canadian dollar could rise further if tariff risks are entirely priced out, he says. There is a residual 1% risk premium embedded into USD/CAD. \"That said, we are not sure markets will or should move to a completely optimistic stance on the U.S.-Canada trade spat.\" There are no clear hints Canada will be spared from another round of potential universal tariffs.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Bunge Global SA, a leading global agribusiness and food company, has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2024. The company, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, operates in more than 40 countries and is a major player in oilseed processing and the production of specialty plant-based oils and fats.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Financial Highlights</strong></p> <p class=\"\">For the full year 2024, Bunge reported a GAAP diluted EPS of $7.99, a significant decrease from $14.87 in the prior year. On an adjusted basis, excluding certain gains/charges and mark-to-market timing differences, the EPS was $9.19 compared to $13.66 in 2023. The fourth quarter GAAP diluted EPS was $4.36, slightly up from $4.18 in the previous year, while the adjusted EPS was $2.13, down from $3.70.</p><p class=\"\">Net income attributable to Bunge for the full year was $1.137 billion, a sharp decline from $2.243 billion in 2023. The company's core segment EBIT also saw a decrease, with $2.171 billion reported for 2024 compared to $3.717 billion in the previous year.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Business and Operational Highlights</strong></p> <p class=\"\">In the Agribusiness segment, Bunge experienced lower processing results, partially offset by higher merchandising. The Refined and Specialty Oils segment saw lower results primarily driven by North America. The company made substantial progress on growth investments and strategic partnerships, as well as the divestiture of its sugar &amp; bioenergy joint venture.</p><p class=\"\">During the fourth quarter, Bunge repurchased $500 million of shares, bringing the year-to-date total to $1.1 billion.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Bunge is in the late stages of regulatory processes for its announced combination with Viterra and CJ Selecta. The company has also achieved its 100% traceability and monitoring targets in Brazil, marking a significant step in its sustainability efforts.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Management's Perspective</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Greg Heckman, Bunge’s Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our team closed out a year of significant achievements for Bunge. We made great progress on integration planning for our announced combination with Viterra and, having received the vast majority of regulatory approvals, we expect to close the transaction soon. We continued to make productivity improvements from our investments in the business while returning significant capital to shareholders. And we took meaningful steps in sustainability by achieving our 100% traceability and monitoring targets in Brazil.\"</p><p class=\"\">Heckman also noted the challenges faced due to increased geopolitical uncertainty but expressed confidence in the company's ability to continue creating value for all stakeholders.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Future Outlook</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Looking ahead to 2025, Bunge forecasts a full-year adjusted EPS of approximately $7.75, excluding announced acquisitions expected to close during the year. The company anticipates lower results in the Agribusiness segment, particularly in Processing, while Merchandising results are expected to be slightly down. Refined and Specialty Oils results are projected to decline due to a more balanced supply and demand environment in North America. However, Milling and Corporate and Other segments are expected to see improved results.</p><p class=\"\">Bunge also expects an adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 25%, net interest expense between $250 to $280 million, capital expenditures of $1.5 to $1.7 billion, and depreciation and amortization of approximately $490 million.</p><p class=\"\">SEC Filing: <a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1996862/000199686225000006/bg-20250205.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Bunge Global SA [ BG ] - 8-K - Feb. 05, 2025</a></p></span></div>",
