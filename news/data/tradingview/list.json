            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">BNP Paribas reported strong underlying trends for the fourth quarter and consensus expectations could rise, RBC Capital Markets analyst Anke Reingen says in a research note. The French bank's quarterly result as well as it CET1 ratio exceeded expectations, the analyst says. The bank's new 2024-2026 net income growth rate target suggests at least a 4% consensus upgrade, Reingen says. The slight fall in the bank's 2025 return on tangible equity to 11.5% from a range of 11.5% to 12% previously, given consensus expectations at 10.4%, should offer relief to investors fearing a steeper downgrade. BNP Paribas' targeted revenue growth of at least 5% per year for 2025-2026 is also higher than investors had expected. BNP shares trade 2.5% higher to 65.94 euros.

EBITDA margin improved by 232bps YoY to 21.7%. Despite subdued domestic order booking during the quarter, enquiry generation remained strong across key industrial segments such as steel, cement, and oil &amp; gas. Encouraged by an uptick in domestic order finalization in Q3, the management expects improved order booking in Q4FY25. TRIV’s strategic entry into CO2-based energy storage systems marks a significant growth opportunity, positioning it at the forefront of emerging energy transition technologies. This initiative, coupled with its planned annual capex of Rs1.2-1.5bn to enhance and modularize its capabilities, including investments in R&amp;D, will drive the next phase of growth. Internationally, TRIV continues to witness robust demand from the renewable energy sector, particularly in waste-to-heat energy, geothermal, small modular reactors, and biomass-based power generation. Additionally, its strong order book for API and IPG turbines provides visibility for sustained growth in the products segment. The company is also leveraging its expanding aftermarket offerings—including spare parts, services, and refurbishments—to strengthen its presence in the rotating equipment space.</p><p class=\"\">Outlook</p><p class=\"\">We believe TRIV’s prospects continue to remain strong due to 1) healthy enquiry pipeline across markets, 2) growing share of higher margin exports &amp; aftermarket sales, 3) strong traction in both industrial &amp; API drive turbines, and 4) robust order book with strong inflows across businesses. The stock is trading at a P/E of 39.6x/30.0x on FY26/27E EPS. We maintain our ‘Buy’ rating with a TP of Rs800 (same as earlier), valuing the stock at a P/E of 43x Sep-26E (same as earlier).</p><p class=\"\">For all recommendations report, click here</p><p class=\"\">Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.
