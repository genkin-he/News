The company said $150 million will go to its Cactus, Texas, plant to improve the part of the facility where carcasses are processed into primal cuts and expand its ground beef room.

On a seasonally-adjusted basis, light-vehicle sales came at a \"strapping\" 2.15 million, DesRosiers says. The firm adds it's difficult to put January's performance in context, given Trump's tariff threat. As a result, DesRosiers says it's hard to discern whether strong sales were the result of fears over sharply higher car prices, or a sign of solid domestic demand.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Feb.  04, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — GetInsured, a leading provider of health insurance technology and consumer assistance solutions, is pleased to announce the resounding success of Georgia Access following the 2025 Open Enrollment Period. This state-based exchange (SBE), launched in partnership with the Georgia Office of Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner, has exceeded expectations, setting new benchmarks for enrollment and innovation. As the 2025 Open Enrollment Period concludes, Georgia Access’s performance highlights the value of SBEs in expanding health coverage and improving consumer experiences.</p><p class=\"\">During its first Open Enrollment Period, Georgia Access successfully provided health coverage to over 1.5 million Georgians, representing an impressive nearly 15.5% increase from the state's previous enrollment under the Federally Facilitated Marketplace (FFM) on Healthcare.gov. This remarkable growth highlights the impact of transitioning to a fully autonomous state-based exchange, demonstrating both the strength of a state-led approach and the effectiveness of the GetInsured platform in expanding access to affordable health coverage. At the end of its inaugural year, Georgia Access is now the second-largest SBE in the country.</p><p class=\"\">Georgia Access exceeded expectations and made history with its innovative launch, becoming the first state-based exchange to fully leverage Enhanced Direct Enrollment (EDE) technology and advanced AI tools. Approximately 70% of all Georgia Access consumers or their agents used an EDE partner to enroll in coverage. Additionally, over the course of Open Enrollment, more than 17,300 licensed and certified agents participated in the Exchange; with nearly 80% of Georgia consumers received assistance from an agent. This achievement highlights the value of local expertise, proving that Georgians are uniquely equipped to serve their own communities. The platform’s success underscores its strength and commitment to delivering a truly consumer-first experience.</p><p class=\"\">“Georgia Access exemplifies the transformative power of technology combined with an unwavering dedication to uplifting and serving the community,” said Chini Krishnan, CEO of GetInsured. “Through close collaboration with the state of Georgia and our partners, we’ve delivered a platform that not only meets the immediate needs of Georgians but also sets a new standard for SBEs nationwide.”</p><p class=\"\">Georgia Access is the first SBE to fully leverage Enhanced Direct Enrollment (EDE) technology, streamlining the enrollment process for consumers and enabling them to seamlessly compare and select plans. The platform’s robust performance is further enhanced by the Interactive Virtual Agent (IVA), which provides 24/7 assistance for routine inquiries. Georgia is one of the first states to integrate AI tools like IVA into their enrollment platform and ensure consumers receive timely and efficient support while maintaining high standards of security and privacy. </p><p class=\"\">For more complex needs, an integrated contact center staffed with trained agents offers comprehensive support, ensuring every Georgian has access to the help they need. This open enrollment period, the contact center fielded more than 300,00 calls with nearly 95% of all consumer issues being resolved during the first call to the contact center. </p><p class=\"\">“The transition to Georgia’s unique SBE model was an ambitious undertaking, but GetInsured’s people, technology, and operational expertise have proven critical to its success,” said Cheryl Gardner, Executive Director of Georgia Access. “The successful completion of Open Enrollment underscores our mission to provide simple and accessible pathways to health coverage. With GetInsured’s support, we have made significant strides toward ensuring that more Georgians can secure affordable health insurance, setting a new standard for SBEs.”</p><p class=\"\">The success of Georgia Access is a testament to the collaborative partnership between GetInsured, the Georgia Office of Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner, and other key partners, including insurance carriers and EDE partners. Not only have their combined efforts created a consumer-centric platform that simplifies the path to health coverage, but they also have established a model for other states to follow, positioning Georgia Access as a leader in SBE innovation. </p><p class=\"\">With its innovative tools and reliable service, Georgia Access serves as a model for other states seeking to take their exchanges to the next level.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About GetInsured: </strong>GetInsured is a leading technology provider for state-based health insurance exchanges, offering an ACA-compliant cloud-based SaaS technology platform and integrated consumer assistance center operations.

Economic incentives provided by the token system encourage increased rates of recycling and innovation in plastic use reduction strategies. Stakeholders along the entire value chain can participate, making for holistic change which is sustainable.\"</p><p class=\"\">Frost &amp; Sullivan further highlight how SMX's Plastic Cycle Token system is set to transform plastic waste management with technology that embeds molecular markers into plastics, enabling full lifecycle traceability and accountability from production to reuse. This ensures compliance with Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regulations while unlocking new revenue streams through tokenized plastic credits. By integrating blockchain, traceability tools, and market-driven incentives, the Plastic Cycle Token creates a self-sustaining ecosystem that benefits manufacturers, recyclers, global populations, and financial institutions.</p><p class=\"\">To explore the full findings of Frost &amp; Sullivan's report, read the complete analysis here: (LINK).</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About the Plastic Cycle Token</strong></p><p class=\"\">For decades, carbon credits have been the go-to tool for addressing environmental challenges, but they often fail to account for the real-world flow of materials. With over 400 million metric tons of plastic waste generated annually, much of it remains outside traditional sustainability frameworks. SMX Ltd. , a leader in traceability solutions, is changing that with the Plastic Cycle Token (PCT)-a breakthrough in plastic waste accountability.</p><p class=\"\">Unlike carbon credits, which lack direct material verification, PCTs are tied to actual plastic flows. SMX's technology allows plastics to be marked, tracked, and verified throughout their lifecycle, ensuring that each traded token represents real plastic being recycled and reintroduced into supply chains. This creates a transparent and measurable system that benefits industries struggling to meet sustainability mandates.</p><p class=\"\">Rather than penalizing companies with rigid quotas and taxes-especially in the EU-SMX's approach incentivizes participation in the circular economy. Beverage giants like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, constantly under regulatory scrutiny, can use PCTs to demonstrate verifiable recycling efforts. The same applies to MedTech firms dealing with sterile packaging, aviation companies using lightweight composites, and energy firms seeking supply chain transparency. By ensuring the traceability of plastics across industries, PCTs help businesses improve ESG performance without sacrificing efficiency.</p><p class=\"\">With real-time tracking and verifiable proof of plastic usage, PCTs eliminate the guesswork in sustainability reporting. This transparency appeals to all parties across the supply chain that are focused on ESG accountability, allowing them to distinguish genuine sustainability efforts from corporate greenwashing. By shifting from penalties to incentives, SMX is not only addressing the global plastic crisis-it is pioneering a market-driven solution that makes environmental responsibility measurable, transparent, and economically viable.</p><p class=\"\">About SMX (Security Matters) Public Limited Company</p><p class=\"\">As global businesses face new and complex challenges relating to carbon neutrality and meeting new governmental and regional regulations and standards, SMX is able to offer players along the value chain access to its marking, tracking, measuring and digital platform technology to transition more successfully to a low-carbon economy.</p><p class=\"\"><em><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Forward-Looking Statements</strong></em></p><p class=\"\">The information in this press release includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Agricultural research firm SovEcon says that the average domestic price for Russian wheat has risen to 15,526 rubles, or $158 per metric ton. In U.S. dollars, that's up 9% since the start of the year, according to SovEcon. The firm says that exporters have been increasingly buying up Russian wheat in recent months, supporting the higher price. However, exports fell back in January, SovEcon says — and Russia's ability to supply wheat to the world may prove to be weaker in 2025 due to troubled weather this winter. CBOT wheat is up 1.1%.

Futures are up 0.5% at $2,871.60 a troy ounce, having peaked at $2,874.50 in European late afternoon trading. The precious metal has traded in a relatively narrow range, with rising U.S. bond yields and a stronger dollar limiting the upward rally, XS.com's Rania Gule says in a note. That said, concerns about potential economic fallout from President Trump's tariffs and other inflationary policies provide strong support for gold as a safe-haven asset, Gule writes. The overall upward trend for gold remains intact, and any corrective pullbacks should be seen as buying opportunities as supportive factors haven't fundamentally changed, Gule says. As markets remain uncertain, gold will likely stay a focus for investors both as a hedge and an investment opportunity, Gule adds.

Brent crude is down 2.3% to $74.22 a barrel, while WTI falls 3.3% to $70.75 a barrel. Both benchmarks erased all the previous session's gains, also due to easing concerns over immediate disruption of Canadian and Mexican oil flows after U.S. President Trump agreed to hold off imposing tariffs on the two neighboring countries. \"The next key support levels to watch are $69.50 and $66,\" says Razan Hilal, market analyst at Forex. \"A deeper decline could signal the start of a more extended bearish trend.\" (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">--</p><p class=\"\">ADM Cuts Jobs Due to Tough Ag Market — Market Talk</p><p class=\"\">0814 ET - Grain trader ADM says it is cutting 600 to 750 jobs globally in 2025 and plans to cut between $500 million and $750 million in costs over the next three to five years.

Base metals reacted to the threat of U.S. tariffs in Monday's session with losses, compounded by the disappointing slip in the Chinese Caixin index for private companies, Commerzbank analysts say in a note. The main burden is the concern that this round of tariffs could just be the beginning, Commerzbank says. The initial reaction to postponed Mexico and Canada tariffs was a small relief rally, especially as U.S. economic data also surprised to the upside, analysts write. That said, some of these gains were reversed early Tuesday on China's countermeasures, and the prevailing hope is that it will stick with just these tariffs, Commerzbank adds.

Beijing said it would impose a 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas products as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil and other products such as agricultural machinery, effective on Feb. 10. \"As China only sourced 1.8% of its crude oil imports from the U.S. last year, the impact on the oil market should be limited,\" commodity analyst Carsten Fritsch says in a note.

The precious metal is holding close to highs as the U.S. dollar weakens, ActivTrades' Ricardo Evangelista says in a note. The greenback gave up gains after the Trump administration delayed higher tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a month. That said, Washington hasn't backed down on tariffs for Chinese imports. As Beijing retaliates, the threat of an all-out trade war escalates, Evangelista says. This scenario casts a dark shadow over global economic growth prospects, naturally driving increased safe-haven demand and creating scope for further gold gains, Evangelista writes.

Palm oil prices have risen in recent sessions amid concerns over tariffs on Canadian canola oil as well as an urgent need for alternative vegetable oils, Kenanga Futures says in a research note. Trump's delay of tariff implementations likely triggered profit-taking activities following recent rallies, they say. Meanwhile, ongoing worries about India's declining demand, which is at an 11-year low, could further dampen market sentiment.

However, \"we still see that the market expects significant LNG volumes to reach the market in 2026, pushing the price down.\" The EU needs more LNG to meet its storage-filling target of 90% by Nov. 1., but inventories have been depleting fast and the bloc barely reached the Feb. 1 target of 50%.

President Trump delayed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports for one month after the countries reached an agreement, though an additional 10% China tariff has proceeded. The broader end point around further U.S. tariff developments remain uncertain, Macquarie analysts say in a note. From the perspective of industrial metals, the implementation of the tariffs for any period of time will be a net bearish development, Macquarie says. The tariffs would drag on global goods demand and industrial production growth, by extension hurting commodities demand. At the same time, they would introduce further headwinds by boosting the U.S. dollar and reducing rate cut prospects, Macquarie adds.

Gold prices are correcting after the countries made a deal that will postpone U.S. tariffs by at least a month, ING analysts say in a note. However, the uncertainty over trade and tariffs continue to keep the price relatively well supported, they say. Tariffs on China are proceeding. Investors sought out safe havens in Monday's session though the stronger dollar provided significant headwinds, likely capping an even stronger rally, ING says.

Other companies in the grocery space that would get hit by tariffs and higher prices are Mondelez International and WK Kellogg, given that they don't produce essential food and would see their volumes go down, Spillane says.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">March NY world sugar #11 (<a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/SB*0/overview\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">SBH25</a>) today is up +0.31 (+1.61%), and March London ICE white sugar #5 (<a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/SW*0/overview\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">SWH25</a>) is up +9.80 (+1.91%).</p><p class=\"\">Sugar prices today are climbing, with NY sugar posting a 4-week high and London sugar posting a 7-week high. Reduced sugar output in India is boosting prices after Centrum reported today that India's 2024/25 sugar production from October 1 to January 31 was down -12.2% y/y to 16.5 MMT.</p><p class=\"\">Strength in the Brazilian real (<a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.barchart.com/forex/quotes/%5EUSDBRL/overview\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">^USDBRL</a>) is also lifting sugar prices as the real climbed to a 2-1/2 month high against the dollar today. The stronger real discourages export selling from Brazil's sugar producers. </p><p class=\"\">Sugar prices have been in a 4-month-long downtrend. On January 21, NY sugar posted a 5-1/2 month nearest-futures low, and London sugar posted a 3-1/2 year low. An improving global sugar supply outlook is weighing on sugar prices. On January 20, India said it would allow its sugar mills to export 1 MMT of sugar this season, easing its restrictions placed on sugar exports in 2023. India has restricted sugar exports since October 2023 to maintain adequate domestic supplies. India allowed mills to export only 6.1 MMT of sugar during the 2022/23 season to September 30 after allowing exports of a record 11.1 MMT in the previous season. </p><p class=\"\">On November 21, the International Sugar Organization (ISO) reduced its 2024/25 global sugar deficit forecast to -2.51 MMT, compared to an August forecast of -3.58 MMT. ISO also raised its 2023/24 global sugar surplus estimate to 1.31 MMT from an August projection of 200,000 MT. </p><p class=\"\">The outlook for higher sugar production in Thailand is bearish for sugar prices. On October 29, Thailand's Office of the Cane and Sugar Board projected that Thailand's 2024/25 sugar production would jump by +18% y/y to 10.35 MMT. Thailand produced 8.77 MMT of sugar in the 2023/24 season that ended in April. Thailand is the world's third-largest sugar producer and the second-largest sugar exporter.</p><p class=\"\">Sugar found support last Wednesday after Czarnikow cut its Thailand 2024/25 sugar production estimate to 10.8 MMT from a previous forecast of 11.6 MMT.</p><p class=\"\">Drought and excessive heat last year caused fires in Brazil that damaged sugar crops in Brazil's top sugar-producing state of Sao Paulo. Sugar cane industry group Orplana said that as many as 2,000 fire outbreaks affected up to 80,000 hectares of planted sugarcane in Sao Paulo. Green Pool Commodity Specialists noted that as much as 5 MMT of sugar cane may have been lost due to the fires. Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, cut its 2024/25 Brazil sugar production estimate from November 21 to 44 MMT from a previous forecast of 46 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat. Unica reported today that cumulative 2024/25 Center-South sugar output through mid-January is down -5.5% y/y to 39.794 MMT. </p><p class=\"\">Sugar has support from signs of smaller sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer. The ISM projects India's 2024/25 sugar production to fall -15% y/y to a 5-year low of 27.27 MMT.</p><p class=\"\">As a supportive factor for sugar prices, the ISO on August 30 forecasted 2024/25 global sugar production of 179.3 MMT, down -1.1% y/y from 181.3 MMT in 2023/24. </p><p class=\"\">The USDA, in its bi-annual report released November 21, projected that global 2024/25 sugar production would climb +1.5% y/y to a record 186.619 MMT and that global 2024/25 human sugar consumption would increase +1.2% y/y to a record 179.63 MMT. The USDA also forecasted that 2024/25 global sugar ending stocks would decline -6.1% y/y to 45.427 MMT. </p><p class=\"\"><em>On the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.
