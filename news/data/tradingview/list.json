            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">BURLINGAME, Calif., Feb.  05, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — In an industry-defining moment, Accumulus Synergy (“Accumulus”) has powered Amgen’s groundbreaking regulatory submission: the first-ever, digitally generated Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) Post Approval Change (PAC) dossier, delivered to the Reference Country and nearly two dozen participating Reliance countries, simultaneously. This transformative achievement aims to redefine the regulatory landscape by accelerating global approvals while setting a new benchmark for transparency and efficiency.</p><p class=\"\">Leveraging the Accumulus platform, the digitally generated dossier created by Amgen using its proprietary AI and novel Structured Content and Data Management (SCDM) software is being reviewed by the Reliance Reference Country and all participating regulators at the same time. This means that every jurisdiction involved has real-time access to all regulatory information, from submission details to ongoing questions, answers, and updates, as it becomes available. This transparency not only has the potential to accelerate review timelines but also to pave the way for a fully digital regulatory ecosystem.</p><p class=\"\">“For the first time ever, sponsors are able to submit a single, digital, global dossier to multiple regulators around the world with just a click of a button,” said Francisco Nogueira, CEO of Accumulus. “The Accumulus platform isn’t just a technological advancement, it’s a reimagining of regulatory processes which could ultimately lead to patients receiving the treatments they need sooner.”</p><p class=\"\">With this submission, Accumulus and Amgen have taken a crucial first step in redefining the Reliance concept. Unlike conventional Reliance projects where regulators must wait for the Reference Country’s completed review to gain access to critical data, Amgen is utilizing the Accumulus platform to democratize information in real-time to all participating regulators, equipping all stakeholders with the same information at the same time.</p><p class=\"\">Leveraging the Accumulus platform’s cutting-edge digital innovation and the transformative power of Reliance pathways, Accumulus and Amgen are working to minimize CMC variances caused by lengthy registration timelines and diverging regulatory requirements, addressing one of the most persistent challenges in global regulatory filings. This approach aims to realize more efficient review and approval timelines, the return of facility capacity to sponsors, and accelerated access of medicines to patients globally.</p><p class=\"\">“As a company dedicated to innovation, this is a proud moment for Amgen. Simultaneous regulatory submissions through the cloud could lead to faster reviews, approvals, and accelerated access to medicines for patients who need new treatment solutions,” said Mark Taisey, Senior Vice President Global Regulatory Affairs, Amgen. “Using Amgen’s proprietary AI and SCDM software, we are looking forward to the next step in the industry’s digital evolution. By moving to cloud-based digital dossiers, we’re unlocking the true potential of digital transformation in regulatory collaboration. Democratized access to information ensures that every country, regardless of its role in the Reliance process, has the tools and data needed to drive faster decisions.”</p><p class=\"\">“As Accumulus continues to lead the charge in global regulatory transformation, it remains committed to creating a faster, more transparent, and collaborative future,” added Nogueira. “We’re not just talking about the future of regulatory submissions; we’re actively creating it. Our Platform is reshaping how information is shared, how regulators and industry collaborate, and how approval timelines are accelerated, all with an unwavering commitment to the highest standards of compliance and security.”</p><p class=\"\">About Accumulus Synergy</p><p class=\"\">Accumulus Synergy is a global, nonprofit industry association developing a transformative data exchange platform that aims to enable enhanced collaboration and efficiency between life sciences organizations and global Regulatory Authorities while also affording users the ability to extract dynamic, data-driven insights. Accumulus is working with key stakeholders in the life sciences – regulatory ecosystem to build and sustain a platform that aims to meet regulatory, cybersecurity, and privacy requirements spanning clinical, safety, chemistry, and manufacturing and regulatory exchanges and submissions. Accumulus Synergy Sponsors include leading global pharmaceutical companies.</p><p class=\"\">Media Contact</p><p class=\"\">E: allison.mari@accumulus.org</p><p class=\"\">P: 540-907-6053</p></span></div>",

This collaboration will highlight Coach Harbaugh in live and social media initiatives.</p><p class=\"\">Even nearly five years after the start of the pandemic, COVID-19 is causing an American death approximately every 9 minutes,1 and, in 2024, caused approximately 59,000 deaths,2 665,000 hospitalizations,2 and growing burden of Long COVID over time, despite broadly available and utilized vaccine boosts and small molecule therapy. In addition, the percentage of COVID-19 associated hospitalizations with intensive care unit (ICU) admissions is once again on the rise.3 A recent article published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases4 discusses how the current health and economic burden of the long-term impacts of COVID-19 may already exceed several other chronic diseases and will persist as COVID-19 cases continue to rise. This could be a significant drain not only on patients, but also on businesses, third party payers, healthcare systems, and all of society.</p><p class=\"\">“As a long-time coach, I want players on the field, fans in the stands, and friends and family gathering to enjoy the game. But, COVID-19 has and continues to sideline many people,” said Coach Harbaugh. “While COVID-19 may seem like old news to some, many Americans continue to get sick, are hospitalized, and are dying from COVID-19, despite many of us having been vaccinated. The extent of damage to our bodies in the long-term is still unknown. The good news is for many there are options other than vaccines and people are encouraged to visit www.expandtheiroptions.com to learn more.”</p><p class=\"\">“We are thrilled to have Coach Harbaugh on our team as we work to educate healthcare providers as well as the millions of immunocompromised people we serve about the continued prevalence and significant risks of COVID-19, which is common, but not a cold,” noted Julie Green, Invivyd’s Chief Human Resources Officer and Head of Communications. “We are grateful to Coach Harbaugh for his passion to raise awareness about the ongoing prevalence and impact of COVID-19 and his determination for people to seek options that may help them find ways to safely enjoy activities they love, like watching the big game with family and friends.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Invivyd</strong></p><p class=\"\">Invivyd, Inc.  is a biopharmaceutical company devoted to delivering protection from serious viral infectious diseases, beginning with SARS-CoV-2.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Freemelt has received an order from UKAEA (United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority) to conduct production scalability tests of 3D printed tungsten tiles for fusion energy power plants, strengthening Freemelt’s position in the energy sector. The order value is approximately SEK 0.7 million with expected delivery during the first quarter of 2025.</p><p class=\"\">This project is a continuation of previous feasibility studies that Freemelt has performed in collaboration with UKAEA. The proof-of-concept project target to demonstrate volume production using Freemelt’s E-PBF (Electron Beam Powder Bed Fusion) technology and industrial machine, eMELT.</p><p class=\"\">Freemelt and UKAEA have been collaborating since April 2023 and has previously carried out two feasibility studies, the first focused on process development, and the second focused on application testing. In this new project Freemelt will demonstrate production scalability of tungsten tiles, a critical step in validating the potential for future volume production. As part of this study the repeatability of the E-PBF process will be evaluated to support component qualification programmes for potential use in next generation fusion energy power plants. Fusion energy has great potential as energy source, and during the coming years, large experimental tokamaks* and fusion power plants will require significant volumes of advanced components.</p><p class=\"\">“The fact that we now advance the collaboration to volume production tests of tungsten tiles is an important confirmation that our E-PBF technology meets the demanding requirements in fusion energy. Tungsten is one of the most challenging materials to process, and our technology enables the production of complex components with high quality. This is an opportunity to further strengthen our position in the energy sector,\" says Daniel Gidlund, CEO of Freemelt.</p><p class=\"\">Fusion has the potential to revolutionize the energy sector. Unlike today’s nuclear power, which relies on fission (nuclear splitting), fusion does not produce long-lived radioactive waste. However, for the process to succeed, extremely high temperatures and advanced materials that can withstand the harsh conditions of the fusion environment are essential.</p><p class=\"\">Recent advancements in fusion, both internationally and through Swedish companies like Novatron, have increased the interest in the technology. Total investment in the energy sector is expected to rise from USD 300 billion in 2024 to USD 500 billion by 2030, corresponding to an annual growth rate of 7.4%. In the fusion sector, investments reached USD 7.1 billion in 2024, driven by large-scale research projects and increased private investments from companies such as Commonwealth Fusion.</p><p class=\"\">Test fusion machines like experimental tokamaks are essential for validating fusion technology before scaling to commercial electricity production. They require millions of tungsten components. ITER, the world’s largest experimental tokamak, is predicted to need between 1 and 1.5 million tungsten tiles, while smaller power plants under development by Tokamak Energy will require about 10 percent of ITER’s volume.</p><p class=\"\">UKAEA is the UK’s national organisation responsible for fusion energy development and commercialisation, driving several advanced research projects to commercialise fusion as a safe, sustainable, and emissions-free energy source. Through collaborations with industry and academia, UKAEA is driving the development of new materials and manufacturing methods required for future fusion power plants.</p><p class=\"\">*The tokamak is an experimental fusion reactor designed to harness the energy of fusion</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Capri Chief Executive John Idol says two of its key brands--Michael Kors and Versace--made missteps that contributed to an 11.6% decline in revenue and a net loss of $547 million in its third quarter. The Kors brand added too much fashion, alienating core customers. Versace removed too many unique statement items and reduced the number of lower-priced products. Idol says Kors will refocus on its heritage and plans to add a more balanced mix of products, while reducing some prices to be more in line with historical levels. Versace will add more products at the lower end of its price range to appeal to a broader base of consumers. (suzanne.kepner@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
