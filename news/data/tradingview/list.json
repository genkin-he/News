            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Uber Technologies  just took a hit, with shares sliding over 7.4% as of 11.31am today, after its latest earnings report failed to impress Wall Street. The ride-hailing giant posted solid revenue of $11.96 billion, beating expectations, but adjusted earnings of $0.23 per share fell well short of analysts' $0.50 forecast. Investors weren't thrilled with Uber's Q1 outlook eithergross bookings are expected to rise 17% to 21%, but that wasn't enough to satisfy a market that wanted stronger momentum. Add in rising costs and currency headwinds, and suddenly, a 40% jump in adjusted EBITDA wasn't enough to keep the stock afloat.</p><p class=\"\">Uber's leadership isn't sweating it. The company is doubling down on its belief that the stock is undervalued, backing it up with a $1.5 billion accelerated buyback. Free cash flow more than doubled in Q4 to $1.7 billion, giving Uber plenty of firepower to return value to shareholders. Meanwhile, the company is making big moves in self-driving techpartnering with Alphabet's Waymo to roll out autonomous taxis in Austin. But competition isn't backing down. Lyft  is coming in hot with aggressive pricing strategies, looking to chip away at Uber's dominance.</p><p class=\"\">Despite the market's reaction, Uber's fundamentals remain strong. The company is pushing ahead with automation, expanding its business-focused services, and stacking up free cash flow. Short-term volatility is part of the game, but with its market dominance and strategic bets, Uber could be setting itself up for a big comeback.</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Canada's merchandise trade balance Wednesday returned to surplus for the first time in 10 months in December, with exports growing at a much faster pace than imports, noted National Bank of Canada. </p><p class=\"\">The rise in international shipments was mainly due to two factors, said the bank. The first was a marked increase in the price of energy products (+6.0%), particularly crude oil (+9.0%), which enabled exports in this segment to reach their highest level in two years at C$16.0 billion. </p><p class=\"\">As the United States is the main destination for Canada's energy exports, it was no surprise to see the trade surplus with the U.S. reach a 30-month high of C$11.3 billion, pointed out National Bank. Whether this is good news from the point of view of Canada's negotiations with the new U.S. administration is another matter. </p><p class=\"\">The second factor behind the sharp rise in exports in December was the desire of many Canadian businesses to move their shipments ahead of the possible imposition of tariffs by the U.S., stated the bank. This same desire was probably also behind the rise in imports, as some of Canada's U.S. trading partners probably feared the imposition of retaliatory measures by Ottawa. </p><p class=\"\">The study of trade volumes on a quarterly basis suggests that international trade will make a positive contribution to gross domestic product growth in Q4Â 2024, with exports (+10.6% annualized) growing at a higher rate than imports (+9.2%), added National Bank. The decline in import volumes in the machinery equipment category (-5.9% annualized), meanwhile, suggests business equipment spending declined further in the quarter. </p><p class=\"\">For 2024 as a whole, the Canadian goods trade balance showed a C$7.2 billion deficit, the largest shortfall in four years but still smaller than what National Bank had been accustomed to in the years preceding the COVID-19 pandemic. Crucially, the goods trade balance with the U.S. narrowed a bit, moving from C$108.3 billion to a three-year low of C$102.3 billion.</p></span></div>",

The company stands on three fundamental pillars<strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">: transparency, timeliness, and trust.</strong> The upcoming name change to PawnTrust amplifies the critical pillar of trust. To reinforce these values and foster direct engagement with shareholders and the investment community, CEO Michael Farr will host a weekly \"CEO Corner\" on YouTube.

The online marketplace (www.pawntrust.com) digitizes the inventory using advanced image recognition algorithms to automate item descriptions of the participating pawn shops and markets them on a national scale. The marketplace contains cutting-edge technology that streamlines the borrowing, buying, and bartering transactions typically found at a pawn shop. The platform plans to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) to optimize pricing, reduce fraud, and create personalized search recommendations to enhance the customer's experience. These enhancements let consumers experience a frictionless shopping experience on their mobile app that gives them instant access to this nationwide inventory of pawn shops. Not only does this provide a more efficient way for consumers to shop, eliminating the need to visit multiple stores, but it also amplifies the reach of individual pawn shop owners. By joining the PawnTrust- 'Pawn Partners' network, shop owners gain access to a broader audience, enhancing their visibility and sales opportunities. This innovative approach aligns customer convenience with business growth, reshaping how people interact with the pawn industry. Consumers that purchase items outside of their local area will have their items conveniently shipped to them. As the intermediary in each transaction, PawnTrust earns a fee on every item sold in the marketplace. Many of these local pawn shops lack an online presence or the capital to market their inventory on a national scale. By bridging this gap, PawnTrust opens up opportunities for incremental sales from a wider buying base, effectively transforming the pawn shop and micro-lending industries. This model not only supports local businesses but also extends their reach, driving growth and innovation within the market.\"Â </p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Forward-Looking Information</strong></p><p class=\"\">This release includes statements that may constitute ''forward-looking'' statements, usually containing the words ''believe,'' ''estimate,'' ''project,'' ''expect'' or similar expressions.

He did not give more details.</p><p class=\"\">In June, CEO of state-owned Caixa Geral de Depositos, Paulo Macedo, said his bank, Portugal's largest, was considering \"all the hypotheses\" to buy another lender to preserve its market leadership in the face of expansion by foreign banks, particularly Spanish banks.</p><p class=\"\">Centeno was more cautious: \"Caixa is a very important bank, but that also brings responsibilities.

Those who achieve their CCIE certification are considered some of the most knowledgeable experts in the industry. That said, untangling how to study for CCIE exams can be an intimidating and complex challenge INE, a global provider of Network training and certification preparation, is releasing a pace-setting guide to achieving the CCIE certification in 40 weeks created by Brian McGahan, INEâs Director of Networking Content and once of the youngest people to ever achieve his CCIE at age 20.Â </p><p class=\"\">McGahan, CCIE #8593,Â  has achieved his CCIE certification in Security, Routing &amp; Switching, Service Provider, and Data Center, and has led thousands of students through the rigorous training required to achieve the CCIE certification. âWith this pace, you'll need roughly 40 weeks to watch all the videos, get hands-on with the labs, and review everything with quizzes.,â McGahan says. â Itâs a steady and realistic plan, and INEâs CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure Learning Path is designed to help you stay on track and make it happen.â</p><p class=\"\">McGahan recommends splitting INEâs CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure Learning Path over 40 weeks, broken down first based on the technology sections of the CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure Exam topics, followed by deep dives on core topics, then final preparation before sitting the CCIE Lab Exam.

Even if all the growth versus the midpoint of guidance came from the client segment, both areas still contributed similarly to the quarter-over-quarter growth in December. They added that it is especially disappointing considering that datacenter revenue in H1 is expected to be similar to H2Â 2024, contrary to their more optimistic view that server business was improving toward the end of 2024. </p><p class=\"\">\"Our biggest concern has been expectations in artificial intelligence, which clearly have come down closer to our level; consensus numbers for calendar year 2025 are likely to come down to our level, and we are relatively optimistic around traditional servers as well as embedded, but AI visibility likely needs to improve for the stock to find its footing,\" the analysts said. </p><p class=\"\">They added that while there may be a slowdown in the client segment at some point due to the strong 2024, it is clear that Advanced Micro Devices can continue to capture modest market share there. That being said, AI expectations still drive the stock's value, and they believe it's important to remain \"conservative\" for the 2025 calendar year, as the transition from the MI325 to MI350 models is not moving as quickly as Nvidia's shift from the H200 to Blackwell models. </p><p class=\"\">Morgan Stanley adjusted its price target on Advanced Micro Devices to $137 from $147 while keeping its equalweight rating. </p><p class=\"\">Shares fell by nearly 9% in recent trading activity.</p></span></div>",
