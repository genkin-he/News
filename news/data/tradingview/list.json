To try and boost spending the government gave some tax relief to the middle class at its annual budget on Feb. 1 but shied away from announcing big reforms which are much needed to prop up growth.</p><p class=\"\">The HSBC final India Services Purchasing Managers' Index (INPMIS=ECI), compiled by S&amp;P Global, fell to 56.5 in January from 59.3 in December, a tad lower than a preliminary estimate of 56.8 but comfortably ahead of the 50-mark separating contraction from growth.</p><p class=\"\">\"The business activity and new business PMI indices eased to their lowest levels since November 2022 and November 2023 respectively,\" said Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC.</p><p class=\"\">\"That said, new export business partly countered the downtrend and continued to rebound from a dip in late-2024, in line with official data.\"</p><p class=\"\">Demand for services rose at the slowest pace in 14 months but remained sturdy. It was supported by international demand that was the strongest in five months.</p><p class=\"\">The future activity sub-index moderated to a three-month low but the fall was insignificant and firms hired new staff at one of the fastest paces since the inception of the survey in December 2005.</p><p class=\"\">Inflationary pressures picked up, as both input costs and prices charged rose at a strong pace.</p><p class=\"\">But India's retail inflation\teased to a four-month low in December, increasing the chances of easier monetary policy. The Reserve Bank of India is widely expected to cut its key repo rate on Feb. 7, a Reuters poll taken last week showed.</p><p class=\"\">Slower services growth overshadowed a six-month high pace of expansion in the manufacturing sector (INPMI=ECI) and dragged the overall Composite PMI down to 57.7 last month from 59.2 in December.</p></span></div>",

Our innovative product solutions and patient care have a positive impact on millions of lives around the world.</p><p class=\"\">The year was marked by several milestones, most notably the establishment of Embla Medical, beginning to unite our patient care business under the ForMotion brand, and the acquisition of Fior &amp; Gentz, to name a few.</p><p class=\"\">Additionally, positive market trends such as the expanded US Medicare coverage for advanced bionic prosthetics for less mobile K2 amputees, brings potential for improved quality of life for a large patient population.</p><p class=\"\">We continue to execute well on our Growth’27 strategy delivering solid sales in line with our long-term financial ambition. For 2024, we delivered 6% organic growth driven by a strong performance in Prosthetics &amp; Neuro Orthotics and Patient Care, while growth in local currency was 9% supported by positive impact from the acquisition of Fior &amp; Gentz. Our EBITDA margin also came in strong for the year at 20% reflecting operational efficiency and effective cost control.</p><p class=\"\">In the beginning of 2024, we acquired Fior &amp; Gentz, a leading maker of transformative and innovative lower limb neuro orthotic devices for people living with neurological conditions. The acquisition is an important milestone in our growth journey, marking our expansion into the field of Neuro Orthotics. An exciting field which broadens our ability to support individuals with chronic mobility challenges. We are very pleased to see the integration progressing according to plan as we transfer product distribution to our commercial distribution network and existing O&amp;P clinics in mature, reimbursed markets.</p><p class=\"\">I am also thrilled with our progress within R&amp;D, as we launched several exciting innovations during the year. These include two new bionic knees – Icon®, a new user-friendly and versatile knee solution, and Navii®, our next generation Rheo Knee®, which comes in a fully waterproof version featuring a powerful actuator. Beyond these new knee solutions, we also launched the Pro-Flex® Terra foot, which offers increased flexibility, balance and adaptability for low-active patients. I am very proud of our ability to innovate, while addressing real patient needs.</p><p class=\"\">2024 was also the year we introduced a new unified brand identity, ForMotion, for our patient care facilities. The goal of ForMotion is to bring our network of O&amp;P clinics under a single cohesive brand. This transition will be implemented in phases, eventually encompassing our entire global network of O&amp;P patient care facilities, which currently operate under different brand names. This unified network will deliver comprehensive, modern, and innovative care while honoring the expertise and heritage unique to each location.</p><p class=\"\">Another highlight was the 2024 Paralympic Games, where a global team of elite para-athletes using Össur’s renowned prosthetics won 22 medals and set five new Paralympic records. The Paris Paralympics established new benchmarks for excellence, inclusivity, and audience engagement. Every competitor rose to the occasion, and I was fortunate to personally meet many of our inspiring athletes, who truly embody <em>Life Without Limitations</em>®.</p><p class=\"\">Lastly, we are incredibly proud to have been named one of TIME Magazine’s World’s Best Companies in Sustainable Growth 2025, an accolade that reflects our commitment to advancing a robust sustainability agenda.</p><p class=\"\">I am excited to see what the future will bring and sincerely thank our employees, customers, end-users, and shareholders for their trust and continued collaboration to improve people‘s mobility.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Sveinn Sölvason</strong></p><p class=\"\">President and CEO</p><p class=\"\">------  Ends ----- </p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Further information</strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Klaus Sindahl</strong></p><p class=\"\">Head of Investor Relations </p><p class=\"\">M: +45 5363 0134</p><p class=\"\">E: ksindahl@emblamedical.com</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Edda Heidrun Geirsdottir</strong></p><p class=\"\">VP of Corporate Communication </p><p class=\"\">M: +354 664 1055</p><p class=\"\">E: egeirsdottir@emblamedical.com</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Embla Medical press releases by e-mail</strong></p><p class=\"\">If you wish to receive Embla Medical press releases by e-mail, please register at http://www.emblamedical.com/investors</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Embla Medical</strong></p><p class=\"\">Embla Medical (Nasdaq Copenhagen: EMBLA) was founded in Reykjavik in 1971 with the mission to improve people's mobility.
