            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">China's retaliation against U.S. tariffs has been calibrated to send a message to Washington--and domestic audiences--without inflicting too much damage, Capital Economics says. \"But there is a risk that retaliation backfires by encouraging Trump to escalate tariffs further,\" says Julian Evans-Pritchard. CE calculates that the countermeasures target, at most, $20 billion of annual imports versus the more than $450 billion of Chinese goods in the crosshairs. China also announced nontariff moves, such as a probe into Google. For the most part, these are warnings that it will harm U.S. interests if needed but still give the option to walk the measures back, he says. Beijing presumably hopes it can reach a deal with Trump, but U.S.-China grievances run deep, making de-escalation challenging. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">(TheNewswire)</p><p class=\"\">February 4, 2025 – TheNewswire- Vancouver, Canada – Golden Cariboo ResourcesLtd. (the “Company”)   (WKN:A402CQ) (FSE:3TZ)wishes to announce a significant extension to the Halo zone in drillhole QGQ24-18, which intersected 172.6 m (566.3 ft) of 0.43 g/t goldnear surface from a depth of 10.4 m (34.1 ft), including intersectionscontaining 26.3 m (86.3 ft) of 0.88 g/t gold and 20.0 m (65.6 ft) of1.17 g/t gold. Core recovery in the 26.3 m interval was only 47% (seeTable 1 below), which could result in overall lower values due to theloss of mineralized soft sulphide bearing, brecciated, fracturedand/or altered intervals. The 172.6 m intersection extends goldmineralization 60 m from the drill hole QGQ24-13 collar (see Figure 1enclosed and on the Company website www.goldencariboo.com), and extendsgold mineralization vertically by 125 m (410.1 ft) below surface,which returned up to 5.15 g/t gold in outcrop (see News Release dated December 3,2024 and Figure 2 enclosed). A deeperintersection of gold mineralization in QGQ24-18 was also encountered,which returned 19.22 m (63.1 m) of 0.45 g/t gold from 351.66 m (1153.7ft).</p><p class=\"\">Drill hole QGQ24-18, set up at an azimuth of035° and inclination of -45°, was the thirddrill hole completed following the Halo Discovery in holes QGQ24-13 to-15, with an objective to extend mineralization and enhance theunderstanding of the lithological, structural and vein geometries ofthe Discovery. Lithological contacts trend southeast with a steepsouthwest dip, while quartz-carbonate+/-pyrite veins with observedvisible gold occur both parallel and oblique to lithological contacts.Subsequent drill holes QGQ24-19 and QGQ24-20 were drilled in anortherly orientation in approximately 100 m step-outs to extend theHalo Discovery, have been previously announced to contain broad zonesof quartz veining with visible gold (see News Release dated November 26,2024), and assay results are pending.</p><p class=\"\">Golden Cariboo’s President and CEO, Frank Callaghan,stated “Drill hole QGQ24-18 represents another strong follow up tothe Discovery made this past summer, and reinforces our growingconfidence in the Halo zone’s potential. The broad intercepts ofgold mineralization, shallow overburden cover, shallow topography, andlocation approximately 4 kilometers from a major highway in centralBC, demonstrates the exceptional nature of this Discovery.”</p><p class=\"\">Table 1: Reported gold intercepts for QGQ24-18</p><div class=\"tableWrapper-pIO_GYwT\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td

These Miercom results validate our exceptional ability to not only accurately detect and block new malware and critical events, but also to provide the best cyber security product quality to customers, year after year.”</p><p class=\"\">This year, Miercom introduced an important firewall comparison to reflect the quality of cyber security products, by assessing their vulnerability to being hacked.

This latest innovation builds on the success of Jabra’s PanaCast 50 VBS, bringing the same powerful performance to smaller spaces in a more compact and cost-effective package.</p><p class=\"\">As more organizations transition back to the office and hybrid work environments become the norm, the demand for efficient small meeting space solutions continues to grow. These spaces often pose unique challenges for video collaboration, as traditional solutions struggle to capture all participants equally—particularly those seated closer to the screen—while some lack video conferencing equipment altogether. This imbalance can result in empty meeting rooms and gaps in communication, underscoring the need for solutions that provide clear, inclusive experiences for everyone, regardless of location.</p><p class=\"\">The PanaCast 40 VBS bridges this gap by delivering an all-in-one solution that transforms small meeting rooms into high-performing collaboration hubs. With its wide field of view, exceptional audio quality, and seamless usability, the PanaCast 40 VBS ensures every participant is seen and heard clearly, enabling organizations to fully utilize their small spaces and bring collaboration to new heights.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Redefining collaboration for small spaces</strong></p><p class=\"\">Globally, less than 3% of small meeting spaces, or huddle rooms, are video enabled*, leaving millions of these rooms underutilized and underserved. The PanaCast 40 VBS addresses this challenge with its innovative dual-camera systems, delivering a seamless 180-degree field of view through advanced stitching technology. This ensures full room coverage, making every participant clearly visible on video.</p><p class=\"\">The video capabilities are matched by the advanced audio performance, which stems from the GN group-wide unique sound processing capabilities. The sound is powered by a single high-quality speaker and six microphones with adaptive beamforming. Intelligent audio algorithms enhance sound clarity for exceptional voice pickup, so every word is heard clearly and accurately, fostering more natural and engaging virtual interactions and ensuring remote participants feel fully included.</p><p class=\"\">The PanaCast 40 VBS reimagines what’s possible for huddle rooms, transforming small spaces into comfortable collaboration areas and allowing facility managers to unlock the full potential of these underutilized spaces.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Designed for ease of use and rapid deployment</strong></p><p class=\"\">Designed with simplicity and ease of use at its core, the PanaCast 40 VBS offers a straightforward installation process—from unboxing to mounting to the first meeting. Its intuitive setup ensures that even first-time customers can get their systems up and running in seconds, making collaboration effortless.</p><p class=\"\">New packaging enhances the deployment experience further by allowing provisioning without the need to remove the product from the box. The design also features easy cable routing, reducing installation time. The PanaCast 40 VBS is ideal for quick and easy installations in small rooms, such as Express Install for Microsoft Teams Rooms.<em>  </em></p><p class=\"\">It also ensures a consistent and seamless experience for small meeting spaces by sharing many of the same accessories as its medium room counterpart, the PanaCast 50 VBS. This enables simplified operations for administrators and flexibility across different room sizes, making the PanaCast 40 VBS a versatile and efficient solution for modern office needs.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">A future-proof investment </strong></p><p class=\"\">The PanaCast 40 VBS is built to adapt to the evolving needs of modern workplaces, particularly for small Android environments. With its certified compatibility for Android environments, it offers flexibility with Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and BYOD deployment options.</p><p class=\"\">To enhance usability and longevity, the PanaCast 40 VBS includes optional accessories such as a touch controller and a detachable faceplate for easy cleaning. It can also be purchased as a bundle, with both the PanaCast 40 VBS and the touch controller included. Seamless integration with ecosystem partners ensures a future-proof investment, complemented by up-to-date manageability through Jabra+ software and the reassurance of Jabra Warranty+ services.</p><p class=\"\">Holger Reisinger, SVP Enterprise Video Business Unit at Jabra said: “The modern workplace is undergoing a transformation, with organizations reimagining how their spaces can drive productivity and collaboration. Small rooms, phone booths and huddle spaces are a cornerstone of this evolution, yet they’ve often been overlooked by traditional video solutions. With the PanaCast 40 VBS, we’re addressing this gap by delivering a flexible, intuitive, and future-proof Android solution that empowers teams to collaborate seamlessly, regardless of room size or platform preference.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Key features of the PanaCast 40 VBS include:</strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Full-room coverage – 180-degree field-of-view with dual cameras and 4x digital zoom</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Superior audio – 1 speaker and 6 microphones, enhanced by intelligent audio algorithms for crystal-clear sound and voice pickup</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Streamlined setup – New packaging enables provisioning without removing the product from the box</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Consistent experience – Shared touch controller and stand with the PanaCast 50 VBS medium room solution for seamless integration across spaces</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Effortless installation – Simplified cable routing and protection for easy, clean setup</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Flexible deployment – Compatible with Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and BYOD setups</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">MDEP-based solution (Microsoft Device Ecosystem Platform) – Delivers strengthened security and enhanced meeting experiences</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Intelligent Meeting Space – Enables users to personalize and set virtual meeting space boundaries – perfect for open-plan offices or glass-walled rooms</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Always up to date – Managed via Jabra+, ensuring the latest features and functionality</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Reliability – Backed by Jabra Warranty+ for added peace of mind</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Modern design – Clean, professional aesthetic that fits seamlessly into contemporary workspaces</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Practical features – Easy-clean cover and ADA compliance for enhanced usability</li></ul><p class=\"\">Jabra PanaCast 40 VBS will be available from Mid-2025.

Central to this innovation is GN's unique human approach to AI, which models the brain's natural sound processing capability to create voice clarity in complex listening environments. GN's Intelligent Focus feature is distinctive in its ability to respond to the direction a person is looking, ensuring the AI enhances sounds based on the user's natural response to their environment. GN’s proprietary technology provides a more natural and effortless listening experience, even in challenging situations like noisy restaurants or crowded venues.</p><p class=\"\">A new, dedicated Deep Neural Network (DNN) chip enables the superior listening experience. This DNN-powered solution is up to 17 times more efficient than other leading hearing solutions with directionality and DNN noise reduction, resulting in a significant improvement to speech understanding.1 Trained on 13.5 million spoken sentences in various languages and with varied vocal effort, across 3.9 million tuned sound parameters, the DNN can perform 4.9 trillion operations per day to spotlight speech and reduce background noise.</p><p class=\"\">Studies show ReSound Vivia offers the world's best hearing in noise experience, with 64% of users experiencing improved hearing in noisy environments compared to other AI hearing solutions, so they can enjoy conversations with greater ease and understanding.1</p><p class=\"\">All of this advanced technology is packed into the world's smallest AI hearing aid, the ReSound Vivia microRIE. The microRIE style offers 30 hours wear on one battery charge and 20 hours of use for a typical day using a combination of Intelligent Focus and streaming.2 This all-day power ensures users can enjoy uninterrupted hearing and seamless connectivity without compromise.</p><p class=\"\">Brian Dam Pedersen, Chief Technology Officer, Head of Research and Technology at GN, explains: <!-- -->“With ReSound Vivia, we've fundamentally reimagined how AI can enhance the hearing experience. Our unique Intelligent Focus feature mimics natural human behavior, allowing the AI to prioritize sounds based on where the user is looking, not just how loud they are. This creates a far more intuitive and natural listening experience, seamlessly integrating with the user's own perception of their environment. It's not just about amplifying sound; it's about intelligently enhancing the sounds that matter most. And we are not stopping here – all the knowledge, capabilities, and research we have acquired will be applied across other GN products and projects, furthering innovation across the Group.\"</p><p class=\"\">Recognizing the importance of accessibility, GN is launching ReSound Savi to ensure that even more people with hearing loss can experience the latest in connectivity innovation. Both ReSound Vivia and ReSound Savi support Bluetooth LE Audio, including Auracast broadcast audio, the state-of-the-art low-energy connectivity feature. Building on a legacy of seamless connectivity, more people than ever will enjoy new streaming and communication opportunities in public places such as theaters, airports, restaurants, and arenas.  </p><p class=\"\">As part of these launches, GN also introduces the world’s first app which integrates an Auracast Assistant for hearing aids. Connecting to Auracast is now as simple as a single tap in the ReSound Smart 3D™ app. This streamlined process simplifies selecting Auracast streams, even with smartphones and devices that don’t yet have an Auracast assistant built in.</p><p class=\"\">Scott Davis, Hearing division President at GN, describes: <!-- -->\"ReSound Vivia and ReSound Savi represent a significant leap forward. Now you can have it all with ReSound Vivia, which combines world leading sound quality, all-day battery life, and the smallest size on the market for discretion and comfort, so users can hear their best without compromise. With ReSound Savi, we're making our cutting-edge connectivity, including Bluetooth LE Audio and Auracast, accessible to a wider audience. These two product lines demonstrate GN's unwavering commitment to delivering innovation that brings people closer to each other and the things they love to do.\"</p><p class=\"\">GN understands the challenges and specific needs of hearing care professionals. This is why, alongside the launch of ReSound Vivia and ReSound Savi, GN is introducing improvements to fitting software, alignment of domes and receivers for optimal comfort and acoustic performance across the portfolio, and exchangeable mic filters for easy care that improves hygiene and device longevity. These enhancements are designed to streamline clinic workflow, improve fitting accuracy, and ultimately enhance the user experience.</p><p class=\"\">The new ReSound Vivia hearing aids are available in a microRIE rechargeable and two non-rechargeable RIE models, including a CROS model in the microRIE style - all in a wide variety of colors - including the new and elegant Navy Blue and Red. ReSound Savi is available in a new miniRIE rechargeable and two non-rechargeable RIE models in five modern colors.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Andrew Bary</p><p class=\"\">A battle could soon play out in Delaware courts between a group of institutional investors in Endeavor Group Holdings and Silver Lake, the tech investment firm, over Silver Lake's deal to buy out public shareholders for $27.50 a share in cash.</p><p class=\"\">Endeavor, which is led by Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel, counts as its most valuable asset a majority stake in TKO Group Holdings, which owns UFC (Ultimate Fight Championship) and WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment).</p><p class=\"\">Since the $13 billion, take-private deal was unveiled in April 2024, TKO's stock has surged almost 75% to $157 and the value of the TKO embedded in each Endeavor share has risen to nearly $40 a share from $20. There is roughly 0.25 share of TKO embedded in each Endeavor share, based on Wall Street estimates including one from Citigroup analyst Jason Bazinet in a report from December.</p><p class=\"\">Endeavor shares were down 0.5% Monday to $30.44 but trade above the deal price with the transaction expected to close by the end of the current quarter. TKO stock gained 1.2% to $157.05.</p><p class=\"\">Endeavor has other assets including a sports and talent management business including WME (whose core includes the former William Morris Agency) that could be worth another few dollars a share, putting the total value of the company comfortably above $40 a share, according to Roy Behren, co-president of Westchester Capital, which runs the $2 billion Merger Fund, an owner of Endeavor stock.</p><p class=\"\">\"There will be tons of shareholders seeking appraisal,\" he says. \"This is one of the most popular trades in the merger and event-driven community. This is a really unfair transaction for public shareholders,\" Behren says.</p><p class=\"\">As it now stands, Silver Lake and the Endeavor management participating in the take-private deal stand to reap a $6 billion windfall from the rise in TKO stock since the deal was announced last April.</p><p class=\"\">Many Endeavor shareholders want a share of that windfall.</p><p class=\"\">The way it works is that Endeavor holders who feel the takeover price of $27.50 a share undervalues the company can seek appraisal rights in Delaware Chancery Court and ask a judge to grant them more than $27.50 a share. The courts can grant investors more or less than the deal price depending on the judge's ruling.</p><p class=\"\">The deadline for submitting appraisal rights is believed to be Tuesday, Feb. 4, based on a long Endeavor filing in January where it stated the deadline would be 20 days from Jan. 15.</p><p class=\"\">Shareholders who don't plan to seek appraisal rights may want to consider selling their shares because Endeavor stock may fall towards $27.50 after the appraisal deadline.</p><p class=\"\">Silver Lake told Barron's recently in a statement: \"We believe the transaction price is fair and will not increase it.\" Silver Lake declined to comment further and Endeavor had no comment.</p><p class=\"\">A who's who of leading risk-arbitrage and special-situations investors hold Endeavor.</p><p class=\"\">The largest outside investor is Troluce Capital Advisors which recently boosted its stake to 35.5 million shares, a roughly 8% stake in the company. Other holders include Pentwater Capital, a well-regarded firm that engages in takeover arbitrage; and Millennium Management, the multi-strategy firm headed by billionaire Israel (Izzy) Englander. Barron's counts at least 80 million shares — roughly a third of the estimated public float of about 240 million shares, that may seek appraisal rights.</p><p class=\"\">Most of the shareholder holdings are as of Sept. 30, 2024, and it is estimated that more Endeavor shares have since migrated to institutional holders who may exercise appraisal rights. There will be a better sense of the appraisal landscape once big investors release their Dec. 31 holdings around Feb. 14.</p><p class=\"\">The little-known appraisal process isn't normally pursued by investors because of the time and expense involved — a complex process that can take two to three years. It can be tough for individual investors. An Endeavor filing in January states that \"failure to precisely follow\" statutory rules on appraisal rights could doom an investor's ability to pursue them.</p><p class=\"\">In these proceeding, investors argue that the deal price has short-changed them and they often bring experts to buttress their case while a company maintains otherwise. A Delaware Chancery Court judge then renders a decision and investors can get more or less than the deal price.</p><p class=\"\">The key date for determining fairness is the closing date of the transaction, according to a 2022 article by Skadden Arps lawyers and the language of Endeavor's recent filing supports that. This should benefit investors seeking appraisal rights since Endeavor is worth considerably more now than in April 2024 due to the rally in TKO shares.</p><p class=\"\">Often, appraisal cases boil down to dueling estimates of a company's value based on discounted cash flow analysis, which is subjective. But with Endeavor, investors seeking the appraisal rights can point to the easily measurable value of TKO stock. Silver Lake could argue that the TKO stock should be adjusted downward for any taxes that shareholders might incur in a potential distribution.</p><p class=\"\">Another issue that the Delaware courts may weigh in fairness.</p><p class=\"\">While the deal got approval of the Endeavor board, public shareholders weren't given a vote on the transaction.</p><p class=\"\">Such a vote is considered to be good governance and has been regularly employed by control shareholders like media mogul John Malone in deals. In these situations, deals are contingent on the support of the majority of public shareholders unaffiliated with the control holder. The lack of such a vote could help those seeking appraisal rights.</p><p class=\"\">In the Endeavor situation, key management members led by Ari Emanuel will participate in the deal with Silver Lake. Management owns 49 million shares while Silver Lake holds 174 million out of a total of around 470 million.</p><p class=\"\">What obligation does management owe to public holders? It is tough to argue that the current price is fair to holders. As a result, it's possible that the Endeavor board and management may be sued by shareholders for breaching fiduciary obligations to investors.</p><p class=\"\">One plus for shareholders seeking appraisal rights is that they are entitled to get paid interest at five percentage points above a key short rate — resulting in a rate of about 9% from the date the deal closes until a judge's ruling. Given this high rate, some companies make partial payment to those seeking appraisal rights soon after the deal closes, enabling them to save on interest costs.</p><p class=\"\">So what may happen? It's possible that despite its insistence otherwise that Silver Lake boosts the value of its offer for Endeavor in an effort to dissuade investors from seeking appraisal. Silver Lake could stand pat, betting that the potential cost of appraisals is less than paying all public holders more than $27.50. It's also possible that Silver Lake tries to cut a deal with shareholders seeking appraisal rights.</p><p class=\"\">It promises to be an eventful few months for Endeavor and its shareholders. Key events to watch are the disclosure of investor holdings of the company on Feb. 14 and any potential statements from big holders on their intentions.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Andrew Bary at andrew.bary@barrons.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
