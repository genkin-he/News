To date, this technology appears to be making some of the strongest companies, stronger, and to that end we maintained positions in many of the largest AI beneficiaries including NVIDIA, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta Platforms. This group remains a cornerstone of our portfolio, and as of year-end more than half of the portfolio’s assets are invested across the Technology Sector as a whole.

However, gold equities underperformed the gold price. Recently the rise in the gold price has not been fully reflected in the profit margins of gold mining companies. This has largely been due to cost pressures emanating from a variety of sources, exacerbated by covid. But we believe the market may be too pessimistic concerning both cost pressures which are diminishing and enhanced revenues from a higher gold price. Gold equities are inexpensive relative to their history and on an absolute basis. But a catalyst is needed to alter investor perception. This could be gold backed ETFs adding ounces reflecting a recovery in investor interest in the sector, a decline in other asset markets which may highlight gold as a portfolio diversifier, increased takeover activity or simply continued strength in the gold price. Some of our smaller gold producers such as Lundin Gold and Wesdome Gold Mines, had stellar returns. Among our larger producers Kinross and Agnico Eagle contributed significantly to performance. We continue to favor mid capitalization gold producers with good assets that trade at a big discount to some of the larger producers.”</p><p class=\"\"><em><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">The Gabelli Small Cap Growth Fund</strong></em></p><p class=\"\">We utilize our own in-house team of over 40 industry equity analysts and portfolio managers to analyze the stocks in the fund, using our bottom-up research-intensive process and, more importantly, our accumulated and compounded knowledge of selected industry sectors.

You can identify these statements because they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” and other words and terms of similar meaning. They also appear in any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, future performance of our products, expenses, the outcome of any legal proceedings, and financial results. Although we believe that we are basing our expectations and beliefs on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of what we currently know about our business and operations, the economy, and other conditions, there can be no assurance that our actual results will not differ materially from what we expect or believe. Therefore, you should proceed with caution in relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance.</p><p class=\"\">Forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors, some of which are listed below, that are difficult to predict and could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ from our expectations include risks associated with the duration and scope of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic resulting in volatile market conditions, a decline in the securities markets that adversely affect our assets under management, negative performance of our products, the failure to perform as required under our investment management agreements, and a general downturn in the economy that negatively impacts our operations. We also direct your attention to the more specific discussions of these and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors contained in our Annual Report and other public filings. Other factors that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We do not undertake to update publicly any forward-looking statements if we subsequently learn that we are unlikely to achieve our expectations whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.</p><p class=\"\">Gabelli Funds, LLC is a registered investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission and is a wholly owned subsidiary of GAMCO Investors, Inc.

Traditional ETFs tell the public what assets they hold each day. These ETFs do not. This may create additional risks for your investment. For example:</p><p class=\"\">• You may have to pay more money to trade the ETFs’ shares. These ETFs will provide less information to traders, who tend to charge more for trades when they have less information. </p><p class=\"\">• The price you pay to buy ETF shares on an exchange may not match the value of an ETF’s portfolio. The same is true when you sell shares. These price differences may be greater for these ETFs compared to other ETFs because they provide less information to traders. </p><p class=\"\">• These additional risks may be even greater in challenging or uncertain market conditions. </p><p class=\"\">• The differences between these ETFs and other ETFs may also have advantages. By keeping certain information about the ETFs undisclosed, these ETFs may face less risk that other traders can predict or copy its investment strategy. This may improve the ETFs’ performance. If other traders are able to copy or predict the ETFs’ investment strategies, however, this may hurt the ETFs’ performance. For additional information regarding the unique attributes and risks of these ETFs, see the ActiveShares prospectus/registration statement. </p><p class=\"\">You should consider the ETFs’ investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before you invest.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\"><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.barchart.com/investing-ideas/ai-stocks?viewName=performance\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Artificial intelligence (AI)</a> has been a game-changer for businesses, fueling innovation and transforming industries at an unprecedented pace. Over the past year, companies have scrambled to integrate this revolutionary technology, unlocking new efficiencies, enhancing customer experiences, and redefining competitive landscapes. From automating workflows to supercharging data analytics, AI has become the secret weapon for growth, and those who embrace it are reaping the rewards.</p><p class=\"\">While the spotlight often shines on AI powerhouses like Nvidia , Alphabet , Microsoft , or Apple , some lesser-known players are quietly making waves, and one of them is BigBear.ai Holdings . Specializing in <a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.barchart.com/story/news/30475827/up-130-in-6-months-is-penny-stock-bigbear-ai-still-a-buy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">AI-powered decision intelligence</a>, BigBear.ai is carving out a niche in national security, supply chain optimization, and digital identity, areas where AI-driven insights are becoming mission-critical.</p><p class=\"\">As businesses and governments double down on AI to enhance operations, improve security, and streamline decision-making, demand for BigBear.ai’s solutions is poised to climb. In fact, the company has recently wooed investors after <a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.barchart.com/story/news/30693514/why-bigbearai-stock-is-skyrocketing-today\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">securing a major contract</a> under the U.S. Department of Navy’s SeaPort Next Generation (SeaPort NxG) program, reinforcing its credibility and growth prospects. Thus, with its expanding footprint in high-growth sectors and a fresh government contract signaling momentum, is now the time to bet on this rising AI penny stock?</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About BigBear.ai Stock</strong></p><p class=\"\">Maryland-based BigBear.ai Holdings  is at the forefront of AI-powered decision intelligence, delivering cutting-edge solutions for national security, digital identity, and supply chain management. In an era where real-time insights are critical, the company’s advanced AI and predictive analytics serve defense and intelligence agencies, border protection, transportation security, manufacturing, logistics, and even travel and entertainment, helping organizations and government agencies to navigate complex, high-stakes environments with confidence.</p><p class=\"\">With a market capitalization of around $1.1 billion, this penny stock has been on an absolute tear, delivering a staggering 199% gain over the past year, leaving the broader S&amp;P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 20.9% return in the dust. The momentum has only intensified in the past six months, with the stock soaring 264%, crushing the SPX’s 12.1% gain over the same period. As investors chase high-growth AI plays, this under-the-radar stock is proving to be a breakout winner. </p><p class=\"\">Following the stock’s meteoric rise over the recent months, BBAI presently trades at 5.74 times sales, edging past the sector median of 3.30x, signaling investor confidence in the company’s AI-driven growth potential and expanding market presence.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">A Closer Look at BigBear.ai’s Q3 Financials</strong></p><p class=\"\">The company disclosed its third-quarter earnings report on Nov. 5, which revealed 22% year-over growth in sales to $41.5 million. However, while top-line growth is accelerating, profitability remains a key challenge. The company reported a gross margin of just 25.9%, a figure that lags behind typical AI software businesses.</p><p class=\"\">Furthermore, the company’s bottom line took a hit in Q3, posting a loss of $0.05 per share. Despite being better than Wall Street’s forecast loss per share of $0.07, the reported loss marks a stark reversal from the $0.03 profit per share registered in the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, BigBear.ai’s backlog, which stood at a solid $437 million as of Sep. 30, 2024, signals strong future demand.</p><p class=\"\">While reflecting on BigBear.ai’s Q3 performance, former CEO Mandy Long emphasized the company’s steady progress in building a long-term, sustainable business backed by solid cash reserves. However, she acknowledged that regulatory caution toward AI continues to create hurdles, leading to uneven growth.</p><p class=\"\">Despite these challenges, BigBear.ai remains focused on navigating the complexities of the AI landscape with a strategic and measured approach. Looking forward to fiscal 2024, management anticipates revenue to land between $165 million and $180 million.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">BigBear.ai Secures Key U.S. Navy Contract</strong></p><p class=\"\">On Jan. 30, shares of BigBear.ai closed up more than 13% after the company landed a prime Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under the U.S. Department of Navy’s SeaPort Next Generation (SeaPort NxG) program, a major win that reinforces its standing in national security. As the U.S. Navy’s premier contracting platform, SeaPort NxG streamlines procurement for technical, engineering, and professional services, giving BigBear.ai a direct avenue to deliver mission-critical AI solutions to the Navy and other federal agencies.</p><p class=\"\">Newly appointed CEO Kevin McAleenan emphasized the company’s commitment to strengthening national defense, viewing the contract as a testament to BigBear.ai’s cutting-edge capabilities. With this award, BigBear.ai is poised to provide advanced systems engineering and specialized technology solutions, further solidifying its reputation as a trusted AI partner for the defense sector.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">What Do Analysts Expect for BigBear.ai Stock?</strong></p><p class=\"\">While the coverage is light, Wall Street appears largely bullish on BBAI stock, maintaining a consensus rating of “Strong Buy.” Of the four analysts offering recommendations, three advise a “Strong Buy,” and the remaining one analyst maintains a “Hold.” The average analyst price target of $4.33 indicates only 2.4% potential upside. However, the Street-high price target of $7 suggests that BBAI could rally as much as 65.5% from here. </p><p class=\"\"><em> On the date of publication, Anushka Mukherji did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Merck said it expects 2025 adjusted earnings of $8.88 to $9.03 a share, below consensus of $9.21.</p><p class=\"\">Pfizer was down 1.9%. The company reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 63 cents a share, beating analysts' forecasts of 46 cents, and the company reaffirmed guidance for 2025.</p><p class=\"\">PayPal declined 12%. The fintech beat fourth-quarter earnings and sales estimates, and said total payment volume rose 7% in the quarter, while payment transactions decreased 3%.</p><p class=\"\">Estée Lauder, the luxury beauty brand, slumped 16% after it issued weak earnings guidance, said it expects to cut between 5,800 and 7,000 positions as part of a two-year restructuring plan, and would record more than $1 billion in pretax charges on employee-related costs.</p><p class=\"\">Ferrari was up 7.7% after the Italian supercar maker reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and revenue.</p><p class=\"\">Clorox reported a 15% drop in fiscal second-quarter sales to $1.69 billion, and said it now expects fiscal-year sales to fall 1% to 2%, down from a prior outlook for sales to be flat to down 2%. Shares of the cleaning-products maker were down 6.6%.</p><p class=\"\">Earnings reports are expected after the closing bell Tuesday from Alphabet, Advanced Micro Devices, Chipotle Mexican Grill, and Amgen.</p><p class=\"\">Alphabet rose 1.9% ahead of fourth-quarter earnings from the parent of Google.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil weakened on Tuesday as China retaliated for a 10% tariff imposed on its imports into the United States, a day after Donald Trump's threats to impose levies on Canada and Mexico's exports to the country were postponed for 30 days. </p><p class=\"\">WTI crude oil for March delivery closed down US$0.46 to settle at US$72.70 per barrel, while April Brent crude was last seen up US$0.27 to US$76.23. </p><p class=\"\">Prices initially jumped on Monday as the Trump Administration promised to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico beginning on Tuesday, with a 10% levy on energy imports from Canada, which supplies 20% of U.S. oil demand. Trump on Monday agreed to postpone the measures on both countries for 30 days in exchange for heightened border security measures. </p><p class=\"\">\"Crude oil initially surged on concerns over Canadian supply but quickly reversed lower after a one-month tariff delay and escalating trade tensions between the US and China - both major energy consumers. This underscores the market's sensitivity to policy shifts and demand uncertainty,\" Saxo Bank wrote. </p><p class=\"\">Still, the U.S. administration went ahead with 10% tariffs for imports from China, with China retaliating with targeted tariffs of up to 15% and export controls on strategic materials, including tungsten and tellurium. </p><p class=\"\">\"While we expect the market to continue reacting positively to the North American developments, it will be interesting to gauge sentiment as the market parses potential impacts from Asia (as well as any negotiations that may occur over the coming days),\" Tudor, Pickering, Holt analyst Jake Roberts noted. </p><p class=\"\">OPEC+ on Monday held a ministerial meeting that ended with an agreement to stick with its plans to begin returning 2.2-million barrels per day of voluntary production cuts by increasing supply by 122,000 bpd monthly beginning in April, while keeping other quota cuts in place through next year despite Donald Trump's demands the group raise output to lower oil prices. </p><p class=\"\">\"OPEC decided to stick to its guns and keep the output quotas in place until the end of 2026 and gradually unwind the 2.2 mbpd of voluntary constraints from April, this year. Don't hold your breath until Donald Trump is content with the OPEC+ strategy but should the export tariffs on Canadian and Mexican oil be re-introduced further down the line and prices strengthen again, the tapering might just take place. In case of a price drop and another delay in easing output restrictions, Mr Trump's patience will be severely tested,\" PVM Oil Associates noted.</p></span></div>",
