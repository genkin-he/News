The company's U.S. business jumped 52% from a year earlier. \"Our business results continue to astound, demonstrating our deepening position at the center of the (artificial intelligence) revolution. Our early insights surrounding the commoditization of large-language models have evolved from theory to fact,\" said CEO Alex Karp. For the first quarter, Palantir said it expects revenue of $858 million to $862 million, up 36% from 2024 at the midpoint, and better than Wall Street estimates of $799 million.</p><p class=\"\">Tesla  was up 0.9% after shares of the electric-vehicle maker slumped 5.2% on Monday. The stock closed lower after it was announced that tariffs levied on Mexico by the U.S. would be delayed by a month but before President Donald Trump struck a similar deal with Canada. Tesla makes all its EVs for the U.S. market in the U.S., but about 15% of the parts in a Model Y sold in the U.S. come from Mexico.</p><p class=\"\">Shares of Nvidia, the leading maker of artificial-intelligence chips, were up 2.2%.  Nvidia declined 2.8% on Monday as Wall Street gauged the potential effects of the Trump administration's tariffs on chip companies, and amid continued worries over AI advancements made by China's DeepSeek.</p><p class=\"\">Super Micro Computer rose 9.7%. The maker of AI servers said it would be providing a fiscal second-quarter \" business update\" on Feb. 11. The Nasdaq Stock Market told the company in November that it wasn't in compliance with a listing rule requiring timely filing of reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In early December, the company said it expected to file its delayed financial statements by Feb. 25.</p><p class=\"\">PepsiCo posted fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.96, beating analysts' estimates for $1.94, but the stock fell 1.8% after revenue declined 0.2% from a year earlier to $27.78 billion, and missed expectations of $27.89 billion. Shares fell 4.6%.</p><p class=\"\">Shares of Spotify Technology jumped 12% after the audio-streaming company added more premium subscribers in the fourth quarter than Wall Street expected, helping revenue top estimates.</p><p class=\"\">Merck fell 10% after the drug maker reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings that beat analysts' estimates but provided guidance that missed expectations. Merck said it expects 2025 adjusted earnings per share of $8.88 to $9.03, below consensus for $9.21.</p><p class=\"\">Pfizer was down 1.6%. The pharmaceutical company reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 63 cents, beating analysts' forecasts of 46 cents, and reaffirmed guidance for 2025. Shares fell Tuesday after a Senate panel voted to advance the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to serve as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p class=\"\">PayPal Holdings declined 12%. The fintech beat fourth-quarter earnings and sales estimates, and said total payment volume rose 7% in the quarter, while payment transactions decreased 3%.</p><p class=\"\">Estée Lauder slumped 16% after the luxury beauty brand issued weak earnings guidance, announced it would eliminate thousands of positions as part of a two-year restructuring plan, and record more than $1 billion in pretax charges on employee-related costs.</p><p class=\"\">Ferrari was up 6.6% after the Italian supercar maker reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and revenue.</p><p class=\"\">Clorox reported a 15% drop in fiscal second-quarter sales to $1.69 billion, and said it now expects fiscal-year sales to fall 1% to 2%, down from a prior outlook for sales to be flat to down 2%. Shares of the cleaning-products maker were down 7%.</p><p class=\"\">Earnings reports are expected after the closing bell Tuesday from Alphabet, Advanced Micro Devices, Chipotle Mexican Grill, and Amgen.</p><p class=\"\">Alphabet stock rose 2% ahead of fourth-quarter earnings from the parent company of Google. Wall Street expects Alphabet to report earnings of $2.13 a share on revenue of $96.7 billion, up from per-share profit of $1.64 on revenue of $86.3 billion a year earlier.

For the fourth quarter of 2024, revenue was $912.0 million, net income attributable to ChampionX was $82.8 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $212.3 million. Income before income taxes margin was 13.0%, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.3%. Cash provided by operating activities was $207.3 million, and free cash flow was $170.1 million.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">CEO Commentary</strong></p><p class=\"\">“2024 was a year in which we continued to demonstrate the unique nature of ChampionX’s cash flow resiliency, driven by the strength of our high-margin operating model and capital-light portfolio of businesses. We delivered robust adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and generated strong free cash flow. Our differentiated performance is the direct result of our employees around the world remaining committed to serving our customers well and living our continuous improvement culture daily. I am thankful and humbled to lead such a remarkably dedicated team,” ChampionX’s President and Chief Executive Officer Sivasankaran “Soma” Somasundaram said.</p><p class=\"\">“During the fourth quarter of 2024, we generated revenue of $912 million, which increased 1% sequentially, driven by seasonal strength in our Production Chemical Technologies business. Sequential growth in Production Chemical Technologies was offset by typical seasonal declines in our Production &amp; Automation Technologies business into the year-end holidays. For the full year 2024, we generated revenue of $3.6 billion, and we grew our North America revenue by 3% year-over-year, driven by particular strength in the Permian basin. We generated net income attributable to ChampionX of $83 million, income before income taxes margin of 13.0%, and delivered adjusted EBITDA of $212 million, representing a 23.3% adjusted EBITDA margin, our highest level as ChampionX, which speaks to the continued productivity and profitability focus of our team. For the full year 2024, we generated net income attributable to ChampionX of $320 million, income before income taxes margin of 12.2%, a 90 basis point increase over the prior year, and delivered adjusted EBITDA of $785 million, representing a 21.6% adjusted EBITDA margin, an increase of 107 basis points year-over-year.</p><p class=\"\">“We once again demonstrated our strong cash flow profile. Cash flow from operating activities was $207 million during the fourth quarter, which represented 250% of net income attributable to ChampionX, and includes a $48 million tax payment deferred from the fourth quarter of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025. We generated robust free cash flow of $170 million during the fourth quarter, converting 80% of our adjusted EBITDA for the period. Cash flow from operating activities was $590 million for the full year 2024, which represented 184% of net income attributable to ChampionX. For the full year 2024, we generated free cash flow of $460 million and achieved 59% adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow conversion. Our balance sheet and financial position remain strong, ending the year with approximately $1.2 billion of liquidity, including $508 million of cash and $675 million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility.</p><p class=\"\">“As we look ahead to 2025, we expect global oil production to grow, and given our differentiated and resilient production-oriented portfolio, we expect another year of positive performance relative to general oil and gas market activity.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Agreement to be Acquired by SLB</strong></p><p class=\"\">On April 2, 2024, SLB  and ChampionX jointly announced a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) for SLB to purchase ChampionX in an all-stock transaction.   The transaction was unanimously approved by the ChampionX board of directors and the transaction received the approval of the ChampionX stockholders at a special meeting held on June 18, 2024.   The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.</p><p class=\"\">ChampionX may continue to pay its regular quarterly cash dividends with customary record and payment dates, subject to certain limitations under the Merger Agreement.   Given the pending acquisition of ChampionX by SLB, ChampionX has discontinued providing quarterly guidance and will not host a conference call or webcast to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2024 results.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Production Chemical Technologies</strong></p><p class=\"\">Production Chemical Technologies revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024 was $569.7 million, an increase of $10.1 million, or 2%, sequentially, due to seasonally higher volumes in certain international markets and higher volumes in North America.</p><p class=\"\">Segment operating profit was $103.6 million and adjusted segment EBITDA was $133.5 million.

Management believes that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income attributable to ChampionX and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ChampionX, provide useful information to investors regarding the Company’s financial condition and results of operations because they reflect the core operating results of our businesses and help facilitate comparisons of operating performance across periods. In addition, free cash flow, free cash flow to adjusted EBITDA ratio, and free cash flow to revenue ratio are used by management to measure our ability to generate positive cash flow for debt reduction and to support our strategic objectives. Although management believes the aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures are good tools for internal use and the investment community in evaluating ChampionX’s overall financial performance, the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
