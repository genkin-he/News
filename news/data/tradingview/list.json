Weak refining and chemicals margins are a theme across the sector and continue to remain under pressure, they said. In January's update, TotalEnergies said its European refining margin marker was $25.9 a metric ton, an increase from $15.4 a ton in the prior quarter. However this is significantly below the $52.6 a ton it reported in the fourth quarter of 2023.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">2025 OBJECTIVES: Alongside its fourth-quarter results, TotalEnergies will present its 2025 objectives but this is not expected to contain major updates to strategy or guidance, the RBC analysts wrote. However, they expect the company to highlight the prospect of signing premium 'clean-firm power' deals in the U.S. given its growing position in the Texas power market and the excitement around U.S. data centers and power demand.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">U.S. DUAL-LISTING: TotalEnergies could formalise its U.S. dual-listing intentions in its 2025 objectives document after its Autumn investor day indicated broad support for the move, JPMorgan analysts wrote in a research note.</li></ul><p class=\"\">Write to Adam Whittaker at adam.whittaker@wsj.com</p></span></div>",
