The number of U.S. homes sold in the third quarter fiscal 2025 increased 14.1% to 6,437 driven by an increase in demand across all sales channels. The ASP per U.S. home sold increased 2.8% to $94,900 due to an increase in the number of units sold through company-owned retail sales centers during the quarter. The number of Canadian factory-built homes sold in the quarter decreased to 209 homes compared to 249 homes in the prior-year period due to softening demand in certain markets.</p><p class=\"\">Gross profit increased by 28.1% to $181.0 million in the third quarter fiscal 2025 compared to the prior-year period. Gross profit margin was 28.1% of net sales, a 280-basis point expansion compared to 25.3% in the third quarter fiscal 2024. Gross margin expansion reflects higher ASPs on new homes sold through company-owned retail sales centers which also generated a greater percentage of total revenue in addition to lower input costs and acquisition synergy capture when compared to the prior-year period.</p><p class=\"\">Selling, general, and administrative expenses (\"SG&amp;A\") in the third quarter fiscal 2025 increased to $108.2 million from $85.1 million in the same period last year. SG&amp;A during the quarter increased due to higher variable compensation from higher sales volumes and profitability as well as investments in people and information systems to support future growth. SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales was 16.8%, compared to 15.2% in the prior year period.</p><p class=\"\">Net income increased by 31.0% to $61.5 million for the third quarter fiscal 2025 compared to the prior-year period. The increase in net income was driven by higher sales and gross profit partially offset by higher SG&amp;A in the quarter.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter fiscal 2025 increased by 25.7% to $83.3 million compared to the third quarter fiscal 2024. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 12.9%, compared to 11.8% in the prior-year period.</p><p class=\"\">As of December 28, 2024, Champion Homes had $581.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $11.5 million in the current quarter. The Company repurchased and retired $20 million of its common stock during the third quarter under the previously announced repurchase program. On January 30, 2025, the Board of Directors refreshed the share repurchase authorization to provide for $100 million of potential future repurchases.</p><p class=\"\">Conference Call and Webcast Information:</p><p class=\"\">Champion Homes' management will host a conference call tomorrow, February 5, 2025, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time, to discuss Champion Homes' financial results and an update on current operations.</p><p class=\"\">Investors and other interested parties can listen to a webcast of the live conference call by logging onto the Investor Relations section of Champion Homes' website at ir.championhomes.com.

With more than 70 years of homebuilding experience and 48 manufacturing facilities throughout the United States and western Canada, Champion Homes is well positioned with an innovative portfolio of manufactured and modular homes, ADUs, park-models and modular buildings for the single-family, multi-family, and hospitality sectors.</p><p class=\"\">In addition to its core home building business, Champion Homes provides construction services to install and set-up factory-built homes, operates a factory-direct retail business with 72 retail locations across the United States, and operates Star Fleet Trucking, providing transportation services to the manufactured housing and other industries from several dispatch locations across the United States.</p><p class=\"\">Champion Homes builds homes under some of the most well-known brand names in the factory-built housing industry including Skyline Homes, Champion Homes, Genesis Homes, Regional Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Atlantic Homes, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, ScotBilt Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, Titan Homes in the U.S. and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada.</p><p class=\"\">Presentation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures</p><p class=\"\">In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\") throughout this press release, Champion Homes has provided Non-GAAP financial measures, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS, (collectively the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\") which present operating results on a basis adjusted for certain items. Champion Homes uses these Non-GAAP Financial Measures for business planning purposes and in measuring its performance relative to that of its competitors. Champion Homes believes that these Non-GAAP Financial Measures are useful financial metrics to assess its operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that Champion Homes believes are not representative of its core business. These Non-GAAP Financial Measures are not intended to replace, and should not be considered superior to, the presentation of Champion Homes' financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP.</p><p class=\"\">Champion Homes defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss attributable to Champion Homes, Inc. plus expenses or minus income, (a) the provision for income taxes, (b) interest income or expense, net, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations, (e) non-cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets, (f) equity in net earnings or losses of ECN, (g) charges related to the remediation of the water intrusion product liability claims; and (h) other non-operating income and costs, including but not limited to those costs for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses, including the change in fair value of contingent consideration, and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales reported in the income statements.</p><p class=\"\">Champion Homes defines Adjusted Net Income as net income or loss attributable to Champion Homes, Inc. plus expenses or minus income (net of tax where applicable), (a) gain or loss from discontinued operations, (b) non-cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets, (c) equity in net earnings or losses of ECN, (d) charges related to the remediation of estimated water intrusion product liability, and (e) other non-operating income or expense including, but not limited to those costs for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses, including the change in fair value of contingent consideration, and idle facilities. Champion Homes defines Adjusted EPS as Adjusted Net Income divided by shares outstanding.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are not measures of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss, net sales, operating income or earnings per share prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. These Non-GAAP Financial Measures do not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities as defined by U.S. GAAP. Champion Homes believes that similar Non-GAAP Financial Measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate its performance and that of its competitors. However, Champion Homes use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures may vary from that of others in its industry. The Non-GAAP Financial Measures are reconciled from the respective measure under U.S. GAAP in the tables below.</p><p class=\"\">Forward-Looking Statements</p><p class=\"\">Statements in this press release, including certain statements regarding Champion Homes' strategic initiatives, and future market demand are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for \"forward-looking statements\" provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Our disciplined execution on higher volumes led to a record first quarter adjusted EBITDA and more than a 300 basis point year-over-year improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margin,” said Martie Edmunds Zakas, Chief Executive Officer of Mueller Water Products.</p><p class=\"\">“We are increasing our fiscal 2025 guidance to primarily reflect our first quarter results and the expected benefits from recent price actions. We expect to deliver gross and adjusted EBITDA margin gains this year supported by our operational and commercial initiatives, including the anticipated benefits from the recent closure of our legacy brass foundry.”</p><p class=\"\">“With our continued focus on serving our customers and delivering on our key strategic priorities, we are well-positioned to capture the benefits from the investments needed to address the aging North American water infrastructure. We are confident we can execute our key strategies while managing external challenges as we further strengthen Mueller for the long term to benefit all our stakeholders,” Ms. Zakas concluded.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Consolidated Results</strong></p><p class=\"\">Net sales for the 2025 first quarter increased $47.9 million, or 18.7 percent, to $304.3 million as compared with $256.4 million in the prior year quarter primarily due to increased volumes at Water Flow Solutions and Water Management Solutions and higher pricing across most product lines.</p><p class=\"\">Operating income for the first quarter increased $24.6 million, or 107.9 percent, to $47.4 million as compared with $22.8 million in the prior year quarter. Benefits from increased volumes, lower strategic reorganization and other charges, lower amortization and favorable price/cost were partially offset by higher SG&amp;A expenses and the impacts of the Israel-Hamas war at Water Management Solutions. Operating margin for the first quarter was 15.6 percent as compared with 8.9 percent in the prior year quarter.</p><p class=\"\">During the quarter, the Company incurred $1.7 million of strategic reorganization and other charges, primarily related to the leadership transition and severance. Additionally, the Company incurred $3.3 million in inventory and other asset write-downs associated with the closure of our legacy brass foundry in Decatur, Illinois, as we transition operations to our new foundry. Both of these amounts have been excluded from adjusted results.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted operating income increased $23.0 million, or 78.2 percent, to $52.4 million as compared with $29.4 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted operating margin improved to 17.2 percent as compared with 11.5 percent in the prior year quarter.</p><p class=\"\">Net income increased $21.0 million, or 146.9 percent, to $35.3 million as compared with $14.3 million in the prior year quarter. Net income margin improved to 11.6 percent as compared with 5.6 percent in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income increased $19.3 million, or 97.0 percent, to $39.2 million as compared with $19.9 million in the prior year quarter.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA of $63.5 million increased $18.7 million, or 41.7 percent, as compared with $44.8 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 20.9 percent as compared with 17.5 percent in the prior year quarter.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Segment Results</strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><em>Water Flow Solutions</em></strong></p><p class=\"\">Net sales for the 2025 first quarter increased $33.3 million, or 23.6 percent, to $174.6 million as compared with $141.3 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher volumes of iron gate and specialty valves as well as higher pricing across most product lines.</p><p class=\"\">Operating income and adjusted operating income were $35.3 million and $38.6 million, respectively, for the first quarter. Adjusted operating income increased $11.2 million, or 40.9 percent, compared with the prior year quarter. Benefits from increased volumes, lower amortization and favorable price/cost more than offset higher SG&amp;A expenses and unfavorable manufacturing performance. Operating margin and adjusted operating margin were 20.2 percent and 22.1 percent, respectively, as compared with the prior year quarter operating margin of 19.2 percent and adjusted operating margin of 19.4 percent.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA of $44.7 million increased $8.0 million, or 21.8 percent, as compared with $36.7 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.6 percent as compared with 26.0 percent in the prior year quarter.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><em>Water Management Solutions</em></strong></p><p class=\"\">Net sales for the 2025 first quarter increased $14.6 million, or 12.7 percent, to $129.7 million as compared with $115.1 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher volumes of hydrants as well as higher pricing across most product lines.</p><p class=\"\">Operating income and adjusted operating income were $27.3 million and $27.6 million, respectively, for the first quarter. Adjusted operating income increased $12.5 million, or 82.8 percent, compared with the prior year quarter. Benefits from higher volumes, favorable manufacturing performance, lower SG&amp;A expenses, including benefits from amortization and foreign exchange, and favorable price/cost more than offset the impacts of the Israel-Hamas war. Operating margin and adjusted operating margin were 21.0 percent and 21.3 percent, respectively, as compared with the prior year quarter operating and adjusted operating margins of 13.1 percent.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA of $32.6 million increased $10.5 million, or 47.5 percent, as compared with $22.1 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.1 percent as compared with 19.2 percent in the prior year quarter.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Interest Expense, Net</strong></p><p class=\"\">Interest expense, net, for the 2025 first quarter decreased to $1.6 million as compared with $3.3 million in the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of higher interest income.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Income Taxes</strong></p><p class=\"\">For the 2025 first quarter, income tax expense was $10.5 million, or 22.9 percent of income before tax, as compared with $2.6 million in the prior year quarter, or 15.4 percent of income before tax. The higher effective tax rate for the 2025 first quarter was primarily a result of the income tax rate in the prior year quarter, which included a $1.6 million income tax benefit associated with the expiration of an uncertain tax position that expired on December 31, 2023, and was offset by the release of a $1.6 million indemnification receivable in Other expense. Excluding the benefit in the prior year quarter, the effective tax rate for the 2025 first quarter was comparable to the prior year quarter.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Cash Flow and Balance Sheet</strong></p><p class=\"\">Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, decreased by $13.8 million to $54.1 million as compared with $67.9 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by changes in working capital, including other current liabilities such as incentive compensation, partially offset by higher net income compared with the prior year quarter.</p><p class=\"\">During the quarter, the Company invested $11.9 million in capital expenditures as compared with $5.7 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by increased expenditures in our foundries and timing of spending in the prior year.</p><p class=\"\">Free cash flow (defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures) for the quarter decreased by $20.0 million to $42.2 million as compared with $62.2 million in the prior year quarter, due to the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and higher capital expenditures.</p><p class=\"\">As of December 31, 2024, Mueller Water Products had $449.5 million of total debt outstanding and $338.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, resulting in a debt leverage ratio of 1.5 times and a net debt leverage ratio of 0.4 times. We did not have any borrowings under our ABL Agreement at the end of the quarter, nor did we borrow any amounts under our ABL during the quarter. There are no maturities on the Company’s debt financings until June 2029, and our 4.0 percent Senior Notes have no financial maintenance covenants.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Fiscal 2025 Outlook</strong></p><p class=\"\">The Company is increasing its guidance for fiscal 2025 consolidated net sales to be between $1,370 million and $1,390 million, or an increase of 4.2 percent to 5.7 percent compared with the prior year. The Company is also increasing its expectations for fiscal 2025 adjusted EBITDA to be between $310 million and $315 million, or an increase of 8.9 percent to 10.6 percent compared with the prior year. The Company anticipates free cash flow as a percentage of adjusted net income to be more than 80 percent in fiscal 2025. This guidance does not include any potential impacts from the recently announced tariffs.</p><p class=\"\">The Company’s expectations for certain additional financial metrics for fiscal 2025 are as follows:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Total SG&amp;A expenses between $240 million and $244 million</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Net interest expense between $10.5 million and $11.5 million</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Effective income tax rate between 25 percent and 27 percent</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Depreciation and amortization between $43 million and $45 million (1)</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Capital expenditures between $45 million and $50 million</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Pension benefit other than service of approximately $0.2 million</li></ul><p class=\"\">(1) In 2025, annual amortization expense will decrease by approximately $18 million due to customer relationship intangibles from 2005 becoming fully amortized.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Conference Call Webcast</strong></p><p class=\"\">Mueller Water Products’ quarterly earnings conference call will take place Wednesday, February 5, 2025, at 9:30 a.m. ET. Members of Mueller Water Products’ leadership team will discuss the Company’s recent financial performance and respond to questions from financial analysts. A live webcast of the call will be available on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website. Please go to the website (www.muellerwaterproducts.com) at least 15 minutes prior to the start of the call to register, download and install any necessary software. A replay of the call will be available for 30 days and can be accessed by dialing 1-866-511-1891. An archive of the webcast will also be available for at least 90 days on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Use of Non-GAAP Measures</strong></p><p class=\"\">In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company’s results as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), the Company also provides non-GAAP information that management believes is useful to investors. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and securities analysts, investors and other interested parties should not consider any of these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP measures that the Company presents as performance measures because management uses these measures to evaluate the Company’s underlying performance on a consistent basis across periods and to make decisions about operational strategies. Management also believes these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of the Company’s recurring performance.</p><p class=\"\">Net debt and net debt leverage are non-GAAP measures that the Company presents as liquidity measures because management uses them to evaluate its capital management and financial position, and the investment community commonly uses them as measures of indebtedness. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP liquidity measure used to assist management and investors in analyzing the Company’s ability to generate liquidity from its operating activities.</p><p class=\"\">The calculations of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to GAAP results are included as an attachment to this press release, which has been posted online at www.muellerwaterproducts.com. The Company does not reconcile forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures, as permitted by Regulation S-K, as certain items, e.g., expenses related to corporate development activities, transactions, pension expenses/(benefits), corporate restructuring and non-cash asset impairment, may have not yet occurred, are out of the Company’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted without unreasonable efforts. Additionally, such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty regarding relevant items that may be confusing to investors. Such items could have a substantial impact on GAAP measures of the Company's financial performance.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Forward-Looking Statements</strong></p><p class=\"\">This press release contains certain statements that may be deemed “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and assessments made by the Company in light of the Company’s experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments.</p><p class=\"\">Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, without limitation, logistical challenges and supply chain disruptions, geopolitical conditions, including the Israel-Hamas war, public health crises, or other events; inventory and in-stock positions of our distributors and end customers; an inability to realize the anticipated benefits from our operational initiatives, including our large capital investments in Decatur, Illinois, plant closures, and reorganization and related strategic realignment activities; an inability to attract or retain a skilled and diverse workforce, including executive officers, increased competition related to the workforce and labor markets; an inability to protect the Company’s information systems against further service interruption, risks resulting from possible future cybersecurity incidents, misappropriation of data or breaches of security; failure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws; cyclical and changing demand in core markets such as municipal spending, residential construction, and natural gas distribution; government monetary or fiscal policies; the impact of adverse weather conditions; the impact of manufacturing and product performance; the impact of wage, commodity and materials price inflation; foreign exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of higher interest rates; the impact of warranty charges and claims, and related accommodations; the strength of our brands and reputation; an inability to successfully resolve significant legal proceedings or government investigations; compliance with environmental, trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations; climate change and legal or regulatory responses thereto; changing regulatory, trade and tariff conditions; the failure to integrate and/or realize any of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or divestitures; an inability to achieve some or all of our goals and commitments in environmental and sustainability programs; and other factors that are described in the section entitled “RISK FACTORS” in Item 1A of the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and later filings on Form 10-Q, as applicable.</p><p class=\"\">Forward-looking statements do not guarantee future performance and are only as of the date they are made.

For example, future hiring and employee turnover may not be reasonably predictable, stock-based compensation expense depends on variables that are largely not within the control of nor predictable by management, such as the market price of 8x8 common stock, and may also be significantly impacted by events like acquisitions, the timing and nature of which are difficult to predict with accuracy. The actual amounts of these excluded items could have a significant impact on the Company's GAAP operating margin and GAAP net income per share, basic and diluted. Accordingly, management believes that reconciliations of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their corresponding GAAP measures are not available without unreasonable effort. See the \"Explanation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\" below for the definition of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP net income per share, basic and diluted.</p><p class=\"\">All projections are on a non-GAAP basis.

Any statements that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. For example, words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" \"strategy,\" \"believes,\" \"anticipates,\" \"plans,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: changing industry trends; the size of our market opportunity; the potential success and impact of our investments in artificial intelligence technologies; our strategic transformation initiatives; our ability to drive increased platform and multi product adoption; our ability to increase profitability and cash flow; deleverage our balance sheet and fund investment in innovation; whether our unified communication and contact center traffic will increase; whether we can increase customer retention; our future revenue and growth (including platform usage revenue); whether we can sustain an increasing pace of innovation; the success of our go-to-market engine; our ability to improve general and administrative synergies; our ability to enhance shareholder value; and our financial outlook, revenue growth, and profitability, including whether we will achieve sustainable growth and profitability.</p><p class=\"\">You should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements depending on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: a reduction in our total costs as a percentage of revenue may negatively impact our revenues and our business; customer adoption and demand for our products may be lower than we anticipate; the impact of economic downturns on us and our customers; ongoing volatility and conflict in the political environment; inflationary pressures and rising interest rates; competitive dynamics of the cloud communication and collaboration markets, including voice, contact center, video, messaging, and communication application programming interfaces, as well as our competitors' use of AI, in which we compete, may change in ways we are not anticipating; third parties may assert ownership rights in our IP, which may limit or prevent our continued use of the core technologies behind our solutions; our customer churn rate may be higher than we anticipate; our investments in marketing, channel and value-added resellers, new products, and our acquisition of Fuze, Inc. may not result in meeting our revenue or operating margin targets we forecast in our guidance, for a particular quarter or for the full fiscal year. Our increased emphasis on profitability and cash flow generation may not be successful. The reduction in our total costs as a percentage of revenue may negatively impact our revenue and our business in ways we do not anticipate and may not achieve the desired outcome.</p><p class=\"\">For a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, see \"Risk Factors\" in the Company's reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, as well as other reports that 8x8, Inc. files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement, and 8x8, Inc. undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement for any reason, except as required by law, even as new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.</p><p class=\"\">Explanation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation The Company has provided in this release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage, and evaluate the business, and to make operating decisions. Management believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating the Company's ongoing operational performance. Management also believes that some of 8x8's investors use these Non-GAAP financial measures as an additional tool in evaluating 8x8's \"core operating performance\" in the ordinary, ongoing, and customary course of the Company's operations. Core operating performance excludes items that are non-cash, not expected to recur, or not reflective of ongoing financial results. Management also believes that looking at the Company's core operating performance provides consistency in period-to-period comparisons and trends.</p><p class=\"\">These Non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies, which limits the usefulness of these measures for comparative purposes. Management recognizes that these Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, including the fact that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of items to exclude from the Non-GAAP financial information. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the table titled \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\". Detailed explanations of the adjustments from comparable GAAP to Non-GAAP financial measures are as follows:</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Costs of Revenue, Costs of Service Revenue and Costs of Other Revenue</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Costs of Revenue includes: (i) Non-GAAP Cost of Service Revenue, which is Cost of Service Revenue excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, and certain severance, transition and contract exit costs; and (ii) Non-GAAP Cost of Other Revenue, which is Cost of Other Revenue excluding stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, and certain severance, transition and contract exit costs.</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Service Revenue Gross Margin, Other Revenue Gross Margin, and Total Revenue Gross Margin</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Service Revenue Gross Profit and Margin as a percentage of Service Revenue and Non-GAAP Other Revenue Gross Profit and Margin as a percentage of Other Revenue are computed as Service Revenue less Non-GAAP Cost of Service Revenue divided by Service Revenue and Other Revenue less Non-GAAP Cost of Other Revenue divided by Other Revenue, respectively. Non-GAAP Total Revenue Gross Profit and Margin as a percentage of Total Revenue is computed as Total Revenue less Non-GAAP Cost of Service Revenue and Non-GAAP Cost of Other Revenue divided by Total Revenue. Management believes the Company's investors benefit from understanding these adjustments and from an alternative view of the Company's Cost of Service Revenue and Cost of Other Revenue, as well as the Company's Service, Other and Total Revenue Gross Margin performance compared to prior periods and trends.</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Operating Profit and Non-GAAP Operating Margin</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Operating Profit excludes: amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, acquisition and integration expenses, certain legal and regulatory costs, certain severance, transition and contract exit costs, and impairment of long-lived assets from Operating Profit (Loss). Non-GAAP Operating Margin is Non-GAAP Operating Profit divided by Revenue. Management believes that these exclusions provide investors with a supplemental view of the Company's ongoing operating performance.</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Net Income excludes: amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, acquisition and integration expenses, certain legal and regulatory costs, certain severance, transition and contract exit costs, impairment of long-lived assets, amortization of debt discount and issuance cost, loss on debt extinguishment, gain on remeasurement of warrants, and other income. Adjusted EBITDA excludes interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation, amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs, and other income (expense), net from non-GAAP net income. Management believes the Company's investors benefit from understanding these adjustments and an alternative view of our net income performance as compared to prior periods and trends.</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share — Basic and Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share - Diluted</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share — Basic is Non-GAAP Net Income divided by the weighted-average basic shares outstanding. Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share — Diluted is Non-GAAP Net Income divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. Diluted shares outstanding include the effect of potentially dilutive securities from stock-based benefit plans and convertible senior notes. These potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of net loss per share attributable to common stockholders on a GAAP basis because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. They are added for the computation of diluted net income per share on a non-GAAP basis in periods when 8x8 has net profit on a non-GAAP basis as their inclusion provides a better indication of 8x8's underlying business performance. Management believes the Company's investors benefit by understanding our Non-GAAP net income performance as reflected in a per share calculation as ways of measuring performance by ownership in the Company. Management believes these adjustments offer investors a useful view of the Company's diluted net income per share as compared to prior periods and trends.</p><p class=\"\">Management evaluates and makes decisions about its business operations based on Non-GAAP financial information by excluding items management does not consider to be \"core costs\" or \"core proceeds.\" Management believes some of its investors also evaluate our \"core operating performance\" as a means of evaluating our performance in the ordinary, ongoing, and customary course of our operations. Management excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets, which primarily represents a non-cash expense of technology and/or customer relationships already developed, to provide a supplemental way for investors to compare the Company's operations pre-acquisition to those post-acquisition and to those of our competitors that have pursued internal growth strategies. Stock-based compensation expense has been excluded because it is a non-cash expense and relies on valuations based on future conditions and events, such as the market price of 8x8 common stock, that are difficult to predict and/or largely not within the control of management. The related employer payroll taxes for stock-based compensation are excluded since they are incurred only due to the associated stock-based compensation expense. Acquisition and integration expenses consist of external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition and strategic investment activities such as legal and other professional services, due diligence, integration, and other closing costs, which are costs that vary significantly in amount and timing. Legal and regulatory costs include litigation and other professional services, as well as certain tax and regulatory liabilities. Severance, transition and contract exit costs include employee termination benefits, executive severance agreements, and cancellation of certain contracts and lease impairments. Debt amortization expenses relate to the non-cash accretion of the debt discount.</p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"> <br/>                               8x8, INC.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Key Tronic Corporation, a provider of electronic manufacturing services (EMS), has released its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, ending December 28, 2024. The results align with the updated guidance provided on January 24, 2025.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Financial Highlights</strong></p> <p class=\"\">For the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, Key Tronic reported total revenue of $113.9 million, a decrease from $147.8 million in the same period of fiscal year 2024. The company attributed the lower revenue to unexpected component shortages, reduced holiday season production, and decreased demand from certain customers, which collectively reduced revenue by approximately $15 million from initial guidance.</p><p class=\"\">Gross margins for the quarter were 6.8%, down from 8.0% in the same period last year, while operating margins were (1.0)% compared to 2.7% in the previous year. The net loss for the quarter was $(4.9) million or $(0.46) per share, compared to net income of $1.1 million or $0.10 per share in the same period of fiscal year 2024.</p><p class=\"\">For the first six months of fiscal year 2025, total revenue was $245.4 million, down from $298.0 million in the same period of fiscal year 2024. The net loss for the first six months was $(3.8) million or $(0.35) per share, compared to net income of $1.4 million or $0.13 per share in the same period of fiscal year 2024.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Business and Operational Highlights</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Key Tronic is planning to significantly increase production capacity in Arkansas and Vietnam to meet growing customer demand for rebalancing their contract manufacturing. The company believes these initiatives will help mitigate the impact of recently announced tariffs on goods manufactured in China and Mexico.</p><p class=\"\">Despite the revenue decline, Key Tronic continued to win new programs, including aerospace systems and an energy resiliency technology program, which could generate annual revenue in excess of $60 million once fully ramped. The company also closed on a long-term debt refinancing agreement during the quarter, expanding available capital for growth.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Key Tronic is actively streamlining its international and domestic operations, with further headcount reductions to enhance efficiency. The company is also aligning its inventory levels with current revenue levels to improve overall profitability in the longer term.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Management's Perspective</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Brett Larsen, President and CEO, expressed disappointment with the unexpected revenue decline but remains optimistic about future improvements. He highlighted the company's strategic initiatives and new program wins as positive indicators for future growth and profitability.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Future Outlook</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Due to uncertainty in the economic and political environments related to potential tariffs, Key Tronic will not be issuing revenue or earnings guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025. The company will host a conference call to discuss its financial results and provide further insights.</p><p class=\"\">SEC Filing: <a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/719733/000071973325000007/ktcc-20250204.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">KEY TRONIC CORP [ KTCC ] - 8-K - Feb. 04, 2025</a></p></span></div>",

The Company has not included a quantitative reconciliation of its guidance for non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted net income per share to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, other than stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, because certain of these reconciling items, including change in fair value of contingent consideration, transaction costs, restructuring and other costs and income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments, could be highly variable and cannot be reasonably predicted without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing of certain events that have not yet occurred and are out of the Company’s control and the amounts of associated reconciling items.

Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements are included under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and any subsequent public filings. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, and new risks may emerge from time to time. It is not possible for us to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made and are based on information available to us at the time those statements are made and/or management’s good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, except as required by law.</p><p class=\"\">Presentation Changes Related to SaaS and License Revenue</p><p class=\"\">Effective July 1, 2024, the Company adjusted the classification of support services related to subscription license to be included within “license” on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Prior to July 1, 2024, support services related to subscription license were included in a line item entitled “SaaS and Support.” Accordingly, effective July 1, 2024, SaaS revenues include subscription fees from clients accessing our SaaS solutions, premium support services related to SaaS, and updates, if any, to the subscribed service during the subscription term. There was no change to the Company's revenue recognition policy, except for the change in classification noted herein.</p><p class=\"\">The presentation of cost of revenues has been conformed to reflect the changes related to the presentation of revenues. Such reclassifications related to the presentation of revenues and cost of revenues did not affect total revenues, operating income, or net income.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Metrics</strong></p><p class=\"\">This press release contains the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted net income per share. These non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, change in fair value of contingent consideration, transaction costs, restructuring and other costs and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. See below for a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.</p><p class=\"\">Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure, and a supplemental liquidity measure that management uses to evaluate our core operating business and our ability to meet our current and future financing and investing needs. It consists of net cash provided by operating activities less cash paid for purchases of property and equipment. See below for a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.</p><p class=\"\">Other metrics include total ARR, Cloud ARR and Cloud net revenue retention rate. Total ARR represents the annualized recurring value of all active SaaS and on-premise subscription license contracts at the end of a reporting period. Cloud ARR is the portion of the annualized recurring value of our active SaaS contracts at the end of a reporting period. Contracts with a term other than one year are annualized by taking the committed contract value for the current period divided by number of days in that period, then multiplying by 365. Cloud net revenue retention rate is the portion of our net revenue retention rate, which represents the net revenue retention of our SaaS contracts. We calculate Cloud net revenue retention by starting with the Cloud ARR from the cohort of all clients as of the twelve months prior to the applicable fiscal period, or prior period Cloud ARR. We then calculate the Cloud ARR from these same clients as of the current fiscal period, or current period Cloud ARR. We then divide the current period Cloud ARR by the prior period Cloud ARR to calculate the Cloud net revenue retention.</p><p class=\"\">We believe these non-GAAP financial measures and metrics provide useful information to investors as they are used by management to manage the business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance, and allocate resources and provide useful information regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different than similarly-titled measures used by other companies, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.</p><p class=\"\">Guidance for non-GAAP financial measures excludes stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, change in fair value of contingent consideration, transaction costs, restructuring and other costs and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income by the estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the period.</p><p class=\"\"><strong

The passcode is 13750890. A replay of this conference call will be available through February 11, 2025 at 844-512-2921 (domestic) or 412-317-6671 (international). The replay passcode is 13750890. A live webcast of this conference call will be available on the \"Investors\" page of the Company's website (www.varonis.com), and a replay will be archived on the website as well.</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators</p><p class=\"\">Varonis believes that the use of non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) is helpful to our investors. These measures, which the Company refers to as our non-GAAP financial measures, are not prepared in accordance with GAAP.</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP operating income (loss) is calculated as operating income (loss) excluding (i) stock-based compensation expense, (ii) payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation, and (iii) amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related expenses.</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP net income (loss) is calculated as net income (loss) excluding (i) stock-based compensation expense, (ii) payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation, (iii) amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related expenses, (iv) foreign exchange gains (losses) which include exchange rate differences on lease contracts as a result of the implementation of ASC 842 and (v) amortization of debt issuance costs.</p><p class=\"\">The Company believes that the exclusion of these expenses provides a more meaningful comparison of our operational performance from period to period and offers investors and management greater visibility to the underlying performance of our business. Specifically:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Stock-based compensation expenses utilize varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and a variety of equity instruments that can impact a company's non-cash expenses;</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Payroll taxes are tied to the exercise or vesting of underlying equity awards and the price of our common stock at the time of vesting or exercise, factors which may vary from period to period;</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Acquired intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition and are amortized over an estimated useful life after the acquisition, and acquisition-related expenses are unrelated to current operations and neither are comparable to the prior period nor predictive of future results;</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">The Company incurs foreign exchange gains or losses from the revaluation of its significant operating lease liabilities in foreign currencies as well as other assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars, which may vary from period to period; and</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Amortization of debt issuance costs, which relate to the Company’s convertible senior notes issued in 2020 and 2024, are a non-cash item.</li></ul><p class=\"\">Free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by or used in operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We believe that free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash provided by or used in our operations that, after the investments in property and equipment, can be used for strategic initiatives.</p><p class=\"\">Each of our non-GAAP financial measures is an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our own operating results over different periods of time. The non-GAAP financial measures do not represent our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to operating income (loss) or net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. Further, stock-based compensation expense and payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation have been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, significant recurring expenses in our business and an important part of the compensation provided to our employees. Also, the amortization of intangible assets are expected recurring expenses over the estimated useful life of the underlying intangible asset and acquisition-related expenses will be incurred to the extent acquisitions are made in the future. Additionally, foreign exchange rates may fluctuate from one period to another, and the Company does not estimate movements in foreign currencies. Finally, the amortization of debt issuance costs are expected recurring expenses until the maturity of the senior notes in 2029.</p><p class=\"\">The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Varonis urges investors to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measures to evaluate our business.</p><p class=\"\">A reconciliation for non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) referred to in our “Financial Outlook” is not provided because, as forward-looking statements, such reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort due to the high variability, complexity, and difficulty of estimating certain items such as charges to stock-based compensation expense and currency fluctuations which could have an impact on our consolidated results. The Company believes the information provided is useful to investors because it can be considered in the context of the Company’s historical disclosures of this measure.</p><p class=\"\">ARR is a key performance indicator defined as the annualized value of active SaaS contracts, term-based subscription license contracts, and maintenance contracts in effect at the end of that period. SaaS contracts, term-based subscription license contracts, and maintenance contracts are annualized by dividing the total contract value by the number of days in the term and multiplying the result by 365. The annualized value of contracts is a legal and contractual determination made by assessing the contractual terms with our customers. The annualized value of maintenance contracts is not determined by reference to historical revenues, deferred revenues or any other GAAP financial measure over any period. ARR is not a forecast of future revenues, which can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Forward-Looking Statements</strong></p><p class=\"\">This press release contains, and statements made during the above referenced conference call will contain, \"forward-looking\" statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including regarding the Company's growth rate and its expectations regarding future revenues, operating income or loss or earnings or loss per share.

These and other important risk factors are described more fully in Varonis’ reports and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and could cause actual results to vary from expectations. All information provided in this press release and in the conference call is as of the date hereof, and Varonis undertakes no duty to update or revise this information, whether as a result of new information, new developments or otherwise, except as required by law.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Varonis</strong></p><p class=\"\">Varonis  is a leader in data security, fighting a different battle than conventional cybersecurity companies.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">SPOKANE VALLEY, Wash., Feb.  04, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Key Tronic Corporation</strong> , a provider of electronic manufacturing services (EMS), today announced its results for the quarter ended December 28, 2024. These results are in line with the updated guidance provided on January 24, 2025.</p><p class=\"\">For the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, Key Tronic reported total revenue of $113.9 million, compared to $147.8 million in the same period of fiscal year 2024. The lower than anticipated revenue and earnings for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 are primarily due to unexpected shortages for specific components managed by a large customer, lower-than-expected production during the holiday season, and reduced demand from certain customers which together lowered revenue by approximately $15 million from initial guidance for the quarter. For the first six months of fiscal year 2025, total revenue was $245.4 million, compared to $298.0 million in the same period of fiscal year 2024.</p><p class=\"\">Gross margins were 6.8% and operating margins were (1.0)% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, compared to 8.0% and 2.7%, respectively, in the same period of fiscal year 2024. The decline in margins for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 primarily reflects the reduction of revenue. As previously announced, interest expense also included approximately $1.0 million in write-offs of unamortized loan fees related to refinancing the Company’s debt with a new lender.</p><p class=\"\">The net loss was $(4.9) million or $(0.46) per share for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, compared to net income of $1.1 million or $0.10 per share for the same period of fiscal year 2024. For the first six months of fiscal year 2025, the net loss was $(3.8) million or $(0.35) per share, compared to net income of $1.4 million or $0.13 per share for the same period of fiscal year 2024.</p><p class=\"\">The adjusted net loss was $(4.1) million or $(0.38) per share for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, compared to adjusted net income of $1.1 million or $0.10 per share for the same period of fiscal year 2024. The adjusted net loss was $(2.9) million or $(0.27) per share for first six months of fiscal year 2025, compared to adjusted net income of $1.2 million or $0.11 per share for the same period of fiscal year 2024. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” below for additional information about adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share.</p><p class=\"\">“As we announced today, we’re planning to significantly increase production capacity in Arkansas and Vietnam in order to continue to benefit from the growing customer demand for rebalancing their contract manufacturing. We believe these initiatives should help mitigate the adverse impact and uncertainties surrounding the recently announced tariffs on goods manufactured in China and Mexico,” said Brett Larsen, President and CEO.</p><p class=\"\">“We are disappointed with the unexpected decline in revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, however, we expect our revenue and earnings to improve in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 as strategic initiatives undertaken in previous quarters come to fruition. We’re actively streamlining our international and domestic operations, with further headcount reductions to enhance efficiency, building on similar actions a year ago. We’re also pleased to see our inventory levels being more in line with current revenue levels and expect that these strategic changes will improve our overall profitability in the longer term.”  </p><p class=\"\">“At the same time, we continued to win new programs, such as aerospace systems and an energy resiliency technology program, which was recently announced. Once fully ramped, the latter program could generate annual revenue for us in excess of $60 million. We also closed on a long-term debt refinancing agreement during the quarter that expands available capital for growth. We believe Key Tronic remains well positioned for increased growth and profitability in coming periods.”</p><p class=\"\">The financial data presented for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 should be considered preliminary and could be subject to change, as the Company’s independent auditor has not completed their review procedures.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Business Outlook</strong></p><p class=\"\">Due to uncertainty in the economic and political environments related to the impact of recently announced potential tariffs, Key Tronic will not be issuing revenue or earnings guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Conference Call</strong></p><p class=\"\">Key Tronic will host a conference call to discuss its financial results at 2:00 PM Pacific (5:00 PM Eastern) today. A broadcast of the conference call will be available at www.keytronic.com under “Investor Relations” or by calling 888-394-8218 or +1-313-209-4906 (Access Code: 2254355).

Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to those including such words as aims, anticipates, believes, continues, estimates, expects, hopes, intends, plans, predicts, projects, targets, will, or would, similar verbs, or nouns corresponding to such verbs, which may be forward looking. Forward-looking statements also include other passages that are relevant to expected future events, performances, and actions or that can only be fully evaluated by events that will occur in the future. Forward-looking statements in this release include, without limitation, the Company’s statements regarding its expectations with respect to financial conditions and results, including revenue and earnings, cost savings from headcount reduction and the Mexican Peso exchange rate, demand for certain products and the effectiveness of some of its programs, business from customers and programs, and impacts from operational streamlining and efficiencies, including reductions in inventories. There are many factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted or projected in forward-looking statements, including but not limited to: the future of the global economic environment and its impact on our customers and suppliers; the success and timing of our expansion plans; the availability of components from the supply chain; the availability of a healthy workforce; the accuracy of suppliers’ and customers’ forecasts; development and success of customers’ programs and products; timing and effectiveness of ramping of new programs; success of new-product introductions; the risk of legal proceedings or governmental investigations relating to the previously reported financial statement restatements and related material weaknesses, the May 2024 cybersecurity incident and the subject of the internal investigation by the Company’s Audit Committee and related or other unrelated matters; acquisitions or divestitures of operations or facilities; technology advances; changes in pricing policies by the Company, its competitors, customers or suppliers; impact of new governmental legislation and regulation, including tax reform, tariffs and related activities, such trade negotiations and other risks; and other factors, risks, and uncertainties detailed from time to time in the Company’s SEC filings.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Non-GAAP Financial Measures</strong></p><p class=\"\">To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share, diluted. We provide these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they provide greater transparency related to our core operations and represent supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. We exclude (or include) certain items in our non-GAAP financial measures as we believe the net result is a measure of our core business. We believe this facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating potential differences caused by the existence and timing of certain income and expense items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Non-GAAP performance measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, results prepared in accordance with GAAP. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Our non-GAAP financial measures may be different from those reported by other companies. See the table below entitled “Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures” for reconciliations of adjusted net income to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is GAAP net income, and the computation of adjusted net income per share, diluted.</p><div class=\"tableWrapper-pIO_GYwT\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td>CONTACTS:</td><td>Tony

See “Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures” for a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to net loss, the most closely comparable GAAP measure. The Company is unable to provide guidance for net loss or a reconciliation of the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA guidance because it cannot provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of certain reconciling items without unreasonable effort. The Company’s inability to do so is due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation, including variations in effective tax rate, expenses to be incurred for acquisition activities and other one-time or exceptional items.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Conference Call</strong></p><p class=\"\">The Company will host a conference call this afternoon at 5:00 PM Eastern Time.  A live audio webcast of the call will be available on the Company’s website, https://investor.innovage.com.

Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “plan,” “intend,” “believe,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “can have,” “likely,” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements we make regarding quarterly or annual financial guidance; financial outlook, including future revenues and future earnings; the viability of our growth strategy including our ability or expectations to increase the number of participants we serve, to build and/or open de novo centers, or to identify and execute tuck-in acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic partnerships; our ability to control costs, mitigate the effects of elevated expenses, expand our payor capabilities, implement clinical value and operational value initiatives and strengthen enterprise functions; our expectations with respect to audits, post-sanction work, legal proceedings and government investigations and actions; relationships and discussions with regulatory agencies; our ability to effectively implement operational excellence as a provider across all our centers; reimbursement and regulatory developments; market developments; new services; integration activities; industry and market opportunity; and the effects of any of the foregoing on our future results of operations or financial conditions.</p><p class=\"\">Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on currently available information and our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control and may cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially include, among others, the following: (i) the viability of our growth strategy, including our ability to obtain licenses to open our de novo centers in Downey and Bakersfield, California, and our ability to ramp up our de novo centers in Florida; (ii) our ability to identify and successfully complete acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic partnerships; (iii) our ability to attract new participants and retain existing participants; (iv) the impact on our business from ongoing macroeconomic related challenges, including labor shortages, labor competition and inflation; (v) inspections, reviews, audits, and investigations under the federal and state government programs, including any corrective action and adverse findings thereunder; (vi) legal proceedings, enforcement actions and litigation malpractice and privacy disputes, which are costly to defend; (vii) under our PACE contracts, we assume all of the risk that the cost of providing services will exceed our compensation; (viii) the dependence of our revenues upon a limited number of government payors; (ix) the risk that our submissions to government payors may contain inaccurate or unsupportable information, including regarding risk adjustment scores of participants, subjecting us to repayment obligations or penalties; and (x) the impact on our business of renegotiation, non-renewal or termination of capitation agreements with government payors.</p><p class=\"\">Forward-looking statements are based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. We advise you to not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and to review our risk factors and other disclosures included in the reports we file or furnish with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures</strong></p><p class=\"\">In addition to reporting financial information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company is also reporting Center-level Contribution Margin, Center-level Contribution Margin as a percentage of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental measures of operating performance monitored by management that are not defined under GAAP and that do not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to net income (loss) before income taxes, net income (loss) before income taxes margin, net income (loss) and net income (loss) margin, as applicable, as determined by GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are appropriate measures of operating performance because the metrics eliminate the impact of certain expenses that, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, do not relate to our ongoing business performance, allowing us to more effectively evaluate our core operating performance and trends from period to period. We believe that these non-GAAP measures help investors and analysts in comparing our results across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the analysis of other GAAP financial measures, including net income (loss) before taxes, net income (loss) before taxes margin, net income (loss), and net income (loss) margin.</p><p class=\"\">The Company’s management uses Center-level Contribution Margin as the measure for assessing performance of its operating segments.   For purpose of evaluating Center-level Contribution Margin on a center-by-center basis, we do not allocate our sales and marketing expense or corporate, general and administrative expenses across our centers. We define Center-level Contribution Margin as total revenues less external provider costs and cost of care, excluding depreciation and amortization, which includes all medical and pharmacy costs.  </p><p class=\"\">In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by the types of items excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. Our use of the term Adjusted EBITDA varies from others in our industry. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted for interest expense, net, other investment income, depreciation and amortization, and provision (benefit) for income tax as well as addbacks for non-recurring expenses or exceptional items, including charges relating to management equity compensation, litigation costs and settlement, M&amp;A diligence, transaction and integration, business optimization, electronic medical record (“EMR”) implementation, impairment of right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and construction in progress and loss on minority equity interest investment. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of our total revenue. Effective for the year ended June 30, 2024, and going forward, the Company has revised its calculation of Adjusted EBITDA to no longer exclude de novo center development costs and to reflect the impact of other investment income. The presentation for the three and six months ended December 31, 2023 has been recast to conform to the current presentation. For a full reconciliation of Center-level Contribution Margin and Adjusted EBITDA to the most closely comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the attachment to this earnings release.</p><p
