It was the first digital currency. It’s the original, it’s the strongest one,” said Sacks. “It’s been around for over a dozen years now. No one’s ever hacked it. No one’s ever cracked the security around it.”</p><p class=\"\">During a news conference earlier Tuesday, Sacks outlined the Trump administration’s agenda on cryptocurrencies. The crypto czar revealed that evaluating a potential bitcoin reserve is one of the top priorities for the administration’s internal working group. A national strategic bitcoin reserve is one of many pro-crypto policies that Trump pushed during his election campaign. </p><p class=\"\">Trump has also supported greater clarity in regulating cryptocurrencies, as he signed an executive order to establish a crypto working group to draft new regulations for crypto assets.</p><p class=\"\">“I was on the Hill today meeting with the leaders of our House and Senate committees for banking and for finance, and they are very committed to moving legislation through the House and the Senate this year in order to provide that clear regulatory framework that the digital assets ecosystem needs to sustain innovation in the United States,” Sacks told CNBC, adding that it could be done in the next six months.</p><p class=\"\">Such movements were matched by a major shift happening in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the agency’s approach to cryptocurrencies.</p><p class=\"\">The agency’s newly created crypto task force is now working on distinguishing which cryptocurrencies are securities, which was an issue overshadowed by the SEC’s years-long “regulation by enforcement” approach under former chair Gary Gensler.</p><p class=\"\">Earlier today, the New York Times also reported that the SEC is moving to scale back its special unit for crypto enforcement actions, relocating some of its lawyers to other departments in the agency.</p><p class=\"\">During his interview with CNBC, Sacks also mentioned that the administration wants to bring stablecoin innovation, currently happening mostly offshore, to the U.S. by allowing the issuance of stablecoins domestically.</p><p class=\"\">“I think the power of stablecoins is that it could extend the dollar's dominance internationally, extend it online digitally, and create potentially trillions of dollars of new demand for our U.S. Treasuries,” Sacks said.</p><p class=\"\">Despite bitcoin being the focus of back-to-back announcements from U.S. authorities, the world’s largest cryptocurrency fell 2.8% to $98,052, struggling to recover much from China’s retaliatory announcement in response to Trump’s tariff proclamation.</p><p class=\"\">Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

That is higher than its ROE of 7.2% in FY 2024. Analyst Mohd Shanaz Noor Azam says the Malaysian conglomerate could optimize working capital, streamline its portfolio and improve cost efficiencies to help it reach the target. Its industrial division is well-positioned to benefit from the global energy transition and steady demand for rental and after-sales services, contributing to long-term growth, he adds.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">0314 GMT - The U.S. Treasury 10-year yield still faces downside risk, based on daily charts, says Quek Ser Leang of UOB's Global Economics &amp; Markets Research in a research report. There's a possibility the 10-year yield will fall into the daily Ichimoku cloud, which is currently between 4.318% and 4.447%, the markets strategist says. Going forward, a break of the 10-year yield below the bottom of the daily Ichimoku cloud might potentially trigger sharp declines, the strategist says. On the other hand, if the 10-year yield rises above 4.690%, this would suggest that the 10-year yield is likely to trade in a range, the strategist adds. Treasury 10-year yield is steady at 4.5167%. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0257 GMT - Stronger-than-expected labor cash earnings growth in Japan and an expansionary services PMI reading continues to support BOJ policy normalization, ING's Min Joo Kang says. Data released earlier showed solid on-year labor cash earnings growth in December, with base earnings rising steadily for a second month, while January's services PMI marked its highest level since September 2024. \"Strong wage growth is likely to lead to consumption growth and keep inflation above 2%,\" the economist says. The market is pricing in another BOJ rate hike in July, but ING forecasts a move in May is possible, especially if this year's Shunto wage talk results are as strong as last year's. ING now sees BOJ's terminal rate at 1.25% versus 1.0% previously, tipping hikes in May and October of 2025, followed by another in 2026. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0254 GMT - The future path of the U.S.-China trade conflict remains highly uncertain, say Goldman Sachs analysts in a note. China's retaliatory tariffs appear much less than proportional compared to the U.S.'s 10% across-the-board additional tariff on $525 billion worth of Chinese goods, they write. However, the combination of retaliatory tariffs with export bans, entity list additions, and antitrust probe into Google, suggests a \"more coordinated and comprehensive approach by [Chinese] policymakers\" than during the 2018-2019 U.S.-China trade war, they say. In the coming days, the U.S.'s reactions to China's retaliation will be among key events to watch, they add. (amanda.lee@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0230 GMT - Unemployment in New Zealand is still rising despite rapid interest-rate cuts since mid-2024, leaving consumers and business owners still searching to see the light of an economic recovery. Mark Smith, senior economist at ASB Bank expects demand for labor will continue to weaken until a modest economic recovery finally shows up in the second half of 2025. Firms will have to carefully manage employee headcount in that time, he adds. With inflation close to the target midpoint and monetary settings still slowing the economy, further swift monetary easing looks appropriate to limit economic and labor market scarring, he adds. (james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ)</p><p class=\"\">0225 GMT - Japan's services sector is off to a strong start in 2025, the au Jibun Bank PMI compiled by S&amp;P Global suggests. January data point to a solid upturn in business activity across the sector, accompanied by a steeper, solid rise in new business inflows. The survey signaled a sharp jump in average prices charged by service providers, while exports rose for the first time in four months. Firms are upbeat on their prospects over the coming 12 months and have boosted staffing levels, says Usamah Bhatti, economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Services continue to underpin growth in Japan's private sector, contrasting the weakness in manufacturing. Still, companies are confident that private-sector activity will rise over 2025, expecting a rebound in manufacturing output and a broad-based economic recovery, Bhatti says.

Japanese data released earlier showed the economy's real wages rose 0.6% in December from a year earlier, marking a second straight month of increases. A solid rise in Japanese labor cash earnings will reinforce the current market pricing in at least one more rate hike by the BOJ this year, CBA's Joseph Capurso says in a note. In addition, with the 'tariff war' between the U.S. and other countries seemingly ongoing, the AUD/JPY is likely to retest support at 94.69, the head of International and Sustainable Economics adds. USD/JPY falls 0.6% to 153.36; AUD/JPY drops 0.7% to 95.88. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0213 GMT - There are reasons to be hopeful that a recovery in New Zealand's economy in the second half of this year will help businesses avoid more cuts to headcount, says Mary Jo Vergara, an economist at Kiwibank. But should the required rate relief not come from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the risk of further ​job losses only grows, she says. The RBNZ's current forecasts suggest the OCR will get to 3.5% this year and no lower until deep in 2027. That will leave monetary conditions too restrictive, Vergara says. RBNZ will need to get the OCR down to 3% this year. Holding out longer will only cause unnecessary and indeed avoidable damage to the labor market, she adds. (james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ)</p><p class=\"\">0144 GMT - There are no signs yet that aggressive interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand since mid-2024 are gaining traction and lifting the economy, says Ben Jarman, chief economist at JP Morgan. To be sure, recent GDP revisions show a more worrying economic trajectory, he adds. The data have yet to turn up meaningfully because policy traction is still being blunted by earlier OCR hikes, he adds. This has slowed the lowering of new mortgage rates, and any improvement in disposable incomes, Jarman says. A number of households will still be rolling their mortgages into higher rates than previous, he adds.

Data released earlier show Japan's real wages rose 0.6% in December from a year earlier, marking a second straight month of increases and adding to the case for another BOJ rate hike. The sharp rise in the BOJ's core CPI inflation forecasts in the January outlook report, together with Gov. Ueda's recent comment that there's \"still a significant distance to the neutral rate of interest,\" has sparked worries over an acceleration of rate hikes and an increase in the terminal rate for this cycle, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities' fixed income strategists say in a recent report. The JGB 10-year yield is 1.5 bps higher at 1.290%. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0141 GMT - New Zealand's unemployment in 4Q 2024 rose to a four-year high of 5.1%. While this was in line with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's forecasts, money markets should expect a cut in the official cash rate later this month of \"at least\" 50 basis points, says Kieran Davies, chief macro strategist at Coolabah Capital. The unemployment rate almost matches the peak of 5.2% reached during the short Covid recession in 2020, Davies notes. (james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ)</p><p class=\"\">0132 GMT - From a policy perspective, data showing New Zealand's unemployment rates at a 4-year high of 5.1% reaffirm the view that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will continue to lower rates sequentially over 1H, including another 50-basis-point cut at a policy meeting later this month, says Andrew Boak, chief economist at Goldman Sachs. Boak continues to expect the RBNZ to slow the pace of cuts to 25 basis points per meeting, starting in April, ultimately reaching a terminal official cash rate of 3.0% in July. Still, the risks are skewed to faster and deeper cuts if the recent improvement in high-frequency surveys does not translate into some improvement in the economy, he adds. (james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ)</p><p class=\"\">0058 GMT - Trump's 10% tariff hike on China will likely cause faster industry consolidation among its industrial companies, Citi Research analysts led by Eric Lau say. While major exporters like Techtronic and Shenzhou have diversified production into Asean to avoid tariffs, smaller Chinese companies are unable to do so given difficulty in obtaining bank loans and lack of management resources, they say in a note. The tariff hike could cause them significant distress and spike the unemployment rate in China as these firms constitute about 79% of the total workforce, they add. That could lead China to roll out more stimulus to counter the economic impact. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Australian online bookmaker BlueBet Holdings  has made a $15 million offer to acquire Queensland sports and betting company TopSport. BlueBet will acquire a number of TopSport’s key assets including its customer database, brand, intellectual property and material contracts. The company expects the acquisition to advance its goal of achieving a 10% share of Australia’s wagering market. Cash-scrip payment The bid consideration will be for an upfront $10m payment to co-founders Lloyd and Tristan Merlehan. This payment will consist of $7m cash and $3m worth of new BlueBet scrip to be issued at the same price as the capital raising announced concurrent to the bid. Deferred earn-out payments will also be made based on the net gaming revenue generated from TopSport customers in the first three years of BlueBet’s ownership. If these do not reach at least $5m over the first two years, BlueBet will make up the difference in cash, putting the guaranteed total consideration at $15m. Capital raising BlueBet will fund the cash component of the upfront payment with a $15m capital raising from its institutional investors via the issue of approximately 44.1 million shares at $0.34 each. The company will satisfy all other payments from its future cash reserves. BlueBet anticipates the acquisition will be significantly accretive for shareholders, promising more than 30% growth in earnings per share across the 2026 and 2027 financial years. TopSport chief executive officer Tristan Merlehan will join BlueBet’s executive team as chief trading officer on completion of the deal. Enhanced profitability BlueBet chief executive officer Andrew Menz said the TopSport acquisition would materially enhance the company’s profitability and scale. “Inorganic growth remains a key opportunity for us and we have a repeatable mergers and acquisitions model to drive shareholder value by further consolidating the Australian wagering market,” he said. “Tristan Merlehan is one of this country’s most respected bookmakers and will help strengthen our market-leading risk and trading capability, driving margin improvement and sustainable profitability for shareholders.” Suitable partner Mr Merlehan said TopSport had identified BlueBet as the most suitable partner following a thorough process. “BlueBet’s long-term record in customer migrations and scaling wagering businesses is unrivalled and I am pleased to play a key role in its bright future as we grow our share of the Australian market,” he said. “I am very proud of what we have achieved at TopSport, and our customers will continue to receive the same levels of service going forward, together with the benefits of a significant uplift in their wagering experience.” Betr merger The TopSport acquisition follows BlueBet’s April merger with online bookmaker betr, which aimed to create a larger and more competitive online wagering service for the Australian market. It resulted in a combined active customer base across both businesses of 179,000 and approximately 341,000 open accounts. Betr’s customers migrated to BlueBet’s proprietary technology platform to drive organic and inorganic growth, retention and monetisation.</p></span></div>",
