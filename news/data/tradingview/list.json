The Kors brand added too much fashion, alienating core customers. Versace removed too many unique statement items and reduced the number of lower-priced products. Idol says Kors will refocus on its heritage and plans to add a more balanced mix of products, while reducing some prices to be more in line with historical levels. Versace will add more products at the lower end of its price range to appeal to a broader base of consumers. (suzanne.kepner@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

He attributes this potential rise to two key factors: growing investor access and declining volatility.</p><p class=\"\">\"Access is improving under the [Donald] Trump administration,\" Kendrick, Standard Chartered's global head of digital assets research, told The Block in an email Wednesday. \"Institutional inflows will continue to gather pace. And vol will gradually come lower as the quality of flows improves and other infrastructure (eg. options markets) expand.\"</p><p class=\"\">These potential factors are \"enough to drive Bitcoin to $500,000 before Trump leaves office,\" Kendrick said.</p><p class=\"\">Bitcoin is currently trading at about $98,700, according to The Block's bitcoin price page.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Increasing investor access and decreasing volatility</strong></p><p class=\"\">Kendrick noted in a new report Wednesday that the launch of U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 has significantly expanded investor access, bringing in $39 billion in net inflows so far. He expects bitcoin's volatility to decline as the ETF market matures and as financial infrastructure improves — particularly with the expansion of options markets and institutional counterparties.</p><p class=\"\">Gold provides a useful comparison, Kendrick said, pointing to how its price surged 4.3 times after exchange-traded products (ETPs) were introduced in 2004. He expects bitcoin ETFs to follow a similar path but within two years instead of seven.</p><p class=\"\">\"As vol falls, Bitcoin's share of an optimized two-asset portfolio with gold increases,\" Kendrick said. \"Investor access and lower vol should lead to price appreciation longer-term as portfolios continue to move towards their optimal/logical state.\"</p><p class=\"\">Beyond the maturing ETF market, Kendrick sees further improvements under the Trump administration, particularly after the repeal of SAB 121, which lifted accounting restrictions for companies holding digital assets. He also pointed to Trump's executive order to evaluate a national digital asset stockpile, suggesting it could encourage central banks to consider bitcoin investments.</p><p class=\"\">“Given these developments, which are in line with our previous expectations, we continue to target BTC to reach the $200,000 level by year-end 2025. Thereafter, we see BTC reaching levels around $300,000 by end-2026, $400,000 by end-2027 and $500,000 by end-2028, remaining there until end-2029,” Kendrick concluded.</p><p class=\"\">Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

That puts some upside risk to the flash estimate GDP rebounded by only a modest 0.2% on-month in December after contracting 0.2% in November, he says.

America's trade in goods and services with the rest of the world showed a sharply increased deficit in December to just shy of $100 billion, according to Commerce Department figures set out Wednesday. Imports rose and exports declined. \"The strength of imports appears largely driven by businesses rushing orders ahead of potential tariffs, a trend unlikely to reverse any time soon,\" Ryan tells investors in a note.(joshua.kirby@wsj.com; @joshualeokirby)</p><p class=\"\">0901 ET - Euro-denominated investment-grade bonds appear attractive due to strong demand and since the issuers are in good financial health, analysts at Amundi Investment Institute say in a note. \"We favor euro financials and subordinated debt, and investment-grade bonds over high-yield bonds,\" Amundi says. The analysts are cautious on bonds with lower ratings like triple C bonds. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0901 ET - ADP's employment estimate indicates solid U.S. job growth in January. The payroll and HR-services provider figures that the economy added 183,000 jobs last month. It also sharply revises up its December estimate: now to 176,000, from 122,000 previously. Carl Weinberg and Mary Chen of High Frequency Economics warn that the ADP figure isn't a stellar predictor of official data, but say adds useful color. \"Right now, [the big picture] is one of still substantial increases in jobs by a fast-growing economy but a slowing trend in job creation,\" they write. \"Today's figures do not upset that trend.\" (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)</p><p class=\"\">0857 ET - Gold futures rise, keeping close to a fresh record set earlier in the session. Futures rise 0.2% to $2,880.80 a troy ounce, having hit $2,901.50 earlier in the day. Investors are increasingly seeking safe-haven in hard assets like gold, silver, copper and platinum, historically viewed as stores of value in times of financial uncertainty, Saxo Bank's Ole Hansen says in a note. The risk of sovereign debt crises, currency devaluations and systemic financial instability could further reinforce this trend, increasing the attractiveness of metals as a hedge against economic turbulence, Hansen writes. A shift away from U.S. dollar dominance is also underway as nations seek to reduce their greenback reliance for trade and reserve holdings, Hansen says. This is further supporting demand for gold and other stable commodities, as countries seek alternative to fiat currencies, he adds. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0857 ET - Goldman Sachs economists think the risks of tariff escalation remain very real. The bank's team now projects that the U.S. will enact a 10% global tariff on critical imports such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals as its baseline forecast, as well as a tariff on cars from the EU. If its current expected scenario is implemented, the tariffs could erase most progress on inflation otherwise expected this year, leaving core PCE inflation at 2.6% over the 12 months through December, Goldman projects. If Canada and Mexico tariffs are implemented after all, inflation would instead increase, peaking just above 3%, Goldman writes.

The decision to leave rates unchanged was almost completely priced in by the market but the central bank's restrictive policy stance over the past year is a key factor underpinning the zloty's strength, Capital Economics economist Nicholas Farr says. The NBP kept rates steady throughout 2024 and looks unlikely to cut rates in 2025 given the risk of higher inflation, he says. EUR/PLN last trades at 4.1991 after briefly falling to a low of 4.1931 after the decision from 4.1961 beforehand.

Meanwhile, U.S. trade deficit widens to $98.4 billion in December from November's revised $78.9 billion and versus a forecast of $96.8 billion in a WSJ survey.

Japanese wage growth data overnight was stronger than expected and BOJ former executive director Hideo Hayakawa told Bloomberg rates could rise more than markets predict. The summary of policymakers' opinions at the January BOJ meeting also signalled further rate rises. Rabobank retains a medium-term USD/JPY forecast of 145.00. USD/JPY falls 0.9% to 152.908, having earlier reached a near eight-week low of 152.555, according to FactSet.(renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0812 ET - European fixed income markets offer better value than bond markets in the U.S., given the high risk of inflation in the latter, Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management's Benjamin Melman says in a note. \"The global inflation no longer appears to be retreating, notably in the U.S., due to uncertainties surrounding the Trump administration's programme,\" the global chief investment officer says. In fixed income markets, there is more value to be found in Europe, on account of the much higher risks on inflation forecasts in the U.S., he says. Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management has a preference for 'carry' strategies in the current environment, as the yields on money market instruments are expected to fall this year, he says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0743 ET - The Bank of England is expected to cut interest rates on Thursday and it could signal another rate cut in March, Peel Hunt's Kallum Pickering says in a note. The BOE is likely to keep monetary policy guidance unchanged with one-per-quarter interest rate cut, Pickering says. \"However, risks are skewed towards policymakers signaling a willingness to react more forcefully to economic weakness,\" he says. Markets expect a total of 84 basis points of BOE interest rate cuts in 2025, LSEG Refinitiv data show. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

Stewart</p><p class=\"\">OTTAWA--Canada swung to a global trade surplus for the first time in 10 months at the end of last year as the local currency continued to weaken and energy shipments to the U.S. rose.</p><p class=\"\">The country posted a merchandise-trade surplus in December of 708 million Canadian dollars, the equivalent of about $494.3 million, Statistics Canada said Wednesday. That was narrower than the C$1.03 billion surplus expected by economists and comes after November's deficit was revised upward by C$663 million to C$986 million.</p><p class=\"\">The shift for the month still left Canada with a deficit with the world of about C$7.2 billion, much wider than the C$610 million shortfall the year before.</p><p class=\"\">The country's merchandise exports in December increased 4.9% to C$69.46 billion, while imports rose 2.3% to C$68.76 billion, the data agency said. For the year, imports advanced 1.9% to outpace a 1.0% lift in global exports.</p><p class=\"\">Economic growth in Canada picked up over the final quarter of last year following a string of interest rate cuts by the central bank since June as inflation has cooled. There remains a great deal of uncertainty over what 2025 will bring as the country braces for possible U.S. tariffs on imports from Canada.</p><p class=\"\">The rise in exports in December was the largest since last February, though the growth was due in part to the sharp depreciation of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar for a third month running, given a large portion of trade is completed in the U.S. currency. In volume terms, exports for the month were up 2.6% from November.</p><p class=\"\">Exports of energy products jumped 9.5% from the month before, with a rise in the value of crude oil. Exports of mineral products also rose strongly, and Canada shipped more motor vehicles and parts, as well as farm, fishing and intermediate food products for the month.</p><p class=\"\">In preparation for President Trump's threatened levies, some businesses accelerated shipments. A KPMG survey of 250 business leaders across Canada last month found 65% preemptively shipped goods or products ahead of Trump's inauguration and almost half have plans to shift investment and would set up operations or production south of the border to serve the U.S. market and reduce costs.</p><p class=\"\">Trump on Monday struck last-minute deals to delay by one month plans to levy hefty tariffs on Canada to see if in that time an \"economic deal\" with Canada can be structured. Trump has repeatedly complained about America's trade deficit with its northern neighbor.</p><p class=\"\">Statistics Canada's data showed Canada's long-standing surplus with the U.S. narrowed slightly last year to roughly C$102.2 billion from C$108.3 billion in 2023. Cross-border trade between the two countries topped the C$1 trillion mark for a third consecutive year in 2024, with the U.S. the destination for almost 76% of all exports and the source for some 62% of overall imports.</p><p class=\"\">Energy products remain the key to Canada's surplus with its neighbor. The country exported about C$176.2 billion of energy last year, roughly 88% of which went to the U.S.</p><p class=\"\">For December, Canada's exports to the U.S. were up 5.0% following a 6.7% rise the month before. The same month, imports of U.S. goods fell 1.5%, which widened the trade surplus between the countries to C$11.34 billion from C$8.19 billion in November.</p><p class=\"\">That came as Canada's deficit with countries other than the U.S. widened to roughly C$10.6 billion in December from C$9.2 billion the month before.</p><p class=\"\">When international trade in goods and international trade in services were combined, Canadian exports rose 4.1% in December, while imports increased 1.6%. As a result, Canada's trade incorporating both goods and services swung to a surplus of C$641 million in December from a C$1.43 billion deficit the month before.</p><p class=\"\">Combining both services and goods traded with the U.S. over the last year, and Canada recorded an overall trade surplus of about C$94.4 billion with its neighbor.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Robb M.
