Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires throughout the day.</p><p class=\"\">1047 ET - Shares of grain merchant and oilseed processor Bunge were down about 6% after the company reported a lower quarterly profit that missed analyst expectations because of supply gluts for crops and the meal and oil they are processed into. Bunge CEO told analysts on a call that the future for the agriculture market is hard to predict given the Trump Administration's threats of trade wars and what will happen to the U.S.' biofuels policies that drive the industry. \"We definitely are in an environment has less visibility than the normal with the trade disruptions and some of the uncertainty around U.S. biofuels,\" Heckman said. He added that the company's proposed acquisition of rival trader Viterra will help it weather any trade fights by increasing the company's ability to source crops from around the world. (patrick.thomas@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1034 ET - As the U.S. and Mexico grapple over tariff threats, Mexico is continuing to purchase U.S. corn exports — with the USDA confirming sales of 330,000 metric tons of corn for delivery to Mexico during the 2025/26 marketing year. Corn and soybean futures on the CBOT are lower in early trading, with the last-minute nature of agreements to delay implementing tariffs keeping investors in markets on edge. \"[His] eleventh-hour decision to delay the 25% tariffs he had threatened to impose on Canada and Mexico is a good reminder of his unpredictable nature,\" says Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics in a note, adding that the firm expects the Trump administration to move forward on a 10% universal tariff, as well as higher tariffs on Chinese goods. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1029 ET - GSK has to prove its pipeline is packed with new blockbuster treatments to withstand investors' concerns over its vaccine business slowdown in China and the U.S., AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould says. Further worries over the likely appointment of vaccine-sceptic Robert F Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services in the U.S. still linger, he says. The British pharma giant's posted a second consecutive drop in sales in the fourth quarter, driven by a 19% decline in sales of its flu shots and a 52% plunge for its respiratory treatment Arexvy. Shares are up 6.7% at 14.73 pounds.(helena.smolak@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0942 ET - U.S. farmers may see a significant price hike for fertilizer if Trump tariffs are implemented, as the materials used for fertilizer are often imported into the U.S, says Farmdoc Daily in a note. Potassium-based fertilizers may take the brunt, as 90% of U.S. consumption of potassium comes from imports. Canada is the leading producer of potash globally, and a tariff could add over $100 per ton for U.S. farmers to the current price tag around $450 a ton, says Farmdoc. Nitrogen fertilizers would also be impacted, although imports account for far less consumption, according to data from the U.S. Geological Survey. Nitrogen fertilizers are the most important for U.S. corn, while U.S. soybeans are often grown using potassium-based products. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0921 ET - U.S. ag traders are taking the lack of retaliatory tariffs from China on U.S. grain exports as a sign that a window for negotiations is open--but the lack of urgency coming from President Trump about negotiating with Chinese President Xi has grain traders nervous. \"Uncertain trade policy between the world's largest soybean importer and the world's second largest soybean exporter are in full display,\" says AgResource in a note. CBOT soybean futures are down 0.6% premarket. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0857 ET - Goldman Sachs economists think the risks of tariff escalation remain very real. The bank's team now projects that the U.S. will enact a 10% global tariff on critical imports such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals as its baseline forecast, as well as a tariff on cars from the EU. If its current expected scenario is implemented, the tariffs could erase most progress on inflation otherwise expected this year, leaving core PCE inflation at 2.6% over the 12 months through December, Goldman projects. If Canada and Mexico tariffs are implemented after all, inflation would instead increase, peaking just above 3%, Goldman writes. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)</p><p class=\"\">0847 ET - Oil futures are losing ground after an industry report of a large build in U.S. crude stocks, while the prospect of a trade war fuels concerns about demand. \"All of this tariff talk and general confusion that it's generating is bearish demand as companies can't expand if they don't know what their costs are or what they can sell their goods for,\" Scott Shelton of TP ICAP says in a note. The API reported a 5 million barrel increase in U.S. stocks for last week, analysts note. EIA data inventory are due later this morning, with a Wall Street Journal survey predicting a 1.3 million barrel build. WTI is off 1% at $71.97 a barrel and Brent is down 1.1% at $75.38 a barrel. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0844 ET - Treasury yields and the dollar weaken as Trump's Gaza takeover proposal squeezes the trade war out of today's headlines. ADP reports 183,000 jobs created by private employers in January, up from an upwardly revised 176,000 in December and higher than consensus of 150,000 in a Wall Street Journal survey. Meanwhile, U.S. trade deficit widens to $98.4 billion in December from November's revised $78.9 billion and versus a forecast of $96.8 billion in a WSJ survey. Yields and the WSJ Dollar Index moved up after the ADP data, before weakening again. The 10-year is at 4.458% and the two-year at 4.187%. The WSJ Dollar Index falls 0.3%.(paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)</p><p class=\"\">0812 ET - European fixed income markets offer better value than bond markets in the U.S., given the high risk of inflation in the latter, Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management's Benjamin Melman says in a note. \"The global inflation no longer appears to be retreating, notably in the U.S., due to uncertainties surrounding the Trump administration's programme,\" the global chief investment officer says. In fixed income markets, there is more value to be found in Europe, on account of the much higher risks on inflation forecasts in the U.S., he says. Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management has a preference for 'carry' strategies in the current environment, as the yields on money market instruments are expected to fall this year, he says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0705 ET - Euro credit looks more attractive and has more value to offer investors than U.S. credit, Benjamin Melman, global chief investment officer at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management, says in a note. The risk of inflation reaccelerating in the U.S. makes euro credit more attractive, Melman says. \"The new Trump administration has added an extra layer of uncertainty over the future path of inflation with its tariff and deportation policies,\" he says. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0606 ET - Gold futures rise, holding ground after setting a fresh record earlier in the session. Futures are up 0.6% at $2,892.70 a troy ounce, having reached $2,901.50 an ounce earlier in the day. The precious metal is gaining on a weaker U.S. dollar and growing concerns of an escalating U.S.-China trade war, and the likely hit to global economic growth prospects, ActivTrades' Ricardo Evangelista says in a note. The weaker dollar follows President Trump's last minute U-turn on imposing additional tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and disappointing U.S. labor and industrial data, Evangelista writes. At the same time, U.S. tariffs on China--and Beijing's response--are ominous for the global economy, increasing gold's safe-haven appeal. Demand is reinforced by further Middle East uncertainty, after Trump's comments about taking over Gaza and displacing the Palestinian population, Evangelista adds. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0519 ET - Bitcoin rises slightly but trades below the key $100,000 level amid uncertainty over President Trump's tariff plans. China's plans for retaliatory tariffs after Trump imposed a new 10% levy on Chinese imports add uncertainty to risky assets including cryptocurrencies, Saxo Bank analysts say in a note. Market sentiment is also muted after the Trump administration discussed the potential inclusion of bitcoin in a newly proposed U.S. sovereign wealth fund, sparking speculation over institutional adoption, they say. \"Traders remain focused on regulatory developments and macroeconomic shifts.\" Bitcoin rises 1.1% to $97,523, according to LSEG.

Dow executives several times on the call referred to a \"prolonged economic downturn.\" Eastman Chemical CEO Mark Costa gave a similar take on the company's recent analyst call. \"The macro economy is certainly challenging right now as we all know,\" he said.

Updated guidance reflects consensus expectations in terms of the capex cut, due to lower renewables spending. However, 2025 distributions are lower than expected and the outlook for 2026 distributions remains unclear, they say. The 2025 dividend and buyback of $9 billion is below consensus at $10 billion, while Equinor has scrapped its 2026 buyback guidance. Quarterly earnings beat consensus on net income but are relatively inline on the operating line and on cash flow from operations. Shares trade 3.5% lower at 268.20 Norwegian kroner.

Those living with a partner but unmarried face the highest struggle at over 75%. Single individuals often rely on one income, with 63% earning under $50,000 annually, versus 26% of married couples. Conversely, 29% of married people earn over $100,000, compared to just 7% of singles and 6% of divorced. Married couples benefit from tax advantages, enhancing financial stability. Despite these struggles, most pay on time, Redfin says.

That puts some upside risk to the flash estimate GDP rebounded by only a modest 0.2% on-month in December after contracting 0.2% in November, he says. Brown adds the situation for exporters finally improved, at least until President Trump came within hours of imposing a 25% tariff. \"That risk is likely to hang over the economy for some time.\" (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)</p><p class=\"\">0910 ET - A surge in the U.S. trade deficit points to businesses getting in orders ahead of the imposition of tariffs on imports, says Thomas Ryan, an economist at Capital Economics. America's trade in goods and services with the rest of the world showed a sharply increased deficit in December to just shy of $100 billion, according to Commerce Department figures set out Wednesday. Imports rose and exports declined. \"The strength of imports appears largely driven by businesses rushing orders ahead of potential tariffs, a trend unlikely to reverse any time soon,\" Ryan tells investors in a note.(joshua.kirby@wsj.com; @joshualeokirby)</p><p class=\"\">0901 ET - Euro-denominated investment-grade bonds appear attractive due to strong demand and since the issuers are in good financial health, analysts at Amundi Investment Institute say in a note. \"We favor euro financials and subordinated debt, and investment-grade bonds over high-yield bonds,\" Amundi says. The analysts are cautious on bonds with lower ratings like triple C bonds. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0901 ET - ADP's employment estimate indicates solid U.S. job growth in January. The payroll and HR-services provider figures that the economy added 183,000 jobs last month. It also sharply revises up its December estimate: now to 176,000, from 122,000 previously. Carl Weinberg and Mary Chen of High Frequency Economics warn that the ADP figure isn't a stellar predictor of official data, but say adds useful color. \"Right now, [the big picture] is one of still substantial increases in jobs by a fast-growing economy but a slowing trend in job creation,\" they write. \"Today's figures do not upset that trend.\" (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)</p><p class=\"\">0857 ET - Gold futures rise, keeping close to a fresh record set earlier in the session. Futures rise 0.2% to $2,880.80 a troy ounce, having hit $2,901.50 earlier in the day. Investors are increasingly seeking safe-haven in hard assets like gold, silver, copper and platinum, historically viewed as stores of value in times of financial uncertainty, Saxo Bank's Ole Hansen says in a note. The risk of sovereign debt crises, currency devaluations and systemic financial instability could further reinforce this trend, increasing the attractiveness of metals as a hedge against economic turbulence, Hansen writes. A shift away from U.S. dollar dominance is also underway as nations seek to reduce their greenback reliance for trade and reserve holdings, Hansen says. This is further supporting demand for gold and other stable commodities, as countries seek alternative to fiat currencies, he adds. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0857 ET - Goldman Sachs economists think the risks of tariff escalation remain very real. The bank's team now projects that the U.S. will enact a 10% global tariff on critical imports such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals as its baseline forecast, as well as a tariff on cars from the EU. If its current expected scenario is implemented, the tariffs could erase most progress on inflation otherwise expected this year, leaving core PCE inflation at 2.6% over the 12 months through December, Goldman projects. If Canada and Mexico tariffs are implemented after all, inflation would instead increase, peaking just above 3%, Goldman writes. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)</p><p class=\"\">0851 ET - The Polish zloty briefly rises to the highest level against the euro since April 2018 after the National Bank of Poland held interest rates at 5.75%. The decision to leave rates unchanged was almost completely priced in by the market but the central bank's restrictive policy stance over the past year is a key factor underpinning the zloty's strength, Capital Economics economist Nicholas Farr says. The NBP kept rates steady throughout 2024 and looks unlikely to cut rates in 2025 given the risk of higher inflation, he says. EUR/PLN last trades at 4.1991 after briefly falling to a low of 4.1931 after the decision from 4.1961 beforehand. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
