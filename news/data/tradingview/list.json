Stakers already benefitted from the decentralized protocol WOOFi, which gives 80% of transaction fees in the form of yield. This differentiates WOO as a token with value accrued from across centralized and decentralized finance.</p><p class=\"\">Over the past two weeks, WOO X has averaged $500M in daily trading volume, resulting in an additional 55,000 USDC set to be distributed to stakers on Feb. 10th. With WOOFi revenue added in, WOO stakers will share a pool of over a quarter of a million dollars - the bulk of which is being auto-compounded to buy back and stake onchain.</p><p class=\"\">To maximize your rewards, <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">stake more WOO today</strong> —increased stakes mean higher returns, and with the enhanced staking mechanics, WOO stakers will benefit from even greater value capture.

Trump postponed for a month tariffs on Canada and Mexico. </p><p class=\"\">A reduced tariff rate of 10% was to be applied to energy imports from Canada, compared to 25% on other goods, likely due to Canada being the U.S.' most important oil supplier, the bank noted. </p><p class=\"\">In 2024, the U.S. sourced more than 4 million barrels of its daily crude imports from Canada, equivalent to more than 60% of total U.S. crude imports. Mexico accounted for around 470,000 barrels per day (b/d) or, 7% of crude imports. </p><p class=\"\">Venezuela could have been considered as an alternative supplier due to proximity and comparable quality of oil, but Trump announced that the U.S. would no longer buy oil from Venezuela.
