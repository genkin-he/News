            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Joe Hoppe</p><p class=\"\">Gold demand hit a new record in 2024 driven by central banks and investors, according to a new report.</p><p class=\"\">Total gold demand rose 1% on-year to an all-time high of 4,974.5 metric tons, the World Gold Council said Wednesday in a new report on gold-demand trends. The value of that demand soared to a record $382 billion, driven by record-high prices on geopolitical and economic uncertainty and investors seeking out safe-haven assets.</p><p class=\"\">Gold demand was a record $111 billion in the fourth quarter. The healthy demand has persisted into the new year, helping continuous gold future prices hit a fresh record in late European trading on Tuesday of $2,877.10 a troy ounce. New York Mercantile Exchange gold futures are up around 8.9% in the year to date.</p><p class=\"\">\"Geopolitical uncertainty remains very high and that's always going to be a supportive element for investment--whether it's shifting from concerns of military conflict to uncertainties around trade conflicts,\" said Louise Street, senior markets analyst at the WGC.</p><p class=\"\">Central-bank demand--and emerging-market-bank demand in particular--was the greatest driver behind the increase, with buying exceeding 1,000 metric tons of the precious metal for the third year in a row. On an annual basis, central-bank demand declined 1%, but purchases rocketed 54% on-year in the fourth quarter, to 332.9 tons.</p><p class=\"\">Poland's central bank led purchases, adding 90 tons to its reserves, and central-bank demand is expected to stay high going into the new year, Street said.</p><p class=\"\">\"Geopolitical and economic uncertainty remains high in 2025 and it seems as likely as ever that central banks will once again turn to gold as a stable strategic asset,\" the report said.</p><p class=\"\">Gold investment also drove up demand, rising 25% on-year, to a four year high of 1,180 tons. Gold ETFs marked their first year since 2020 to avoid sizeable outflows, and in the fourth quarter, global gold-backed ETFs posted a second consecutive quarter of inflows--primarily driven by China and India in particular, Street said.</p><p class=\"\">Investment in gold was concentrated in the second half of the year as falling interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty and gold's continued strong price performance attracted inflows. Asian-listed funds led the charge, adding 78 tons of holdings over the year. North American funds added just 8 tons--though this was the first annual increase since 2020--while European funds saw outflows, albeit at a lower level on-year.</p><p class=\"\">Looking ahead, tailwinds for gold ETFs, over-the-counter purchases and futures-based investment are likely given expectations for lower global interest rates, high-valued equities, a weaker U.S. dollar and geopolitical risks through trade conflicts, the WGC said.</p><p class=\"\">On the other hand, gold demand for jewelry has fallen on year, driven by higher prices. Weakness was seen in every major region, with global demand falling 11%, driven by China and--to a lesser extent--India. Stripping out a coronavirus-pandemic-driven slump in 2020, gold-jewelry demand fell to its lowest level since 2009, the WGC said.</p><p class=\"\">\"If the gold price remains at current or higher levels, it could further erode jewelry demand, particularly as growth is also weak or slowing in all four major gold regions,\" the WGC said.</p><p class=\"\">Elsewhere, technology demand also rose 7%, to 326 tons, mostly driven by strong demand in AI-related applications and some recovery in the consumer-electronic markets.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Joe Hoppe at joseph.hoppe@wsj.com</p></span></div>",

The incentive schemes were established and originally announced on December 18, 2018.</p><p class=\"\">The objective of the share-based incentive schemes is to align the interests of the management and key employees with those of Alma Media's shareholders by creating a long-term equity interest for the participants and thus to increase the company's value in the long term as well as to drive a performance culture, to retain key resources and to offer them competitive compensation for excellent performance in the company.</p><p class=\"\">New period in the Matching Share Plan for senior management (MSP 2025)</p><p class=\"\">In the Matching Share Plan (MSP 2025), the participant will receive two matching shares for each invested share free of charge after a three-year holding period. Should all of the eligible individuals participate in MSP 2025 by making the required share investment, the maximum aggregate amount of matching shares to be delivered based on the fixed matching ratio is 241,400 shares (representing a gross reward from which the applicable payroll tax is withheld, and the remaining net value is paid to the participants in shares). The fixed matching shares will be delivered in the spring of 2028.</p><p class=\"\">In MSP 2025, the potential performance-based matching share rewards will be delivered to the participants after the three-year performance period in the spring of 2028 provided that the performance targets set by the Board of Directors for the plan are achieved.</p><p class=\"\">The performance targets applied to MSP 2025 are Alma Media's earnings per share (EPS), the relative total shareholder return of Alma Media's share (TSR) and ESG measures. If the performance targets set by the Board of Directors are achieved in full, the participant will receive in total six performance-based matching shares for each invested share free of charge. In that case, if all of the eligible individuals participate in MSP 2025 by making the required share investment, the maximum aggregate amount of performance-based matching shares delivered based on MSP 2025 is 724,200 shares (representing a gross reward from which the applicable payroll tax is withheld, and the remaining net value is paid to the participants in shares).</p><p class=\"\">The rewards based on MSP 2025 will be paid in shares of Alma Media Corporation.</p><p class=\"\">Eligible to participate in MSP 2025 are the members of Alma Media's Group Executive Team.</p><p class=\"\">The total value of MSP 2025 based on the current value of Alma Media's share is approximately EUR 11.4 million.</p><p class=\"\">The middle management's and selected key persons' Performance Share Plan (PSP 2025)</p><p class=\"\">The Performance Share Plan (PSP 2025) commences effective as of the beginning of 2025 and the potential share rewards thereunder will be paid in the spring of 2028 provided that the performance targets set by the Board of Directors for the plan are achieved. The potential rewards will be paid in shares of Alma Media Corporation.</p><p class=\"\">The performance targets applied to the PSP 2025 plan are the relative total shareholder return of Alma Media's share (TSR), EBIT of the participant's relevant business area and ESG measures.</p><p class=\"\">Eligible to participate in PSP 2025 are approximately 90 individuals at the maximum.</p><p class=\"\">If all of the performance targets set for PSP 2025 are achieved in full, the aggregate maximum number of shares to be paid based on this plan within the performance share structure is 306,000 shares (representing a gross reward from which the applicable payroll tax is withheld and the remaining net value is paid to the participants in shares).</p><p class=\"\">The total value of PSP 2025 based on the current value of Alma Media's share is approximately EUR 3.6 million.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Other terms and conditions</strong></p><p class=\"\">Both of the incentive schemes mentioned above are subject to a condition concerning the continuation of the service relationship. Accordingly, if a participant's service contract with Alma Media Group is terminated before the share-based reward is due to be paid, the participant is not, as a rule, entitled to the reward under the scheme.</p><p class=\"\">Alma Media applies a recommendation concerning share ownership to the members of the Group Executive Team. According to the recommendation, each member of the Group Executive Team is expected to retain ownership of at least half of the net shares received through the company's share-based incentive schemes until the total value of the Alma Media shares held corresponds to at least one year's fixed gross annual salary.</p><p class=\"\">The Board of Directors anticipates that no new shares will be issued in connection with the share-based incentive scheme. Consequently, the incentive scheme will have no dilutive effect on the number of the company's registered shares.</p><p class=\"\">ALMA MEDIA CORPORATION</p><p class=\"\">Board of Directors</p><p class=\"\">For more information, please contact: Mikko Korttila, General Counsel of Alma Media Corporation, secretary to the Board of Directors, tel. +358 50 593 4589</p><p class=\"\">Distribution: NASDAQ Helsinki Stock Exchange, main media, www.almamedia.com</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Alma Media in brief</strong></p><p class=\"\">Alma Media is an international company of digital media, marketplaces and services with a strong capacity for renewal.

Economists at HSBC and DBS had expected a reading of 5.0%.</p><p class=\"\">That continues a years-long run of growth at a roughly 5% clip, with Southeast Asia's largest economy having expanding at the same pace since about 2016, barring the Covid shock over 2020 and 2021.</p><p class=\"\">Indonesia's resource-rich economy grew 5.02% from a year earlier in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared with a 4.95% expansion in the third quarter. That exceeded economists' expectations, with a Wall Street Journal poll tipping growth at 4.89%.</p><p class=\"\">Things looked dimmer on a quarterly basis, with gross domestic product up just 0.53% in the fourth quarter compared with 1.50% the previous quarter.</p><p class=\"\">All business sectors grew on the year in the last three months of 2024, with the other services industry leading the gains in part thanks to international tourism, said Amalia Adininggar Widyasanti, acting chief of Statistics Indonesia.</p><p class=\"\">Manufacturing--the sector that makes up the biggest share of Indonesia's GDP--grew 4.89% from the prior-year period, she added.</p><p class=\"\">The main contributor to fourth-quarter GDP by expenditure was household consumption, followed by investments. Exports recorded strong growth too, driven by both non-gas and gas shipments.</p><p class=\"\">The data comes as President Prabowo Subianto looks to jumpstart growth during his five-year term. The former general, who was sworn in October last year, has set his sights high, aiming to bring GDP growth to 8%--levels it hasn't reached since the mid 1990s.</p><p class=\"\">To that end, the government has announced a multibillion-dollar stimulus package for 2025 and joined the BRICS organization as a full member in January, a move that could draw in more investment and trade.</p><p class=\"\">Parliament this week also approved the Daya Anagata Nusantara Agency for Investment Management, Indonesia's new sovereign wealth fund.</p><p class=\"\">Danantara, as the fund is known, is modeled after state investment entities like Singapore's Temasek and Norway's Norges Bank Investment Management, Citi Research analyst Ferry Wong said. Assets totaling about $600 billion place Danantara as one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds, with the aim of managing Indonesia's state-owned assets to bolster economic growth and enhance global competitiveness, he said in a note.</p><p class=\"\">The government is also looking to harness more of the country's abundant natural resources by requiring exporters to keep all proceeds onshore for at least one year.</p><p class=\"\">The repatriation regulation change, set to kick in March 1st, could strain businesses' cashflows but shows \"the government's commitment to bringing USD back onshore and boosting FX reserves, with expectations of up to US$90 billion in inflows,\" UOB economist Enrico Tanuwidjaja said.</p><p class=\"\">Increased onshore dollar liquidity is anticipated to boost foreign-exchange and bond market activity, and if a significant portion of the proceeds are converted into IDR, could strengthen the rupiah, he added in a report.</p><p class=\"\">But with trade uncertainties mounting, and Indonesia's economy vulnerable to commodity price shocks, it remains to be seen if the policy efforts will pay off.</p><p class=\"\">Current indicators suggest that economic growth will likely remain around 5% this year, ANZ economists Arindam Chakraborty and Sanjay Mathur said in a recent note. While the Indonesian government's focus on welfare-driven spending could help support consumption, the 2025 budget looks conservative, they added.</p><p class=\"\">Capital Economics' senior Asia economist, Gareth Leather, thinks growth has been accelerating, but is not as stable as official figures suggest.</p><p class=\"\">\"We expect growth to slow on our measure of activity as the impact of lower commodity prices and subdued global demand offsets the boost from lower interest rates,\" he said.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Ying Xian Wong at yingxian.wong@wsj.com</p></span></div>",
