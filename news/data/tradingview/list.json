            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Century Communities expects tariffs to have a greater impact on the remodel market, says Executive VP Jim Francescon in an interview. The Denver home builder adds that it's continuing to work with its suppliers but stressed that things remain fluid. \"Typically suppliers will keep a number of months of supply on hand. So if this is just a short-term negotiating tactic, the new home builders may not even feel it,\" says Francescon. While the U.S. paused plans for 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for one month, a 10% levy on imports from China went into effect today. Shares rise 2.2% to $76.29, recouping most of the previous sessions losses. (denny.jacob@wsj.com; @pennedbyden)</p></span></div>",

By integrating P4Q's high-performance electronics portfolio—including over 1 million solar controllers deployed across 2,400 solar sites globally—with Kinematics' installed base of 2.9 million solar actuators, the combined company becomes the world's largest supplier of motion control technology for solar trackers supporting more than 134 gigawatts of solar installations worldwide.</p><p class=\"\">Kinematics has gained P4Q’s expertise in full-stack electronics, including their market-leading tracker controls brand, Suntrack®, to complement its innovative actuation systems. This acquisition allows Kinematics to provide a complete solution for solar tracker motion technology, simplifying design integration and supply for solar tracker OEMs, enabling the most advanced tracking systems for future installations and providing asset owners a path toward upgrading outdated systems.</p><p class=\"\">\"This acquisition creates increased scale, expanded global support, and unified motion control solutions,\" said John Payne, CEO of Kinematics. \"By combining our strengths, we're setting new standards for intelligent solar tracking technology.

Innovation is in our DNA, and we will continue providing disruptive solutions to our clients as well as excellent service,” said Aitor Alapont, CEO of P4Q.</p><p class=\"\">A cornerstone of the combined offering is P4Q's revolutionary Self-Powered Plus (SPP) Controller Technology. This innovative solution eliminates the need for traditional pony panels, freeing up space on the tracker surface, and reducing both capital expenditure and installation complexity, while also offering superior power availability under low irradiance conditions.</p><p class=\"\">The acquisition builds on Kinematics' recent innovations in motion control, including the breakthrough ST Series actuators launched in 2024. Featuring a maintenance-free design, the ST Series delivers up to 50% more holding torque in a smaller form factor, enhancing solar tracker performance and reliability - capabilities that will be further strengthened through the integration of both companies.</p><p class=\"\">“This milestone will create synergies, expand our portfolio of products and services, and optimize our global operations, undoubtedly providing a significant boost to all our business verticals,” said Noemí Pérez, Commercial Director at P4Q.</p><p class=\"\">The combined company will be headquartered in the U.S. with R&amp;D in the U.S., Europe, and APAC.

March WTI traded as low as $70.67 in Tuesday dealings.</p><p class=\"\">\"Let's see if the selling can build, but it takes a brave soul to counter the move lower here,\" he said. \"And while the prospect of some sort of positive agreement is still in the playbook, for now, the more probable scenario is that both sides increase the friction.\"</p><p class=\"\">Meanwhile, the delay to the Mexico and Canada tariffs, particularly Canadian oil, served to pressure markets Monday and early Tuesday, said analysts at ING. Many U.S. refiners are dependent on the type of heavy crude oil produced by Canada and the threat of tariffs had led to a rally for oil and gasoline futures early in Monday's session, leading prices to finish well off the day's highs.</p><p class=\"\">Oil traders have also been concerned about plans by the the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, also known as OPEC+, to boost production after the first quarter.</p><p class=\"\">\"This strategy had been previously agreed upon to reduce the production cuts in place since 2022 progressively,\"? said Antonio Di Giacomo, senior market analyst at XS.com, in market commentary. \"However, the market's reaction has been adverse, reflecting investors' fears of a possible oversupply.\"</p><p class=\"\">\"The OPEC+ decision comes when doubts persist about the strength of the global economy and energy consumption levels in key markets such as China and the United States,\" he said.</p><p class=\"\">-Myra P.
