But should the required rate relief not come from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the risk of further ​job losses only grows, she says. The RBNZ's current forecasts suggest the OCR will get to 3.5% this year and no lower until deep in 2027. That will leave monetary conditions too restrictive, Vergara says. RBNZ will need to get the OCR down to 3% this year. Holding out longer will only cause unnecessary and indeed avoidable damage to the labor market, she adds.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Metallurgical test work on samples from Akora Resources’  flagship Bekisopa iron ore discovery in Madagascar has confirmed the ore’s upgrade potential and improved the company’s confidence in increasing the project’s mine life and tonnages. Bekisopa contains intermediate-grade direct shipping ore (DSO) mineralisation, which ranges in grade from 40% to 58% iron and typically sits adjacent to and underlying the identified high-grade DSO resource. The company prepared five samples from numerous drill core sections across the project’s northern, central and southern resource areas. Material upgrade Test work using basic dry magnetic separation techniques confirmed that material at a coarse crush product size averaging 52.8% iron could be upgraded to a lump product grading 59.2% at 80.8% recovery, while material averaging 50.3% iron could be upgraded to a 60.8% fines product at 88% recovery. The testing – part of the Bekisopa pre-feasibility study (PFS) due for release in March – provides the opportunity for Akora to include the intermediate material in an updated mineral resource estimate. The results support mineral processing tests in December confirming that Bekisopa’s lump and fines split could potentially deliver two DSO products to blast furnace steelmakers. Stage 1 DSO operation Akora is advancing plans to develop a Stage 1 DSO operation to produce up to 2 million tonnes per annum of high-grade lump and fines product from Bekisopa’s near-surface weathered zone mineralisation. Managing director Paul Bibby said ongoing workstreams for the PFS continue to show encouraging results and build on a robust scoping study released in November 2023. “The more lump iron ore product we can deliver, the better, as it is the preferred feed material for blast furnace steelmakers and the higher grades attract a premium price which would considerably enhance Bekisopa’s financials,” he said. “These upgraded results could add saleable lump and fines product tonnes and additional mine life to our DSO operation.”</p></span></div>",

Wilmar International rises 1.9%, Singapore Exchange adds 1.3% and Hongkong Land gains 1.3%. Meanwhile, Genting Singapore falls 1.3%, Venture Corp. sheds 0.8% and Seatrium loses 0.5%. (kimberley.kao@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">2007 ET - Malaysia's benchmark Kuala Lumpur Composite Index is 0.1% higher at 1565.68. The local bourse may trade rangebound this week amid a lack of fresh catalysts and continued foreign fund outflows, Apex Securities says in a note. While global sentiment improved after the U.S. tariff pause for Mexico and Canada, volatility may remain high, keeping investors cautious, the brokerage reckons. Bargain hunting may support the construction sector, while hospital operators and REITs could attract defensive interest amid market uncertainty, it adds. Among gainers, YTL Corp. adds 1.1% and Tenaga Nasional is up 0.9%. Meanwhile, Telekom Malaysia and Sunway Bhd. are each 0.9% lower.

Planters with greater upstream exposure in Indonesia should fare better due to better production, she reckons. Chye maintains her 2025-2026 CPO price assumptions at MYR4,000/ton and MYR3,800/ton, respectively, expecting elevated prices through 1Q amid weak output. Hong Leong maintains a neutral rating on Malaysian plantation sector as high CPO prices may not hold beyond 1Q. It has Johor Plantations, Hap Seng Plantations and IOI Corp. as its top picks.

The famous doll posted declining gross billings--which measures sales to retailers before adjustments--throughout 2024. This was largely due to a comparison to 2023 figures, which were highly inflated due to the blockbuster \"Barbie\" movie, Kreiz says. This year, though, the doll will face easier year-over-year comparisons, he says. And the company plans to optimize demand creation, release new products and lean further into momentum with adult fans. Mattel shares rise 10% after the company guides for higher profit and revenue in 2025.

It thinks Ingenia Communities's earnings guidance could beat consensus hopes on stronger sales. Analyst Howard Penny tips Goodman to update its data center pipeline, driving growth expectations. \"Stronger than consensus expected sales growth, and positive spreads could support growth\" for mall owner Scentre, Citi says. And turning to GPT, Citi expects its annual result to start \"setting a foundation for medium-term growth off a reasonable value.\" (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Dawn Gilbertson</p><p class=\"\">PHOENIX — Kimberly Mack took a free fear-of-flying class at Sky Harbor International Airport more than a decade ago and has relied on the tools she learned on every flight since.</p><p class=\"\">On Monday, the 54-year-old Arizona small-business owner called Ron Nielsen, the retired airline captain who runs the classes, for a one-on-one refresher. Mack has a flight to Napa, Calif., later this month and considered canceling after last week's devastating midair collision in Washington, D.C., and medical-jet crash in Philadelphia.</p><p class=\"\">The guy she calls \"Captain Ron\" reassured her in a call that stretched over an hour. \"He's not like: Your fears aren't valid. You have to remember things happen. It reiterated everything.\"</p><p class=\"\">You don't have to be a nervous flier to be suddenly anxious about airline safety. The American Airlines-Black Hawk helicopter crash, which killed 67 people, was the worst aviation incident on U.S. soil in a generation. Frequent fliers as well as casual travelers are talking about it with their families and co-workers and airline crews are stunned.</p><p class=\"\">Nielsen, who runs a Phoenix-based business called Fearless Flight and has a master's degree in professional counseling, saw it at his latest free airport class on Saturday night. He says a third of the attendees signed up because of the accident.</p><p class=\"\">\"It doesn't make people afraid but it elevates the fears that they've been repressing,\" he says. \"It activates their fear-of-flying gene.\"</p><p class=\"\">Dial a Pilot, an 18-month-old business run by a major airline pilot, has seen a \"massive surge\" in bookings for its $65, 30-minute sessions. \"The calls were not necessarily centered on the accident, they were more centered on: I have this one fear. Is it valid?\" says founder Kyle Koukol.</p><p class=\"\">It is. But while I can help you navigate annoying airline seat fees, airport lounge restrictions and pesky carry-on bag rules, I'm not the right person to soothe your frayed flying nerves. That's for the professionals.</p><p class=\"\">So I turned to Nielsen, Koukol and licensed therapists for their coping strategies, though each said they don't love dashing off tips because there is no one-size-fits-all strategy.</p><p class=\"\">\"It's such a complex problem,\" Nielsen says, but there are ways to manage your anxiety.</p><p class=\"\">Stop doom scrolling and do a reality check</p><p class=\"\">Nathan Feiles, a licensed therapist and fear-of-flying specialist in New York City, says major airline accidents tend to put a spotlight on all types of airline incidents that follow — no matter how routine, like a flight returning to an airport.</p><p class=\"\">\"It creates a sense of reverse normalization,\" he says. \"It starts to make people think that there's a lot more danger happening.\"</p><p class=\"\">Yes, this crash was awful. But flying is still the safest form of transportation.</p><p class=\"\">To help put things in perspective, Brenda Wiederhold, a licensed clinical psychologist in San Diego, recommends patients scroll the departure boards for an airport (online is fine) to see the flurry of flights that take off and land day in, day out.</p><p class=\"\">She asks frequent fliers, \"Have you ever not landed safely?\"</p><p class=\"\">Then she asks them how many times they've had a fender bender. If they say two or three she responds, \"You still get in your car and drive.\"</p><p class=\"\">Don't self-medicate just to board a plane</p><p class=\"\">Downing several drinks or popping a few pills before boarding a flight might help temporarily but it can become a crutch.</p><p class=\"\">Travelers need to address the underlying fear rather than put it off, Wiederhold says.</p><p class=\"\">\"You're telling yourself, 'I can't do this,'\" she says. \"I'm saying you will make it worse by avoiding it. The monster gets bigger, the fear gets bigger.\"</p><p class=\"\">Use anxiety-management tools</p><p class=\"\">Deep breathing is a big one, of course.</p><p class=\"\">Nielsen is a big fan of distanced self-talk, a technique promoted by Ethan Kross, an experimental psychologist and neuroscientist and director of the Emotional and Self Control Lab at the University of Michigan. He wrote the book \"Chatter: The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It.\"</p><p class=\"\">The bottom line: You distance yourself emotionally from a situation. Nielsen says travelers can reframe a flight situation that scares them, like turbulence, by writing, \"I hate this but I've been here before and I lived\" over and over.</p><p class=\"\">\"You're changing from negative cognitions to positive cognitions,\" he says.</p><p class=\"\">Find your community and feed off each other</p><p class=\"\">I found this to be the most practical and widely applicable advice for those without severe phobias.</p><p class=\"\">You'll get no shortage of online recommendations, but the key is to find the right fit. Scrolling through Reddit travel threads, including its Fear of Flying subreddit, I found recommendations as basic as watching videos on airplanes or perversely bingeing episodes of National Geographic's \"Air Crash Investigation.'</p><p class=\"\">Dial a Pilot clients who join its No Fear Flight Club get access to an online forum where members share coping mechanisms. Koukol finds it fascinating that a lot of the tips revolved around time. One client counts to 30 over and over again until the turbulence stops.</p><p class=\"\">\"That's kind of her way of just taking the power away from the turbulence,\" he says.</p><p class=\"\">A couple of months ago, Taylor Swift entered the fearful flying lexicon when a client who overcame her fear of flying and is now training to be a pilot mentioned she listens to the 10-minute version of \" All Too Well\" on repeat.</p><p class=\"\">Katherine Morgan, a 31-year-old bookstore owner in Portland, Ore., has her own routine to fight off flight jitters and paid extra attention to it on a Saturday flight to San Diego. She kisses the plane when boarding, reads a romance novel because she knows the ending will be happy and orders a ginger ale.</p><p class=\"\">\"It gives me some kind of feeling of control.\"</p><p class=\"\">Write to Dawn Gilbertson at dawn.gilbertson@wsj.com</p></span></div>",
