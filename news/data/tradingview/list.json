Trump's plan to talk with Beijing raised hopes for a U.S.-China tariff reprieve, FSMOne analyst Alwyn Chew Chuan Shyn says. For now, the market doesn't seem too concerned that China announced retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods, he adds. Still, Chew expects volatility in the local market to rise as investors closely monitor the U.S. and Malaysian earnings seasons and Trump's foreign policies. He sees support for the KLCI at 1535 and resistance at 1590. Among gainers, CIMB Group rose 2.4% and Sunway Bhd. climbed 2.3%.

The housebuilder has guided for volumes in 2025 to be similar to 2024 despite the forward order book being down 40% when compared to last year, with guidance overall cautious as most of the recovery is expected to come in 2H, Creasey says.

(anthony.orunagoriainoff@dowjones.com)</p><p class=\"\">0914 GMT - BNP Paribas reported strong underlying trends for the fourth quarter and consensus expectations could rise, RBC Capital Markets analyst Anke Reingen says in a research note. The French bank's quarterly result as well as it CET1 ratio exceeded expectations, the analyst says. The bank's new 2024-2026 net income growth rate target suggests at least a 4% consensus upgrade, Reingen says. The slight fall in the bank's 2025 return on tangible equity to 11.5% from a range of 11.5% to 12% previously, given consensus expectations at 10.4%, should offer relief to investors fearing a steeper downgrade. BNP Paribas' targeted revenue growth of at least 5% per year for 2025-2026 is also higher than investors had expected. BNP shares trade 2.5% higher to 65.94 euros.

The company's commercial, personal banking and services division also drove the 4% consensus beat, the analyst says. BNP Paribas's investment and protection services unit disappointed but the business should benefit later this year from external growth, the analyst says. Meanwhile, the bank's targets for 2026 are slightly ahead of consensus, the analyst says. BNP Paribas shares trade 2.7% higher at 66.09 euros.

Deside notes that projections for both periods are about 2% below consensus. Dassault Systemes shares trade 0.2% lower at 37.29 euros. (mauro.orru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0853 GMT - Diageo's 1H performance was satisfactory and likely exceeded market expectations, with signs of stabilization as sales were up by 1% and profits down by 1%, Quilter Cheviot's Chris Beckett says. Diageo's decision to remove medium-term guidance of 5%-7% organic sales growth might upset some investors. However, this move is acceptable given that the target was laid during the pandemic--when demand for alcohol was exceptionally high--and unrealistic given the current environment, Beckett writes in a note. Additionally, the owner of Johnnie Walker, Guinness and Smirnoff seems to be effectively managing its significant debt, given that the dividend remained unchanged amid concerns of a potential cut, Beckett says. Diageo's 2H performance is likely to be similar if U.S. tariffs are not imposed, he adds. Shares are down 3.3% and nearly 20% over the last 52 weeks.

With volatility set to remain, there may be chances for investors to cash in on market overreactions, especially if Trump's tariff threats are a bluff, the analyst says. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 trades down 0.4%.

The owner of Johnnie Walker, Guinness and Smirnoff reported a positive performance for the first half, ahead of market expectations. Meanwhile, full-year guidance reflects a sequential increase in organic sales growth and a slight decline in organic EBIT, the analysts write in a note. The guidance removal is welcome as it led to unrealistic investor expectations and sub-optimal management decisions designed to support an unfeasible growth aspiration. The target has been replaced by more comprehensive short-term guidance with the promise of improved productivity efforts and tighter capital discipline, they say. Shares are down 2.7% and nearly 20% over the 52-week period.

The London-listed recruitment-and-training group posted earnings before interest and taxes and net cash ahead of expectations, despite market concerns to the contrary, Panmure Liberum says. The company's U.K. recruitment business is gaining market share through deeper penetration of customers and new customers wins, the analysts say. Staffline's Ireland recruitment business is relatively stable, they add. Meanwhile, the PeoplePlus division has suffered delays but still benefits from a strong pipeline, the investment bank adds.

The bulk of the banks' earnings, which remain supported by net interest income, is expected to stay resilient amid the high-for-longer interest rate environment, he writes. The banks' 4Q loan momentum may also see some pick-up, with data suggesting that overall loans have risen in December from November, he says. Higher confidence around the economy with Singapore's low unemployment rate could have partly contributed to an improvement in lending conditions, Yeap adds. (amanda.lee@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
