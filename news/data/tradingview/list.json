            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Canada's merchandise trade balance tallied a first-in-ten-month surplus of C$708 million in December, while November's deficit was revised higher to C$986 million from $323 million reported earlier, noted TD on Wednesday. </p><p class=\"\">Merchandise exports accelerated to 4.9% month on month from 1.9% in November, with gains reported by eight out of 11 sectors. Energy exports, driven by higher crude oil prices, were once again the biggest driver of exports, accelerating to 9.5% month over month. Exports of metal and non-metallic mineral products (+9.2% month over month) and motor vehicles and parts (+3.9%) also added admirably to the headline tally. </p><p class=\"\">Merchandise imports also moved higher for a third straight month, up by 2.3% month over month in December. The biggest gains came from consumer goods (+4.7% month over month), metal and non-metallic mineral products (+8.7%) and industrial machinery (+5.0% m/m). </p><p class=\"\">In volume terms, merchandise exports rose by 2.6% month over month while imports edged higher by 0.2%. </p><p class=\"\">Canada's merchandise trade surplus with the United States widened to C$11.3 billion in December from C$8.2 billion the month prior. </p><p class=\"\">Trade finished the quarter on a strong note, with goods likely providing an improved trajectory for Q4 gross domestic product growth, stated TD. Trade-related uncertainty has likely led companies to stockpile inventories, temporarily boosting trade. </p><p class=\"\">Statistics Canada's ongoing transition in trade-related data means these figures should be interpreted with caution, pointed out the bank. </p><p class=\"\">While the immediate threat of U.S. tariffs on Canadian exports has been delayed until next month, the outlook remains uncertain as tariffs are still on the table, added TD. Any future tariffs will have negative consequences for economic growth, though the ultimate effect will depend on depth, breadth, duration and retaliation.</p></span></div>",

Organic growth declined by 0.5%, but excluding the Product Line Simplification (PLS) reduction, organic growth was positive at 0.4%. The company achieved a record operating margin of 26.2%, an increase of 140 basis points, and a GAAP EPS of $2.54, up 7% from the previous year.</p><p class=\"\">For the full year 2024, revenue was $15.9 billion, a decrease of 1.3% from 2023. Organic growth declined by 0.7%, but was flat when adjusted for the PLS reduction.

Notably, the Welding segment achieved an operating margin of 32.3%, and the Specialty Products segment reached 30.3%. The company also generated record free cash flow of $1 billion in the fourth quarter and $2.8 billion for the full year, with a conversion rate of 133% and 94% to net income, respectively.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments</strong></p> <p class=\"\">During the fourth quarter, ITW repurchased $375 million of its own shares and returned $3.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases for the full year. The company also benefited from a $1.26 per share gain from the sale of its equity interest in Wilsonart and a $0.30 per share gain from a LIFO inventory accounting change.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Management's Perspective</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Christopher A.

The company expects a GAAP EPS range of $10.15 to $10.55, including a $0.30 headwind from foreign currency translation.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">BURLINGAME, Calif., Feb.  05, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — In an industry-defining moment, Accumulus Synergy (“Accumulus”) has powered Amgen’s groundbreaking regulatory submission: the first-ever, digitally generated Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) Post Approval Change (PAC) dossier, delivered to the Reference Country and nearly two dozen participating Reliance countries, simultaneously. This transformative achievement aims to redefine the regulatory landscape by accelerating global approvals while setting a new benchmark for transparency and efficiency.</p><p class=\"\">Leveraging the Accumulus platform, the digitally generated dossier created by Amgen using its proprietary AI and novel Structured Content and Data Management (SCDM) software is being reviewed by the Reliance Reference Country and all participating regulators at the same time. This means that every jurisdiction involved has real-time access to all regulatory information, from submission details to ongoing questions, answers, and updates, as it becomes available. This transparency not only has the potential to accelerate review timelines but also to pave the way for a fully digital regulatory ecosystem.</p><p class=\"\">“For the first time ever, sponsors are able to submit a single, digital, global dossier to multiple regulators around the world with just a click of a button,” said Francisco Nogueira, CEO of Accumulus. “The Accumulus platform isn’t just a technological advancement, it’s a reimagining of regulatory processes which could ultimately lead to patients receiving the treatments they need sooner.”</p><p class=\"\">With this submission, Accumulus and Amgen have taken a crucial first step in redefining the Reliance concept. Unlike conventional Reliance projects where regulators must wait for the Reference Country’s completed review to gain access to critical data, Amgen is utilizing the Accumulus platform to democratize information in real-time to all participating regulators, equipping all stakeholders with the same information at the same time.</p><p class=\"\">Leveraging the Accumulus platform’s cutting-edge digital innovation and the transformative power of Reliance pathways, Accumulus and Amgen are working to minimize CMC variances caused by lengthy registration timelines and diverging regulatory requirements, addressing one of the most persistent challenges in global regulatory filings. This approach aims to realize more efficient review and approval timelines, the return of facility capacity to sponsors, and accelerated access of medicines to patients globally.</p><p class=\"\">“As a company dedicated to innovation, this is a proud moment for Amgen. Simultaneous regulatory submissions through the cloud could lead to faster reviews, approvals, and accelerated access to medicines for patients who need new treatment solutions,” said Mark Taisey, Senior Vice President Global Regulatory Affairs, Amgen. “Using Amgen’s proprietary AI and SCDM software, we are looking forward to the next step in the industry’s digital evolution. By moving to cloud-based digital dossiers, we’re unlocking the true potential of digital transformation in regulatory collaboration. Democratized access to information ensures that every country, regardless of its role in the Reliance process, has the tools and data needed to drive faster decisions.”</p><p class=\"\">“As Accumulus continues to lead the charge in global regulatory transformation, it remains committed to creating a faster, more transparent, and collaborative future,” added Nogueira. “We’re not just talking about the future of regulatory submissions; we’re actively creating it. Our Platform is reshaping how information is shared, how regulators and industry collaborate, and how approval timelines are accelerated, all with an unwavering commitment to the highest standards of compliance and security.”</p><p class=\"\">About Accumulus Synergy</p><p class=\"\">Accumulus Synergy is a global, nonprofit industry association developing a transformative data exchange platform that aims to enable enhanced collaboration and efficiency between life sciences organizations and global Regulatory Authorities while also affording users the ability to extract dynamic, data-driven insights. Accumulus is working with key stakeholders in the life sciences – regulatory ecosystem to build and sustain a platform that aims to meet regulatory, cybersecurity, and privacy requirements spanning clinical, safety, chemistry, and manufacturing and regulatory exchanges and submissions.
