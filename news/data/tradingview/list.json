The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a \"band,\" around a central reference rate, or \"midpoint.\" It's currently at +/- 2%. </p><p class=\"\">How the process works:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Daily midpoint setting: Each morning, the PBOC sets a midpoint for the yuan against a basket of currencies, primarily the US dollar.

The midpoint serves as a reference point for that day's trading.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">The trading band: The PBOC allows the yuan to move within a specified range around the midpoint. The trading band is set at +/- 2%, meaning the yuan could appreciate or depreciate by a maximum of 2% from the midpoint during a single trading day. This range is subject to change by the PBOC based on economic conditions and policy objectives.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Intervention: If the yuan's value approaches the limit of the trading band or experiences excessive volatility, the PBOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling the yuan to stabilize its value.

Volcon electric vehicles are the future of off-roading, not only because of their environmental benefits but also because of their near-silent operation, which allows for a more immersive outdoor experience.</p><p class=\"\">Volcon's vehicle roadmap includes both motorcycles and UTVs. Its first product, the innovative Grunt, began shipping to customers in late 2021 and combines a fat-tired physique with high-torque electric power and a near-silent drive train. The Volcon Grunt EVO, an evolution of the original Grunt with a belt drive, an improved suspension, and seat, began shipping to customers in October 2023. The Brat is Volcon's first foray into the wildly popular eBike market for both on-road and off-road riding and is currently being delivered to dealers across North America. In 2024, Volcon entered the rapidly expanding LUV and UTV market and shipped its first production MN1 unit in October 2024. The new MN1 and HF1 products empower the driver to explore the outdoors in a new and unique way that gas-powered units cannot. They offer the same thrilling performance of a standard LUV / UTV without the noise (or pollution), allowing the driver to explore the outdoors with all their senses.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Forward-Looking Statements</strong></p><p class=\"\">Some of the statements in this release are forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties.

Still, only 10% of investments by Corio--Macquarie's unit focused on offshore wind-energy developments--are in the U.S. and exposed to policy shifts by the Trump administration. \"Elsewhere, we estimate Macquarie booked a A$50 million gain on sale of Formosa 2 offshore wind in Asia, so offshore wind transactions are continuing,\" Morgan Stanley says. \"Nonetheless, we have baked in a A$150 million 2H impairment charge for principal investments in renewables.\" (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)</p><p class=\"\">1814 ET - California increased its minimum wages for fast-food workers last year, prompting restaurants to increase prices and hurt their sales in the process. Chipotle Mexican Grill said sales in its restaurants and across the industry remain depressed in the state as a result. Chipotle said it's holding off additional price increases for now beyond a nationwide 2% increase taken in December. (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)</p><p class=\"\">1724 ET - Brambles may disappoint some investors by deciding against upgrading its annual guidance at its first-half result announcement, according to its bull at UBS. Analyst Andre Fromyhr writes in a note that the stronger U.S. dollar makes Brambles' free cashflow guidance more challenging than when it was announced. Even so, he expects the global pallet giant to maintain guidance. Fromyhr reckons that Brambles needs to consistently deliver US$800 million annual free cashflow without strong price growth or dropping capex before the stock rerates further. UBS lifts its target price 18% to A$22.50 and keeps a buy rating on the stock, which is at A$19.26 ahead of the open. (stuart.condie@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

The main theme overnight was relief in the markets after Trump's decision to pause tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days, and China's cautious response to the tariffs, the Commerzbank research team writes in a note. This helped support sentiment and eased market concerns about an all-out tit-for-tat trade war, Commerzbank adds. Wilmar International rises 1.9%, Singapore Exchange adds 1.3% and Hongkong Land gains 1.3%. Meanwhile, Genting Singapore falls 1.3%, Venture Corp. sheds 0.8% and Seatrium loses 0.5%.

Here are some details about three of them. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) declined to comment. </p><p class=\"\">GAVIN KLIGER</p><p class=\"\">Gavin Kliger, who lists his job on Linkedin as “Special Advisor to the Director @ OPM”  since January, graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 2020 with a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and boasting a 3.95 grade point average, according to the platform. </p><p class=\"\">Kliger, pictured donning a \"Make America Great Again\" hat on his profile page on social media platform X, was most recently a senior Software Engineer at San Francisco, California-based AI Startup Databrinks and served in a similar role at Twitter in 2019, his Linkedin Profile shows.</p><p class=\"\">His Substack features essays entitled “the Curious Case of Matt Gaetz: How the Deep State Destroys its Enemies” in which he describes Gaetz as “a congressman who was never charged with a crime... forced from office through the coordinated efforts of the intelligence community, the DOJ, establishment Republicans, and a media complex more interested in headlines than truth,\" a scenario that echoes Trump's own trevails, he claims.  </p><p class=\"\">Another essay, called “Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense: The Warrior Washington Fears,” argues the controversial appointee represents “a direct challenge to the entrenched power brokers who have spent decades turning the Pentagon into a revolving door for defense contractors and corporate lobbyists.”</p><p class=\"\">A third essay, titled \"Why DOGE\" with the subtitle \"Why I gave up a seven-figure salary to save America\" is available only to paid subscribers. </p><p class=\"\">Kliger did not respond to a request for comment, but reposted an Elon Musk post on X on Feb 3, saying \"Time to confess: Media reports saying that @DOGE has some of world’s best software engineers are in fact true.\"</p><p class=\"\">U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Musk head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) project.</p><p class=\"\">LUKE FARRITOR</p><p class=\"\">Luke Farritor is a former intern at SpaceX, Musk’s space company, where he worked 10 hour days writing software for the pumps, valves and other components that help fuel rockets, according to an article posted on the website of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where Farritor studied computer science. </p><p class=\"\">Farritor was part of an award-winning team that deciphered portions of an ancient Greek scroll, a Linkedin Post shows. He is also a Thiel Fellow, last year winning $100,000 and access to a network of tech founders, investors, scientists, and former fellows to focus on his Greek scroll project. </p><p class=\"\">According to the New York Times, Farritor, was among the workers given access to USAID systems. He is also listed as an “executive engineer” in the office of the secretary of health and human services, and had an email account at the General Services Administration (GSA), the paper reported. The GSA is a federal government agency that manages federal property and provides contracting services.</p><p class=\"\">Musk’s aides, including Farritor, have requested access to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services systems that control contracts and the more than $1 trillion in payments that go out annually, according to the Times.</p><p class=\"\">Farritor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p class=\"\">EDWARD CORISTINE</p><p class=\"\">According to Wired magazine, Edward Coristine appears to have recently graduated from high school and to have been enrolled at Northeastern University. He also spent three months at Neuralink, Musk’s brain-computer interface company, last summer, the magazine added. </p><p class=\"\">Coristine is listed in internal OPM records as an \"expert\" at OPM, Wired reported. </p><p class=\"\">A Connecticut registry of businesses shows that an Edward Coristine created three tech or computer-related firms that list as a principle place of business a New Canaan, Connecticut home, valued by Zillow at over $2.4 million. One of them, Tesla.Sexy LLC, dedicated to \"Professional, Scientific and Technological services,\" appears to still be in operation. </p><p class=\"\">Web-based platform Github, which allows developers to store, share and collaborate on code, shows an Eduard C as the only \"member\" of Diamond CDN — one of the now dissolved Connecticut-based companies founded by Coristine. The same Eduard C, who describes himself as a technologist who is \"passionate about improving humanity!\" has contributed to Neuralink's code base, according to the platform.</p><p class=\"\">Coristine did not immediately respond to requests for comment.     </p></span></div>",
