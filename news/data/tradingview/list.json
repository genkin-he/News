French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou pushed the 2025 budget bill without a vote by lawmakers, and faces a no-confidence vote. Using a constitutional tool to pass the bill \"was what led to fall of the previous French government,\" the fixed income research director says. \"Hence, there is still some considerable risks to being long France even at spread of some 75 basis points in the 10-year area to Germany,\" Sorensen says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0642 GMT - Higher tariffs have the potential to increase inflation in the short term if companies pass the costs on to their customers, says Damian McIntyre at Federated Hermes. However, this is unlikely to impact central bank policy in the longer term, says the head of multi-asset solutions in a note. \"We would expect this to be a one-off impact of inflation, rather than a sustained increase,\" he says. In the short term, this could keep rates higher for longer, he adds. Federated Hermes, however, does not expect it to have long-term implications for central bank policy. U.S. President Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Canada reached a deal to put tariffs on hold for a month. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0633 GMT - China's retaliation to Trump's tariffs doesn't seem aggressive, says Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. Beijing's measures only target some U.S. products, whereas the U.S. tariffs apply to all Chinese exports to the country, says Zhang. \"This is likely only the beginning of a long process for the two countries to negotiate,\" the economist says. The negotiations between the U.S. and its neighbors suggest that there is some hope of de-escalation at some point, though the road ahead is likely to be bumpy, Zhang says. Washington postponed tariffs on Canada and Mexico after reaching border-related deals.

These are now now playing out, potentially causing more volatility in rates markets, says Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy. \"This is likely a source for increased volatility in the rate market more so than serious disruption for companies and equities, but this is early days,\" he says in a note. U.S. President Trump moved to levy tariffs on Mexico and Canada, but the leaders of the three states reached an agreement to put tariffs on hold for a month. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0437 GMT - The real impact of U.S. tariffs is too early to determine, according to Stephen Dover, chief market strategist and head of the Franklin Templeton Institute, in a commentary. It is unclear whether these tariffs are a long-term policy or a negotiation tactic by President Trump to secure concessions, the strategist notes. At the margin, these tariffs should encourage more domestic production of goods in the United States. However, the uncertainty surrounding the permanence of these tariffs makes it challenging for companies to make informed capital investment decisions, Dover adds. Chinese policymakers and businesses are likely to implement measures to mitigate the impact should the situation escalate further, Dover notes. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0431 GMT - China could ramp up foreign direct investment in 2025 to ease the impact of higher U.S. tariffs on its exports and the broader economy, ANZ economists say in a research note. Chinese companies have invested heavily in third countries like Mexico since the initial U.S.-China trade dispute in 2018. According to China's commerce ministry, 326 Chinese enterprises registered to invest in Mexico in 2023, up from 133 in 2020. The economists think the trend is not only tariff driven, but also due to supply chain shifts. \"Low industrial profit under overcapacity concerns and relatively high production costs drives supply-chain shift overseas,\" they say. ANZ expects more overseas investment from Chinese companies to reduce reliance on traditional markets and diversify trade influence, they add. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0415 GMT - There are high hopes that China may strike a deal with President Trump to delay the additional 10% tariff, after Mexico and Canada managed to delay the U.S. tariffs, says IG. However, there is \"still room for surprises and Trump could still come down hard\", market strategist Yeap Jun Rong writes in a note. China is seen as a prominent threat to U.S. national security and economic competition, Yeap notes. The tech rivalry between the two countries has become even more pronounced recently with Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, he adds. \"But if China can pull it off, risk sentiments may find further recovery momentum, at least in the near term,\" Yeap says.(amanda.lee@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0410 GMT - Indonesia's economy is expected to have grown 4.89% in 4Q 2024, slightly easing from 3Q's 4.95%, according to the median estimate of six economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. Growth was likely supported by a modest uptick in demand, despite slower investment growth amid the transition to a new head of state, DBS economists Taimur Baig and Nathan Chow say in a note. The 4Q outcome would peg 2024 growth at an average of 5%, maintaining a steady pace from 2023, they add. Indonesia's 2023 GDP growth was 5.05%. The data is due Wednesday.

The U.S. tariffs on Mexico and Canada have been delayed for a month, so market participants are anticipating that Trump will do the same for China, Maybank analysts say in an FX Research &amp; Strategy report. \"Markets are now awaiting verdict on the last outstanding tariffs for China that could come into effect within hours,\" the analysts say. However, given recent choppy movements, the USD Index remains at the \"whims of tariff headlines,\" the analysts add. USD/SGD is 0.1% lower at 1.3591.

President Trump mentioned overnight that the U.S. might speak with China, likely within the next 24 hours, regarding tariffs, notes Mizuho Securities Asia's Ken Cheung in an email. Trump's comments revived hopes for a pause in U.S. tariffs on China, similar to the situation with Canada and Mexico, according to the director of FX Strategy. However, with mainland China still closed for holiday today, the USD/CNY fixing guidance on Wednesday will be closely monitored, Cheung adds. USD/CNH is little changed at 7.3114. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0339 GMT - Australia's core inflation remains high and the economy is fully employed, but global risks should make the Reserve Bank of Australia more dovish, say economists at HSBC Global Research. The escalation of trade tensions creates downside risk for the global economy and the scale and breadth of tariffs on products and countries suggest the impact is likely to be significant, say Paul Bloxham and Jamie Culling in a note. They reckon this is enough to tip the RBA's view to start supporting the economy a little earlier than expected. HSBC now sees the RBA cutting its cash rate by 25 bps this month, with another cut expected in 3Q and a final cut in the current cycle in 1Q 2026. (monica.gupta@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

Also, the Thailand bank will focus on growing retail loans that are primarily housing and credit-card loans in the high-income segment, the analyst notes. However, the brokerage trims the stock's target price to THB187.00 from THB188.00 to reflect a lower 2025 book-value forecast. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
