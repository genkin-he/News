The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a \"band,\" around a central reference rate, or \"midpoint.\" It's currently at +/- 2%. </p><p class=\"\">How the process works:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Daily midpoint setting: Each morning, the PBOC sets a midpoint for the yuan against a basket of currencies, primarily the US dollar. The central bank takes into account factors such as market supply and demand, economic indicators, and international currency market fluctuations. The midpoint serves as a reference point for that day's trading.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">The trading band: The PBOC allows the yuan to move within a specified range around the midpoint. The trading band is set at +/- 2%, meaning the yuan could appreciate or depreciate by a maximum of 2% from the midpoint during a single trading day. This range is subject to change by the PBOC based on economic conditions and policy objectives.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Intervention: If the yuan's value approaches the limit of the trading band or experiences excessive volatility, the PBOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling the yuan to stabilize its value.

Volcon electric vehicles are the future of off-roading, not only because of their environmental benefits but also because of their near-silent operation, which allows for a more immersive outdoor experience.</p><p class=\"\">Volcon's vehicle roadmap includes both motorcycles and UTVs. Its first product, the innovative Grunt, began shipping to customers in late 2021 and combines a fat-tired physique with high-torque electric power and a near-silent drive train. The Volcon Grunt EVO, an evolution of the original Grunt with a belt drive, an improved suspension, and seat, began shipping to customers in October 2023. The Brat is Volcon's first foray into the wildly popular eBike market for both on-road and off-road riding and is currently being delivered to dealers across North America. In 2024, Volcon entered the rapidly expanding LUV and UTV market and shipped its first production MN1 unit in October 2024. The new MN1 and HF1 products empower the driver to explore the outdoors in a new and unique way that gas-powered units cannot. They offer the same thrilling performance of a standard LUV / UTV without the noise (or pollution), allowing the driver to explore the outdoors with all their senses.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Forward-Looking Statements</strong></p><p class=\"\">Some of the statements in this release are forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties.

Planters with greater upstream exposure in Indonesia should fare better due to better production, she reckons. Chye maintains her 2025-2026 CPO price assumptions at MYR4,000/ton and MYR3,800/ton, respectively, expecting elevated prices through 1Q amid weak output. Hong Leong maintains a neutral rating on Malaysian plantation sector as high CPO prices may not hold beyond 1Q. It has Johor Plantations, Hap Seng Plantations and IOI Corp. as its top picks.

Renesas Electronics is up 3.4% and Hitachi Ltd. is 2.9% higher. USD/JPY is at 154.31, compared with 155.37 as of Tuesday's Tokyo stock market close. Investors are closely watching U.S. trade talks as well as domestic earnings. Toyota Motor is scheduled to report its quarterly results later in the day.

There hasn't been any noticeable decrease in snacking consumption due to GLP-1 medications, either, Dirk Van de Put said. \"Since COVID, the indulgence part of snacking is growing just as fast as the healthy part,\" he said.

The famous doll posted declining gross billings--which measures sales to retailers before adjustments--throughout 2024. This was largely due to a comparison to 2023 figures, which were highly inflated due to the blockbuster \"Barbie\" movie, Kreiz says. This year, though, the doll will face easier year-over-year comparisons, he says. And the company plans to optimize demand creation, release new products and lean further into momentum with adult fans. Mattel shares rise 10% after the company guides for higher profit and revenue in 2025.

It thinks Ingenia Communities's earnings guidance could beat consensus hopes on stronger sales. Analyst Howard Penny tips Goodman to update its data center pipeline, driving growth expectations. \"Stronger than consensus expected sales growth, and positive spreads could support growth\" for mall owner Scentre, Citi says.

The U.S. has imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to respond. Macquarie highlights that 28% of Nufarm's earnings are from North America, and the company relies heavily on sourcing agricultural chemicals from China to sell into markets including the U.S. Nufarm's costs are likely to rise as the trade war unfolds. Still, Nufarm has some production in the U.S. and recently upgraded its manufacturing capacity in Australia so has \"some ability to self-source,\" says Macquarie. It retains a neutral call on Nufarm. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)</p><p class=\"\">1828 ET - Are China's 15% tariffs on U.S. coal meaningful for coal markets? That's the question posed by Morgan Stanley, which concludes any impact would be mostly be felt in metallurgical coal prices. Commodities strategist Helen Amos says China accounts for a relatively small share of U.S. coal exports. Still, U.S. exports of thermal and metallurgical coal to China increased over 2024. Morgan Stanley estimates tariffs would raise costs for around 3.4 million tons of thermal coal, representing less than 1% of traded volumes, and around 10.7 million tons of metallurgical coal, or some 3% of traded volumes. \"We see negligible or only modest potential price impact of China's coal import tariffs, given both coal markets are currently well supplied,\" Morgan Stanley says. \"But we watch for more meaningful shifts in met coal trade flows.\" (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)</p><p class=\"\">1818 ET - Risks to Macquarie's balance sheet from its investments in renewable energy look manageable to Morgan Stanley. Analyst Andrei Stadnik estimates some A$2 billion of Macquarie's principal investments, or 18%, are in green energy. Still, only 10% of investments by Corio--Macquarie's unit focused on offshore wind-energy developments--are in the U.S. and exposed to policy shifts by the Trump administration. \"Elsewhere, we estimate Macquarie booked a A$50 million gain on sale of Formosa 2 offshore wind in Asia, so offshore wind transactions are continuing,\" Morgan Stanley says. \"Nonetheless, we have baked in a A$150 million 2H impairment charge for principal investments in renewables.\" (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)</p><p class=\"\">1814 ET - California increased its minimum wages for fast-food workers last year, prompting restaurants to increase prices and hurt their sales in the process. Chipotle Mexican Grill said sales in its restaurants and across the industry remain depressed in the state as a result. Chipotle said it's holding off additional price increases for now beyond a nationwide 2% increase taken in December. (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)</p><p class=\"\">1724 ET - Brambles may disappoint some investors by deciding against upgrading its annual guidance at its first-half result announcement, according to its bull at UBS. Analyst Andre Fromyhr writes in a note that the stronger U.S. dollar makes Brambles' free cashflow guidance more challenging than when it was announced. Even so, he expects the global pallet giant to maintain guidance. Fromyhr reckons that Brambles needs to consistently deliver US$800 million annual free cashflow without strong price growth or dropping capex before the stock rerates further. UBS lifts its target price 18% to A$22.50 and keeps a buy rating on the stock, which is at A$19.26 ahead of the open. (stuart.condie@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
