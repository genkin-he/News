The shipbuilder's yards are full through 2027 with an order book of roughly US$24 billion, which is expected to lead to earnings CAGR of around 14% over the next two years, the analyst says. Revenue growth and margin expansion are drivers, as about 65% of the company's order book consists of containership orders that command higher value and margins, the analyst adds.

The 250 million ringgit acquisition comes as a surprise, particularly as many of the company's peers have adopted a cautious stance toward the region due to the impending European Union deforestation regulation policy, it notes. However, considering the plantation giant's strong supply-chain credentials, SD Guthrie views Europe as a key growth driver, MIDF says. SD Guthrie's balance sheet remains healthy and is well-positioned for expansion, it adds. MIDF maintains a buy rating on SD Guthrie and keeps its target price at MYR5.43.

Its own forecasts are for 8.4% growth. \"Harvey Norman also looks well positioned into results given the improvement in the Electrical and Furniture categories,\" Citi says.
