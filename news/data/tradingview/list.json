This is compounded by competition for user attention and the need to penetrate older demographics or developing markets, which may be more difficult and costly.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Advertising Revenue</strong>: The company generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, which is subject to fluctuations based on advertisers' perceptions of the effectiveness of its platform. Changes in data privacy regulations, such as those implemented by Apple and potentially by Google, have already impacted the company's ability to target and measure advertisements effectively, leading to reduced demand and pricing for advertising products.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Operational Dependencies</strong>: Operationally, the company relies heavily on Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services for its computing needs. Any disruption or unfavorable changes in terms by these providers could seriously harm operations.

The company is focusing on product innovation and diversification of revenue streams, such as subscription models, to mitigate these risks. However, the success of these initiatives is uncertain, and the company may face increased costs and regulatory scrutiny.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Market Risks</strong>: The company is exposed to market risks, including fluctuations in advertising demand and pricing, which are influenced by broader economic conditions and changes in data privacy regulations.

The company focuses on generating current income and capital appreciation.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Investment Strategy:</strong> The company invests mainly in first lien senior secured loans, second lien senior secured loans, subordinated debt, and preferred equity. It targets middle-market companies with annual EBITDA between $10 million and $250 million.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Market Position:</strong> As of December 31,Â 2024, Ares Capital was the largest publicly traded business development company (BDC) by market capitalization, with approximately $28.3 billion in total assets.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Geographical Performance:</strong> The company's investment portfolio is diversified across various regions, with significant investments in the West (25.2%), Midwest (20.9%), and Southeast (19.3%) regions of the United States.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Industry Focus:</strong> Ares Capital's portfolio is diversified across industries, with major investments in Software and Services (24.5%), Health Care Equipment and Services (12.0%), and Financial Services (9.9%).</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Operational Structure:</strong> The company is externally managed by Ares Capital Management LLC, leveraging the resources and relationships of Ares Management Corporation to identify and manage investment opportunities.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Competitive Advantages:</strong> Ares Capital benefits from the Ares platform, which provides extensive deal flow, investment evaluation, and due diligence capabilities, along with a seasoned investment team and broad origination strategy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Future Outlook:</strong> The company anticipates continued opportunities in the middle-market sector due to reduced competition from traditional banks and a large pool of un-invested private equity capital seeking debt financing.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Regulatory Structure:</strong> Ares Capital is regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act and has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (RIC) under the Internal Revenue Code, which influences its investment and operational strategies.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Strategic Initiatives</strong></p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Strategic Initiatives:</strong> The company has focused on strategic initiatives such as the establishment of the Senior Direct Lending Program (SDLP) in partnership with Varagon to provide first lien senior secured loans to U.S. middle-market companies. Additionally, the company completed two significant debt securitizations, ADL CLO 1 and ADL CLO 4, to enhance its capital structure and support its lending activities.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Capital Management:</strong> The company engaged in several capital management activities, including issuing and selling 65.2 million shares of common stock through 'at the market' offerings, generating net proceeds of $1.36 billion. It also repaid the 2024 Convertible Notes and the June 2024 Notes upon their maturity. The company maintained a stock repurchase program with $1.0 billion available for repurchases, although no shares were repurchased during the year. The company also managed its debt portfolio by maintaining various credit facilities and issuing new notes, resulting in a total debt outstanding of $13.8 billion as of December 31,Â 2024.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Future Outlook:</strong> The company plans to continue leveraging its strategic partnerships and securitization capabilities to support its lending activities. It aims to maintain a strong balance sheet by managing its debt levels and exploring opportunities for further equity offerings. The company also intends to utilize its stock repurchase program strategically, depending on market conditions and liquidity requirements.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Challenges and Risks</strong></p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Challenges and Risks:</strong> The company faces significant risks due to potential disruptions and instability in the capital markets, which could adversely affect its ability to raise debt and equity capital. Global economic, political, and market conditions, including geopolitical tensions and inflation, exacerbate these risks. The company's reliance on key personnel and systems from Ares, as well as its competitive market for investment opportunities, further compounds operational risks. Additionally, the company's investments in middle-market companies, which are often illiquid and highly leveraged, pose substantial risks, especially during economic downturns.</p><p class=\"\">The company is also exposed to regulatory risks, including maintaining its status as a Business Development Company (BDC) and a Regulated Investment Company (RIC). Failure to comply with these regulations could significantly impact its operational flexibility and tax obligations. Furthermore, the company must navigate complex regulations regarding transactions with affiliates, which could limit investment opportunities.</p><p class=\"\">Emerging risks include increased scrutiny and potential regulatory changes related to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) matters, which could impose additional costs and affect the company's reputation. The evolving landscape of artificial intelligence and its regulatory implications also present new challenges.</p><p class=\"\">Management acknowledges the challenges posed by the current macroeconomic environment, including labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, and interest rate volatility. The company is focused on managing these risks through strategic investment decisions and maintaining a diversified portfolio to mitigate potential losses.</p><p class=\"\">The company is subject to market risks, particularly interest rate fluctuations, which could impact its investment returns and net investment income. The use of leverage magnifies these risks, potentially leading to greater volatility in the company's financial performance. Additionally, the company faces risks related to the valuation of its investments, as most are not publicly traded and may be subject to significant unrealized depreciation during market downturns.</p><p class=\"\">SEC Filing: <a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1287750/000128775025000007/arcc-20241231.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ARES CAPITAL CORP [ ARCC ] - 10-K - Feb. 04, 2025</a></p></span></div>",

The basic weighted average shares outstanding for the three <br/>       months and year ended December 31,Â 2024 were approximately 655 million <br/>       and 624 million, respectively, and approximately 572 million and 554 <br/>       million, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2023. <br/> <br/>(2)    The basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the three <br/>       months and year ended December 31,Â 2024 was approximately 655 million <br/>       and 624 million shares, respectively. Ares Capital's diluted GAAP net <br/>       income per share for the three months and year ended December 31,Â 2023 <br/>       was $0.70 and $2.68, respectively. The weighted average shares <br/>       outstanding for the purpose of calculating the diluted GAAP net income <br/>       per share for the three months and year ended December 31,Â 2023 were <br/>       approximately 593 million shares and 575 million shares, respectively, <br/>       which includes approximately 21 million shares for each period related <br/>       to the assumed conversion of Ares Capital's then outstanding $403 <br/>       million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible notes <br/>       (the \"2024 Convertible Notes\"). <br/> <br/>(3)    Core EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure. Core EPS is the net increase <br/>       (decrease) in stockholders' equity resulting from operations, and <br/>       excludes net realized and unrealized gains and losses, any capital <br/>       gains incentive fee attributable to such net realized and unrealized <br/>       gains and losses and any income taxes related to such net realized <br/>       gains and losses, divided by the basic weighted average shares <br/>       outstanding for the relevant period. GAAP net income (loss) per share <br/>       is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Ares Capital <br/>       believes that Core EPS provides useful information to investors <br/>       regarding financial performance because it is one method Ares Capital <br/>       uses to measure its financial condition and results of operations. The <br/>       presentation of this additional information is not meant to be <br/>       considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial results <br/>       prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP net income, <br/>       the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Core EPS are <br/>       set forth in Schedule 1 hereto. <br/> <br/>(4)    Net income can vary substantially from period to period due to various <br/>       factors, including the level of new investment commitments, the <br/>       recognition of realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation <br/>       and depreciation. As a result, quarterly comparisons of net income may <br/>       not be meaningful. <br/> <br/>(5)    Computed as total principal debt outstanding less available cash <br/>       divided by stockholders' equity. Available cash excludes restricted <br/>       cash as well as cash held for uses specifically designated for paying <br/>       interest and expenses on certain debt. <br/> <br/> </pre><p class=\"\">\"With our fourth quarter's results, we concluded another successful year for the company where stable credit performance and a record year of investing supported strong earnings and further growth in book value per share,\" said Kipp deVeer, Chief Executive Officer of Ares Capital. \"As we enter 2025, we believe we are well positioned for what we expect will be an increasingly active investing market for acquisition finance and growth capital opportunities.\"</p><p class=\"\">\"Through year-end 2024, we have now paid over 15 consecutive years of stable or growing regular dividends while continuing to increase our book value for shareholders,\" said Scott Lem, Chief Financial Officer of Ares Capital. \"Our ability to deliver this attractive level of long-term performance is supported by the strength of our balance sheet, which we believe is a key point of differentiation for ARCC.\"</p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"> <br/>PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY <br/> <br/>(dollar amounts in <br/>millions)               Q4-24   Q4-23      FY-24        FY-23 <br/>---------------------   ------  ------  -----------  ----------- <br/>Portfolio Activity <br/>During the Period: <br/>    Gross commitments   $3,751  $2,384  $15,081      $ 5,966 <br/>    Exits of <br/>     commitments        $2,715  $1,427  $10,103      $ 5,729 <br/> <br/>Portfolio <br/>Information: <br/>                                           As of December 31, <br/>                                        ------------------------ <br/>                                           2024         2023 <br/>                                        -----------  ----------- <br/>    Portfolio <br/>     investments at <br/>     fair value                         $26,720      $22,874 <br/>    Fair value of <br/>     accruing debt and <br/>     other income <br/>     producing <br/>     securities(6)                      $23,643      $20,375 <br/>    Number of <br/>     portfolio company <br/>     investments                            550          505 <br/>    Percentage of <br/>     floating rate <br/>     securities at <br/>     fair value(7)                           69%          69% <br/>    Weighted average <br/>    yields on debt <br/>    and other income <br/>    producing <br/>    securities(8): <br/>        At amortized <br/>         cost                              11.1%        12.5% <br/>        At fair value                      11.2%        12.5% <br/>    Weighted average <br/>    yields on total <br/>    investments(9): <br/>        At amortized <br/>         cost                              10.0%        11.3% <br/>        At fair value                       9.9%        11.2% <br/> <br/>    Asset class <br/>    percentage at <br/>    fair value: <br/>        First lien <br/>         senior <br/>         secured <br/>         loans                               57%          44% <br/>        Second lien <br/>         senior <br/>         secured <br/>         loans                                7%          16% <br/>        Subordinated <br/>         certificates <br/>         of the SDLP                          5%           6% <br/>        Senior <br/>         subordinated <br/>         loans                                5%           5% <br/>        Preferred <br/>         equity                              10%          11% <br/>        Ivy Hill Asset <br/>         Management, <br/>         L.P.(10)                             7%           9% <br/>        Other equity                          9%           9% <br/> <br/> <br/>____________________________ <br/>(6)     Includes the fair value of Ares Capital's equity investment in Ivy <br/>        Hill Asset Management, L.P.

<br/>(1)    All per share amounts and weighted average shares outstanding are <br/>       basic. The basic weighted average shares outstanding for the three <br/>       months and year ended December 31,Â 2024 were approximately 655 million <br/>       and 624 million, respectively, and approximately 572 million and 554 <br/>       million, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2023. <br/> <br/>(2)    The basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the three <br/>       months and year ended December 31,Â 2024 were approximately 655 million <br/>       shares and 624 million shares, respectively. Ares Capital's diluted <br/>       GAAP net income per share for the three months and year ended December <br/>       31,Â 2023 was $0.70 and $2.68, respectively. The weighted average shares <br/>       outstanding for the purpose of calculating the diluted GAAP net income <br/>       per share for the three months and year ended December 31,Â 2023 were <br/>       approximately 593 million shares and 575 million shares, respectively, <br/>       which includes approximately 21 million shares for each period related <br/>       to the assumed conversion of the then outstanding 2024 Convertible <br/>       Notes. <br/> <br/>(3)    Core EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure. Core EPS is the net increase <br/>       (decrease) in stockholders' equity resulting from operations, and <br/>       excludes net realized and unrealized gains and losses, any capital <br/>       gains incentive fee attributable to such net realized and unrealized <br/>       gains and losses and any income taxes related to such net realized <br/>       gains and losses, divided by the basic weighted average shares <br/>       outstanding for the relevant period. GAAP net income (loss) per share <br/>       is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Ares Capital <br/>       believes that Core EPS provides useful information to investors <br/>       regarding financial performance because it is one method Ares Capital <br/>       uses to measure its financial condition and results of operations. The <br/>       presentation of this additional information is not meant to be <br/>       considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial results <br/>       prepared in accordance with GAAP. <br/> </pre><p class=\"\">View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250205975995/en/</p><p class=\"\">CONTACT:    INVESTOR RELATIONS CONTACTS</p><p class=\"\">Ares Capital Corporation</p><p class=\"\">John Stilmar or Carl Drake</p><p class=\"\">(888) 818-5298</p><p class=\"\">irarcc@aresmgmt.com</p></span></div>",
