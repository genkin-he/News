But that selling was short-lived, with soybeans and other grains turning positive through Tuesday's trading. Traders who have spoken to The Wall Street Journal say that a lot of market activity has become reactive to new headlines, but is showing restraint in light of trade uncertainty. \"I think the trade is well braced for this,\" said Terry Reilly of Marex.</p><p class=\"\">INSIGHT</p><p class=\"\">Purchasing Implications: China's retaliatory tariffs made no mention of raw soybeans, but traders are wondering nonetheless about whether China will curb its purchases. \"Remember, we are looking to see if there is any new commodity buying by China, versus just 'maneuvering to avoid tariffs,'\" said Naomi Blohm of Total Farm Marketing in a note.</p><p class=\"\">Looking on the Bright Side: U.S. farmers carried an optimistic outlook into 2025, according to the latest Ag Economy Barometer published by Purdue University and the CME Group. Surveyed farmers said that their view of current conditions of the agricultural economy have improved, buoyed by a month of gains for row crop prices on the CBOT. Farmers are increasingly expecting to have a \"more robust\" year financially than last year--although some concerns remain. Some 42% of surveyed farmers identified trade policy as their top policy concern over the next five years, although the share of farmers thinking that a trade war is unlikely grew in January.</p><p class=\"\">Tough Times: Grain merchant ADM said, as part of its plan to cut costs, it could shutter or divest facilities that are in need of repair, have a history of poor performance or are located in areas with excess capacity. CEO Juan Luciano said on a call with investors that the company has identified about $2 billion worth of opportunities. The company is facing pressure from low crop prices and falling profit margins in its oilseed-processing business. \"We will execute on this over time,\" Luciano said.</p><p class=\"\">AHEAD</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">The EIA will release its weekly ethanol production and stocks report at 10:30 a.m. ET Wednesday.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Corteva will release its fourth-quarter earnings report after the market closes on Wednesday.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">The USDA will release its weekly export sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Thursday.</li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Patrick Thomas contributed to this article.</li></ul><p class=\"\">Write to Kirk Maltais at kirk.maltais@wsj.com</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Luis Garcia and Rob Curran</p><p class=\"\">Apollo Global Management invested a firm record of $222 billion last year as the credit specialist sees increased opportunities to finance infrastructure developers in what it calls a \"global industrial renaissance.\"</p><p class=\"\">\"We are quite focused on increasing our capacity to originate\" new investments, Chief Executive Marc Rowan said Tuesday during a call with analysts to discuss the New York-based firm's results during last year's fourth quarter. \"That's what we intend to do.\"</p><p class=\"\">Rowan was referring partly to Apollo's agreed-to acquisition of Argo Infrastructure Partners, a fund manager with about $6 billion in assets across industries such as digital infrastructure, renewable energy and transportation. The deal, unveiled last month, is part of Apollo's effort to expand its investments in assets and businesses across various fast-growing industries.</p><p class=\"\">\"This is not just about [artificial intelligence] and DeepSeek,\" Rowan said. \"This is about fundamental investments in energy, in infrastructure, in power, in data, in next-generation manufacturing and a host of other things that are going to be needed [and] financed.\"</p><p class=\"\">Rowan added that projects in those industries are typically \"long dated and complex,\" making them less suitable for traditional bank financing and creating opportunities for private-credit firms.</p><p class=\"\">Apollo's record origination, a metric that reflects new investments, last year was more than double the $97 billion invested in 2023, according to a presentation of the results. Apollo originated $61 billion during last year's fourth quarter alone, its second highest quarterly total to date, according to Rowan.</p><p class=\"\">The firm's funds brought in $152 billion in fresh capital last year, slightly less than $157 billion in 2023. That helped lift its total assets under management by about 15%, to $751 billion at the end of December, $616 billion of which in credit strategies, the presentation showed.</p><p class=\"\">Apollo's asset management business accounted for about $81 billion of last year's capital inflows, while the firm's insurer Athene represented $71 billion, James Zelter, Apollo's president, said during Tuesday's earnings call.</p><p class=\"\">\"In short, both sides of the house produced.\" Zelter said. \"Alongside origination, capital formation is the lifeblood of our continued growth.\"</p><p class=\"\">Apollo  recently promoted Zelter to president of the holding company that also includes Athene, while former head of credit John Zito took his place as co-president of the firm's asset-management arm alongside Scott Kleinman. The promotions have been seen as an effort to clarify possible successors to Rowan.</p><p class=\"\">Apollo plans to expand its investments across strategies such as asset-backed financing and direct lending, including to large businesses whose capital needs are too</p><p class=\"\">big to be met in public-debt markets alone, Zelter said. As examples, he cited the joint venture that Apollo formed last year with chip maker Intel, which involved an $11 billion investment, and the $700 million financing it led for music company Sony Music Group.</p><p class=\"\">Zelter added that Apollo is also looking to back companies that private-equity firms are having difficulty selling or otherwise exiting through an initial public offering.</p><p class=\"\">\"When you think about the overhang from PE sponsors, when you think about the other challenges right now in monetization of the IPO market, certainly I think you're going to see a much, much greater volume of opportunity in the U.S. and in Europe and parts of Asia,\" he said.</p><p class=\"\">Apollo posted earnings of $1.49 billion, or $2.39 a share, down from $2.76 billion, or $4.44 a share, a year earlier.</p><p class=\"\">On an adjusted basis, Apollo posted earnings of $1.36 billion, or $2.22 a share, a quarterly record, beating the average analyst peg of $1.85 a share, as per FactSet.</p><p class=\"\">Apollo declared a dividend of 46.25 cents a per share, payable Feb. 28 to holders of record at the close of business on Feb. 18.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Luis Garcia at luis.garcia@wsj.com and Rob Curran at rob.curran@wsj.com</p></span></div>",
