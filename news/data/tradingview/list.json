(RAD), a subsidiary of Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions, Inc. (the “Company”) (OTCPK:AITX), continues to expand its presence within the State, Local, and Education (SLED) market sector, securing new deployments of its autonomous security solutions. Organizations across these sectors are turning to RAD’s innovative technology to enhance public safety, reduce security costs, and provide proactive deterrence against crime. The Company has successfully placed RIO™ and ROSA™ devices in a range of environments, including municipal spaces, educational institutions, and high-traffic public districts, with additional deployments expected in the near future.</p><p class=\"\">As part of its expanding footprint, RAD recently received an order for four ROSA units set to be deployed in a busy urban waterfront district in a major Midwestern city. These security devices will provide AI driven autonomous proactive deterrence in addition to incident detection, and continuous surveillance, deterrence in a high-traffic area frequented by residents, businesses, and visitors. The deployment reflects the growing demand among public sector organizations and improvement districts for AI-powered security solutions that enhance safety while optimizing operational efficiency.</p><p class=\"\">Recent data indicates that local governments are prioritizing public safety and security in their budgets. In 2023, cities increased their spending by an average of 6.7% compared to 2022, with a significant portion allocated to public safety initiatives1. Looking ahead, experts anticipate that local governments will continue to elevate their investment in public safety technologies2. This trend includes the adoption of artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies aimed at enhancing security and efficiency.</p><p class=\"\">“This latest order is another indicator that cities and counties are embracing autonomous security as a vital component of their safety strategies,” said Troy McCanna, Chief Security Officer of RAD. “The positive reception we’ve seen in cities across the country reinforces the effectiveness of our solutions and the growing demand for cost-effective, responsive security technology.”</p><p class=\"\">Utilized by the popular solar-powered RIO trailers, these ROSA units will be mounted on existing light poles, utilizing a continuous 24/7 power source. This installation method ensures uninterrupted operation, making ROSA an ideal solution for urban districts requiring persistent security coverage without reliance on solar charging or a large footprint.</p><p class=\"\">“As communities continue evaluating innovative security solutions, many are also exploring RAD’s SARA™ (Speaking Autonomous Responsive Agent) technology,” concluded McCanna. “By incorporating SARA, the clients have the potential to further reduce costs while enhancing community engagement and overall security effectiveness.” With additional orders expected soon, RAD is positioning itself as the go-to provider for cities, counties and states looking to enhance safety while maintaining operational efficiency.</p><p class=\"\">ROSA is a multiple award-winning, compact, self-contained security and communication device that can be installed and activated in about 15 minutes. Its AI-driven capabilities include human, firearm, and vehicle detection, license plate recognition, responsive digital signage, audio messaging, and seamless integration with RAD’s software suite for real-time notifications and autonomous intelligent responses. Two-way communication is optimized for cellular, including live video from ROSA’s high-resolution, full-color, always-on cameras. RAD has published six Case Studies detailing how ROSA has helped eliminate instances of theft, trespassing and loitering at retail centers, hospital campuses, multi-family communities, car rental locations and construction sites across the country.</p><p class=\"\">AITX, through its primary subsidiary, Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc. (RAD), is redefining the nearly $50 billion (US) security and guarding services industry3 through its broad lineup of innovative, AI-driven Solutions-as-a-Service business model. RAD solutions are specifically designed to provide cost savings to businesses of between 35%-80% when compared to the industry’s existing and costly manned security guarding and monitoring model. RAD delivers these tremendous cost savings via a suite of stationary and mobile robotic solutions that complement, and at times, directly replace the need for human personnel in environments better suited for machines. All RAD technologies, AI-based analytics and software platforms are developed in-house. </p><p class=\"\">RAD has a prospective sales pipeline of over 35 Fortune 500 companies and numerous other client opportunities. RAD expects to continue to attract new business as it converts its existing sales opportunities into deployed clients generating a recurring revenue stream. Each Fortune 500 client has the potential of making numerous reorders over time.</p><p class=\"\">AITX is an innovator in the delivery of artificial intelligence-based solutions that empower organizations to gain new insight, solve complex challenges and fuel new business ideas.

Dell’s latest line-up of AI notebooks includes Neural Processor Units (NPUs), which are dedicated AI engines, to manage sustained AI and AI offload. This builds on Dell’s portfolio as the broadest GaN adapter offering for notebooks in the industry.</p><p class=\"\">The new adapters will also help Dell achieve its advanced sustainability goals, with a focus on CO2 reduction and energy reduction. The adapter cases require up to 50% less plastic and are made with post-recycled materials, significantly reducing energy waste, and improving resource utilization. Navitas’ GaNFast and GeneSiC technologies increase the level of system integration and switching frequency, which reduces the number of components, as well as the size, resulting in a ‘dematerialization’ that lowers carbon footprint throughout the production, packaging, and logistics processes. Each GaNFast power IC shipped saves 4 kg CO2 and every SiC MOSFET shipped saves 25 kg CO2 vs. legacy silicon power chips.</p><p class=\"\">“Since Dell’s first GaN adapter was enabled by Navitas back in 2020, we’ve worked closely with Dell engineering to further improve charging speed, efficiency, size, weight, and now environmental footprint,” said Gene Sheridan, CEO and co-founder of Navitas. “Dell’s new adapters are an optimal solution for speed, portability, and sustainability. Our clients achieve a win-win for both the market and environment by deploying Navitas GaNFast power ICs and GeneSiC power devices.”</p><p class=\"\">For more information on our GaNFast portfolio and charging system solutions, please contact info@navitassemi.com or visit www.navitassemi.com.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Navitas</strong></p><p class=\"\">Navitas Semiconductor  is the only pure-play, next-generation power-semiconductor company, celebrating 10 years of power innovation founded in 2014. GaNFast power ICs integrate gallium nitride (GaN) power and drive, with control, sensing, and protection to enable faster charging, higher power density, and greater energy savings.

It is the number one ordered PSMA PET imaging agent in the U.S., and is a proven diagnostic backed by real-world experience, including in over 400,000 scans across 48 states.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">PYLARIFY</strong><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">®</strong> <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">(piflufolastat F 18) Injection</strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Indication</strong></p><p class=\"\">PYLARIFY® (piflufolastat F 18) Injection is a radioactive diagnostic agent indicated for positron emission tomography (PET) of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positive lesions in men with prostate cancer:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">with suspected metastasis who are candidates for initial definitive therapy.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">with suspected recurrence based on elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level.</li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Important Safety Information</strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Contraindications</strong></p><p class=\"\">None.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Warnings and Precautions</strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Risk of Image Misinterpretation</strong></p><p class=\"\">Imaging interpretation errors can occur with PYLARIFY imaging. A negative image does not rule out the presence of prostate cancer and a positive image does not confirm the presence of prostate cancer. The performance of PYLARIFY for imaging of patients with biochemical evidence of recurrence of prostate cancer seems to be affected by serum PSA levels. The performance of PYLARIFY for imaging of metastatic pelvic lymph nodes prior to initial definitive therapy seems to be affected by risk factors such as Gleason score and tumor stage. PYLARIFY uptake is not specific for prostate cancer and may occur with other types of cancer as well as non-malignant processes and in normal tissues. Clinical correlation, which may include histopathological evaluation of the suspected prostate cancer site, is recommended.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Hypersensitivity Reactions</strong></p><p class=\"\">Monitor patients for hypersensitivity reactions, particularly patients with a history of allergy to other drugs and foods. Reactions may be delayed. Always have trained staff and resuscitation equipment available.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Radiation Risks</strong></p><p class=\"\">Diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, including PYLARIFY, expose patients to radiation. Radiation exposure is associated with a dose-dependent increased risk of cancer. Ensure safe handling and preparation procedures to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure. Advise patients to hydrate before and after administration and to void frequently after administration.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Adverse Reactions</strong></p><p class=\"\">The most frequently reported adverse reactions were headaches, dysgeusia and fatigue, occurring at rate of ≤2% during clinical studies with PYLARIFY. In addition, a delayed hypersensitivity reaction was reported in one patient (0.2%) with a history of allergic reactions.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Drug interactions</strong></p><p class=\"\">Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and other therapies targeting the androgen pathway, such as androgen receptor antagonists, may result in changes in uptake of PYLARIFY in prostate cancer. The effect of these therapies on performance of PYLARIFY PET has not been established.</p><p class=\"\">To report suspected adverse reactions for PYLARIFY, call 1-800-362-2668 or contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.</p><p class=\"\">Please read the accompanying full Prescribing Information also available at PYLARIFY.com.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Lantheus </strong></p><p class=\"\">Lantheus is the leading radiopharmaceutical-focused company, delivering life-changing science to enable clinicians to Find, Fight and Follow disease to deliver better patient outcomes.
