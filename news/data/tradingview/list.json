KA will seek fullcompensation for increased customs tariffs from its customers to recover anyadditional costs imposed by these tariffs, similar to what others in theindustry will do. The impact of new tariffs will be limited also with lessthanfull customer compensation.President of the United States (US) Donald Trump signed executive orders onFeb1, 2025, to implement 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods, whileimposinga 10% duty on Chinese goods. On February 3, 2025, President Trump agreed toholdoff imposing tariffs on Mexico and Canada for 30 days, while the plan to levytariffs on China came into effect on February 4, 2025.</p><p class=\"\">\"It is important to note that it is not a challenge that KA is facing alone,itis a global vehicle and automotive industry challenge. KA has the ambition tofully recover any additional cost related to the imposed tariffs-passing thecost on to our customers ultimately means that the vehicles will be moreexpensive. We see a risk that higher vehicle prices will lower the overallmarket demand, which then would impact negatively on KA's orderbooks,\" saysKA'sinterim President &amp; CEO and CFO Christian Johansson.KA has two manufacturing plants in Mexico: In Ramos Arizpe for the FlowControlSystems product range and in Nuevo Laredo, for the Drive Control Systems andDriveline product range. KA's customers are primarily commercial vehicle andpassenger car manufacturers, or Tier 1 suppliers to the automotive industry.Products are shipped to customer production sites in the US and in Mexico. KAhas three manufacturing sites in the US, selling primarily to US-basedcustomers. In Canada, KA has a smaller manufacturing plant supplying toprimarily a local Canadian customer.Based on the information available to date, all material and componentssourcedby KA from China to KA's US plants are subject to increased tariffs. Inaddition, materials delivered to KA plants in the US by US suppliers havingsub-supplies from China are on that portion subject to increased customs tariffs.The customs tariffs increase is estimated to be approximately MEUR 2 for thefull year 2025, based on present purchasing volumes.Potential tariffs for exports from Mexico to the US will have to be assessedwhen the regulations for how this will be implemented will be fully known andifthese tariffs will be imposed. Based on present information, the company'sassessment is that the negative effect would be fairly limited since thematerial and components under temporary import to Mexico from the US areexempted.KA is continuously preparing to be able to act quickly if increased tariffs onMexican and Canadian goods take effect after the 30-day postponement.</p><p class=\"\">KA believes in the importance of local presence in North America and continuesto have ambitions to increase sourcing locally in the region. As a company, KAis continuously considering its supplier base footprint based on total landedcost. Tariffs are one important existing parameter in the sourcing processtoday.

The city's retail sales by value fell 7.3% in 2024.The easing of visa policies for mainland Chinese visitors to Hong Kong and continued increase in foreign tourists have boosted Hong Kong's visitor numbers, they add. The opening of Kai Tak Sports Park in March and multiple major events including concerts and sporting events should also attract high-spending tourists in 2025 and encourage local consumption, they say. There were encouraging signs in higher visitor numbers from China and other countries over the Lunar New Year holiday, which have boosted hotel bookings and luxury spending, CGS International says. (jiahui.huang@wsj.com; @ivy_jiahuihuang)</p><p class=\"\">0439 GMT - Japan's cash earnings jumped in December, while Moody's Analytics' Stefan Angrick sees little evidence of sustained real wage growth. At first glance, the data suggests things are turning around as monthly cash earnings rose solidly, the economist says, adding that the devil is in the details. Though nominal pay growth is picking up, the gains are uneven, and real cash earnings climbed only 0.6% on year, he says, describing it \"a far more modest gain than the glossy nominal figure.\" The pay bump was also driven significantly by temporary factors, such as bonuses. Wage growth is likely to improve despite strong headwinds expected in 2025, including, but not limited to, a potential inflation spike, he adds. Much depends on the spring wage negotiations. If pay gains come in below 5%, that could delay the rate hikes, he adds.

The headline S&amp;P Global PMI for January signaled only a modest improvement in business conditions and slipped to its lowest since September 2024. Weak external demand was the main growth constraint, says Tim Moore, economics director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. \"Survey respondents noted subdued willingness to spend among clients amid concerns about the near-term global economic outlook, in particular the impact of potential U.S. tariffs.\" Export sales fell at the fastest pace since September 2024, while new business from Mainland China decreased to the greatest extent since April 2022.

Headline inflation accelerated to 2.2% from 1.9% in December, but the BOK may focus on soft core inflation and weak domestic demand, Son says. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, ticked up to 1.9% from 1.8% in December. BOK policymakers see forex-related pressures as limited and oil prices as a one-off shock, he notes. \"As such, we believe inflation is unlikely to stop the BOK from cutting rates 25bp at its February meeting,\" he says. (kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0338 GMT - The Philippines' higher-than-expected January inflation print has cleared the way for a rate cut from the BSP next week, Barclays economist Shreya Sodhani says in a note. Although headline CPI rose 2.9% on year, it remained at the midpoint of BSP's 2.5%-3.3% forecast range, she writes. Inflation was driven by food prices, which usually rise in January, she says. The latest inflation print and slower-than-expected 4Q GDP growth suggest that a rate cut is the most likely outcome, she adds. However, there are risks that the BSP could delay rate cuts, as officials have suggested that the central bank may ease only once in 1H and another time in 2H, she says. Barclays continues to expect three rate cuts this year. (amanda.lee@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0323 GMT - China's target measures unveiled on Tuesday leave room for potential talks with the U.S., say two economists at BofA Global Research in a research report. \"These announcements mark a measured and comprehensive retaliation that seeks to target U.S. business interests, while minimizing the impact on China's economy,\" the economists say. China seems to be carefully targeting energy products which the country has the potential to purchase more of, they say. \"In potential negotiations in the future, reaching a deal where China pledges to buy more oil and gas from the U.S. may be more desirable than China reducing such imports on higher tariffs,\" the economists add. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0314 GMT - The U.S. Treasury 10-year yield still faces downside risk, based on daily charts, says Quek Ser Leang of UOB's Global Economics &amp; Markets Research in a research report. There's a possibility the 10-year yield will fall into the daily Ichimoku cloud, which is currently between 4.318% and 4.447%, the markets strategist says. Going forward, a break of the 10-year yield below the bottom of the daily Ichimoku cloud might potentially trigger sharp declines, the strategist says. On the other hand, if the 10-year yield rises above 4.690%, this would suggest that the 10-year yield is likely to trade in a range, the strategist adds. Treasury 10-year yield is steady at 4.5167%. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0257 GMT - Stronger-than-expected labor cash earnings growth in Japan and an expansionary services PMI reading continues to support BOJ policy normalization, ING's Min Joo Kang says. Data released earlier showed solid on-year labor cash earnings growth in December, with base earnings rising steadily for a second month, while January's services PMI marked its highest level since September 2024. \"Strong wage growth is likely to lead to consumption growth and keep inflation above 2%,\" the economist says. The market is pricing in another BOJ rate hike in July, but ING forecasts a move in May is possible, especially if this year's Shunto wage talk results are as strong as last year's. ING now sees BOJ's terminal rate at 1.25% versus 1.0% previously, tipping hikes in May and October of 2025, followed by another in 2026. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0254 GMT - The future path of the U.S.-China trade conflict remains highly uncertain, say Goldman Sachs analysts in a note. China's retaliatory tariffs appear much less than proportional compared to the U.S.'s 10% across-the-board additional tariff on $525 billion worth of Chinese goods, they write. However, the combination of retaliatory tariffs with export bans, entity list additions, and antitrust probe into Google, suggests a \"more coordinated and comprehensive approach by [Chinese] policymakers\" than during the 2018-2019 U.S.-China trade war, they say. In the coming days, the U.S.'s reactions to China's retaliation will be among key events to watch, they add. (amanda.lee@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0230 GMT - Unemployment in New Zealand is still rising despite rapid interest-rate cuts since mid-2024, leaving consumers and business owners still searching to see the light of an economic recovery. Mark Smith, senior economist at ASB Bank expects demand for labor will continue to weaken until a modest economic recovery finally shows up in the second half of 2025. Firms will have to carefully manage employee headcount in that time, he adds. With inflation close to the target midpoint and monetary settings still slowing the economy, further swift monetary easing looks appropriate to limit economic and labor market scarring, he adds.

The city's retail sales by value fell 7.3% in 2024.The easing of visa policies for mainland Chinese visitors to Hong Kong and continued increase in foreign tourists have boosted Hong Kong's visitor numbers, they add. The opening of Kai Tak Sports Park in March and multiple major events including concerts and sporting events should also attract high-spending tourists in 2025 and encourage local consumption, they say. There were encouraging signs in higher visitor numbers from China and other countries over the Lunar New Year holiday, which have boosted hotel bookings and luxury spending, CGS International says.
