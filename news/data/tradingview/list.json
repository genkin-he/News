Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing Veralto Corporation's (\"Veralto\" or the \"Company\") results that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure, help our investors:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">with respect to the profitability-related non-GAAP measures, understand   the long-term profitability trends of our business and compare our   profitability to prior and future periods and to our peers;   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">with respect to core sales and related sales measures, identify   underlying growth trends in our business and compare our sales   performance with prior and future periods and to our peers; and   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">with respect to free cash flow and related cash flow measures (the \"FCF   Measure\"), understand Veralto's ability to generate cash without external   financings, strengthen its balance sheet, invest in its business and grow   its business through acquisitions and other strategic opportunities   (although a limitation of free cash flow is that it does not take into   account the Company's non-discretionary expenditures, and as a result the   entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for   discretionary expenditures). </li></ul><p class=\"\">Management uses these non-GAAP measures to measure the Company's operating and financial performance.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures set forth above have been   excluded for the following reasons:   <br/> -- Amortization of Intangible Assets:  We exclude the amortization of <br/> acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and   timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing,   size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While   we have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not   acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an   acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and   related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can   vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of   this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons   of operating results over time between our newly acquired and   long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and   non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe however that it is   important for investors to understand that such intangible assets   contribute to sales generation and that intangible asset   amortization related to past acquisitions will recur in future   periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized.   <br/> -- Restructuring Charges:  We exclude costs incurred pursuant to <br/> discrete restructuring plans that are fundamentally different (in   terms of the size, strategic nature and planning requirements, as   well as the inconsistent frequency, of such plans) from the   ongoing productivity improvements that result from application of   the Veralto Enterprise System. Because these restructuring plans   are incremental to the core activities that arise in the ordinary   course of our business and we believe are not indicative of   Veralto's ongoing operating costs in a given period, we exclude   these costs to facilitate a more consistent comparison of   operating results over time.   <br/> -- Other Adjustments:  With respect to the other items excluded from <br/> the profitability-related non-GAAP measures, we exclude these   items because they are of a nature and/or size that occur with   inconsistent frequency, occur for reasons that may be unrelated to   Veralto's commercial performance during the period and/or we   believe that such items may obscure underlying business trends and   make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.   <br/> -- Standalone Adjustments:  We believe these adjustments provide <br/> additional insight into how our businesses are performing, on a   normalized basis. However, these non-GAAP financial measures   should not be construed as inferring that our future results will   be unaffected by the items for which the measure adjusts. </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">With respect to core operating profit margin changes, in addition to the   explanation set forth in the bullets above relating to \"restructuring   charges\" and \"other adjustments\", we exclude the impact of businesses   owned for less than one year (or disposed of during such period and not   treated as discontinued operations) because the timing, size, number and   nature of such transactions can vary significantly from period to period   and may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of   long-term performance difficult.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">With respect to core sales related measures, (1) we exclude the impact of   currency translation because it is not under management's control, is   subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and (2)   we exclude the effect of acquisitions and divested product lines because   the timing, size, number and nature of such transactions can vary   significantly from period-to-period and between us and our peers, which   we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of   long-term performance difficult.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">With respect to the FCF Measure, we exclude payments for additions to   property, plant and equipment (net of the proceeds from capital   disposals) to demonstrate the amount of operating cash flow for the   period that remains after accounting for the Company's capital   expenditure requirements. </li></ul><p class=\"\">View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/veralto-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results-302367881.html</p><p class=\"\">SOURCE Veralto</p><p class=\"\">/CONTACT: Investor Relations Contact: Ryan Taylor, Vice President, Investor Relations, investors@veralto.com; Media Relations Contact: Steve Field, Vice President, Communications, steve.field@veralto.com</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Anita Hamilton</p><p class=\"\">As a Feb. 6 deadline nears for federal employees to resign voluntarily with a soft exit, the Trump administration is tightening the screws in an effort to get firmer commitments from employees weighing the offer.</p><p class=\"\">The initial email from the Office of Personnel Management that landed in workers' inboxes on Jan. 28 sounded almost too good to be true. Anyone who resigned by email was offered full pay through the end of September without ever having to set foot back in the office. \"It really is a fair &amp; generous offer,\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who is heading up President Donald Trump's sweeping cost-cutting efforts, posted on X the following day.</p><p class=\"\">But it turns out that accepting the offer isn't quite as simple as typing \"Resign\" in a subject line, then hitting send. A template form for deferred-resignation agreements distributed to federal agencies this week requires employees to agree to new, more restrictive terms.</p><p class=\"\">The biggest caveat is that while those accepting the offer are bound by it, the government is free to revoke it. A new OPM memo released Tuesday afternoon confirms this loophole, adding \"Were the government to backtrack on its commitments, an employee would be entitled to request a rescission of his or her resignation.\" It doesn't state whether such a request would be honored.</p><p class=\"\">Secondly, workers are still on the hook to keep working through the end of February before being placed on administrative leave. The Tuesday memo reiterated that ethical standards prohibiting outside employment might still apply through Sept. 30, but noted that \"by minimizing an employee's job duties and limiting the number of matters in which he or she is involved, administrative leave reduces the potential for conflicts with any outside employment.\"</p><p class=\"\">Lastly, the template agreement acknowledges the elephant in the room that many critics of the plan have pointed out: the government can't guarantee payment through the end of the fiscal year in September because it is only funded through March 14. If no funding deal is reached by then and the government shuts down, employees will be placed on furlough and then receive back pay once funding resumes.</p><p class=\"\">Trump senior advisor Stephen Miller said on Friday that a \"large number\" of workers had already accepted the deal. The OPM declined Barron's request for hard numbers, saying they don't plan to share that information until after the Feb. 6 deadline.</p><p class=\"\">As the clock ticks on the deferred-resignation offer, the government is also making things more uncomfortable for the more than one million federal civilian workers who currently either telework or have fully remote positions.</p><p class=\"\">A Friday night memo to agency heads from the president sought to invalidate any collective-bargaining agreements that were executed in the last 30 days of the Biden administration. Because pre-existing remote work agreements were extended in new contracts for Education Department employees, for example, they might lose that perk. A Monday follow-up memo from OPM provides additional guidance on potentially revoking or renegotiating all existing telework arrangements.</p><p class=\"\">It's unclear whether the administration can enforce such a policy, however, according to legal experts. In invoking a 2010 case decided by the Supreme Court to justify revoking agreements finalized shortly before taking office, \"this policy like several others if effectuated will likely find itself determined by the courts as to its lawfulness,\" George Washington University law professor Aram Gavoor told Barron's. \"The courts have the final say,\" he added.</p><p class=\"\">It may have more leverage renegotiating telework arrangements. \"The Administration can certainly direct agencies to revise those telework plans, and for some agencies conditions might justify a substantial reduction,\" said Georgetown Law professor David Super.</p><p class=\"\">Federal law actually requires agencies to have telework plans, he adds. \"But that statute, like those on rescissions, federal worker buy-outs, and collective bargaining, requires consideration of the particular circumstances of individual agencies.\"</p><p class=\"\">Several unions representing federal workers, lawmakers including Virginia Democrat Sen. Tim Kaine, and Democratic Attorneys General from 12 states have all urged workers to either reject or use caution when weighing the offers. \"These supposed offers are not guaranteed,\" said New York Attorney General Letitia James.</p><p class=\"\">\"Union contracts are enforceable by law, and the president doesn't have the authority to make unilateral changes to those agreements,\" union leader and president of the American Federation of Government Employees, Everett Kelley, said. \"AFGE members will not be intimidated. If our contracts are violated, we will aggressively defend them.\"</p><p class=\"\">But the abrupt firings or placement on administrative leave of workers in agencies including the Justice Department, Education Department, and U.S. Agency for International Development present a bleak alternative to those who don't take the offer and attempt to resist the new administration's policies.</p><p class=\"\">Such fears may explain why the government is expecting a spike in last-minute resignations in the final hours before the Thursday deadline.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Anita Hamilton at anita.hamilton@barrons.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

What's more, China didn't raise tariffs on strategic goods such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.</p><p class=\"\">In a move that wasn't explicitly tied to Trump's tariffs, China also said it was starting an antitrust probe into Alphabet's Google, the internet search engine.</p><p class=\"\">Beijing added two U.S. companies to its unreliable entity list — Calvin Klein owner PVH, and biotechnology company Illumina.</p><p class=\"\">\"The two entities have violated normal market-trading principles, terminated regular trade with Chinese companies, and adopted discriminatory measures against Chinese companies,\" state-owned news agency Xinhua reported, citing a statement from the Commerce Ministry.</p><p class=\"\">The ministry said the list only targets the very few foreign entities that undermine China's national security. It means measures could be taken against the companies.</p><p class=\"\">PVH told Barron's the company is \"surprised and deeply disappointed\" by the decision.</p><p class=\"\">China also announced export controls on scarce elements that are critical for making electronics, including tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum, and indium. China is a big miner of these materials.</p><p class=\"\">Corrections &amp; Amplifications: China plans to impose 10% tariffs on U.S. crude oil, machinery, and some cars, plus 15% tariffs on coal and liquefied natural gas products. A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the goods affected by the 10% and 15% tariffs.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.com and Callum Keown at callum.keown@dowjones.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Many of Australia's biggest listed companies will report earnings this month, giving investors the chance to do a pulse check on trading conditions. Strategist Richard Schellbach highlights prior concerns about companies' ability to maintain profit margins. But these concerns were unfounded, UBS says, as management was able to pass costs on to their customers. \"The latest monthly data points still show business selling prices moving commensurately with their input costs,\" UBS says. And with the unemployment rate remaining low over the past six months, \"this dynamic of being able to pass through costs remains favorable in most industries,\" UBS adds.
