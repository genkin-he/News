The incentive scheme comprises a Performance Share Plan.</p><p class=\"\">The objectives of the share-based long-term incentive scheme are to align the interests of Wärtsilä's management and key employees with those of the company's shareholders and, thus, to promote shareholder value creation in the long term, and to commit management and key employees to achieving Wärtsilä's strategic targets.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Performance Share Plan 2025-2027</strong></p><p class=\"\">The Board of Directors of Wärtsilä has resolved on the target group, the amount of the possible rewards and the performance criteria for the Performance Share Plan 2025-2027. The potential share reward, which is subject to the achievement of the set performance criteria, is paid in listed shares of Wärtsilä in spring 2028.</p><p class=\"\">During the performance period 2025-2027, the earning of rewards is based on the Economic Value Added (EVA) (80% weight) and Sustainability Targets according to decarbonisation strategy (20% weight). Wärtsilä's decarbonisation strategy is to become carbon neutral in own operations, and to have a product portfolio ready for zero carbon fuels.</p><p class=\"\">The aggregate maximum number of shares payable as a reward based on this first plan is approximately 1,850,000 shares (gross earnings before the withholding of the applicable payroll tax). The target group of the performance period 2025-2027 consists of approximately 180 key employees, including the President &amp; CEO and the Board of Management.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Restricted Share Plan 2025-2027 </strong></p><p class=\"\">The Board of Directors has also resolved on a Restricted Share Plan 2025-2027 as a share-based retention plan for individually selected key employees in specific situations.</p><p class=\"\">The Restricted Share Plan 2025-2027 comprises a retention period with an overall length of three years, extended to the first half of the fourth year, during which the company may grant fixed share rewards to individually selected key employees. The granted share rewards are paid to the selected participants in three separate share tranches annually during the retention period, unless the company resolves to pay individual share grants in one instalment. The share rewards are paid in listed shares of Wärtsilä.</p><p class=\"\">The aggregate maximum number of shares to be paid as a reward based on the plan is approximately 150,000 shares (gross earning before the withholding of the applicable payroll tax).</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Other terms</strong></p><p class=\"\">The value of the reward payable to participants based on the plans is limited by a maximum cap, which is linked to a multiplier of the individual's annual gross base salary. If the individual's employment with Wärtsilä terminates before the payment of the reward, the individual is not, as a main rule, entitled to any reward based on the respective plan.</p><p class=\"\">Wärtsilä applies a share ownership recommendation to the members of the company's Board of Management. According to this recommendation, each member of Wärtsilä's Board of Management is expected to retain in his/her ownership at least half of the shares received under the share-based incentive plans of the company, until the value of his/her share ownership in the company corresponds to at least his/her annual gross base salary. </p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">For further information, please contact:</strong></p><p class=\"\">Teija Sarajärvi</p><p class=\"\">Executive Vice President, Human Resources</p><p class=\"\">Tel: +358 10 709 5010</p><p class=\"\">teija.sarajarvi@wartsila.com</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">For investor information, please contact:</strong></p><p class=\"\">Hanna-Maria Heikkinen</p><p class=\"\">Vice President, Investor Relations</p><p class=\"\">Tel: +358 10 709 1461</p><p class=\"\">hanna-maria.heikkinen@wartsila.com</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Wärtsilä in brief</strong></p><p class=\"\">Wärtsilä is a global leader in innovative technologies and lifecycle solutions for the marine and energy markets.
