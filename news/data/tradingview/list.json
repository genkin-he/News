The company reported record sales and gross profit, despite facing some challenges related to legacy pension plans and acquisition costs.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Financial Highlights</strong></p> <p class=\"\">For the second quarter, Lancaster Colony reported consolidated net sales of $509.3 million, a 4.8% increase from $485.9 million in the same period last year. The company's consolidated gross profit rose by 9.3% to $132.8 million, setting a new second-quarter record. However, net income declined to $49.0 million, or $1.78 per diluted share, compared to $51.5 million, or $1.87 per diluted share, in the previous year. This decline was primarily due to a $14.0 million noncash settlement charge related to the termination of legacy pension plans and $1.6 million in incremental SG&amp;A expenditures for a planned acquisition.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Business and Operational Highlights</strong></p> <p class=\"\">The Retail segment saw a 6.3% increase in net sales to $280.8 million, driven by growth in both licensing programs and the company's own brands. Notable contributions came from Texas Roadhouse® dinner rolls, Buffalo Wild Wings® sauces, Subway® sauces, and Olive Garden® dressings. The Foodservice segment also experienced a 3.0% increase in net sales to $228.5 million, led by higher demand from national chain restaurant accounts and increased sales of branded Foodservice products.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments</strong></p> <p class=\"\">During the quarter, Lancaster Colony announced the planned acquisition of an Atlanta-based sauce and dressing production facility, which is expected to close in the fiscal third quarter ending March 31, 2025. This acquisition is anticipated to enhance the company's manufacturing network by improving operational efficiency, increasing capacity, and providing closer proximity to core customers.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Management's Perspective</strong></p> <p class=\"\">CEO David A. Ciesinski expressed satisfaction with the company's performance, highlighting record sales, gross profit, and operating income. He attributed the Retail segment's growth to the success of licensing programs and the company's own brands, while the Foodservice segment benefited from increased demand from national chain restaurant accounts. Ciesinski also emphasized the positive impact of ongoing cost savings initiatives and modest cost deflation on the company's gross profit margin.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Future Outlook</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Looking ahead to the fiscal third quarter, Lancaster Colony expects continued growth in the Retail segment from its expanding licensing program and investments in brand innovation. The Foodservice segment is also projected to see growth from select national chain restaurant accounts. The company is optimistic about the strategic benefits of the upcoming acquisition of the Atlanta-based production facility.</p><p class=\"\">SEC Filing: <a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/57515/000005751525000004/lanc-20250204.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">LANCASTER COLONY CORP [ LANC ] - 8-K - Feb. 04, 2025</a></p></span></div>",

(or “IES” or the “Company”)  today announced financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2024.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">First</strong><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"> Quarter </strong><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">2025</strong><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"> Highlights and Recent Developments</strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Revenue of $750 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, an increase of 18% compared with $634 million for the same quarter of fiscal 2024</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Operating income of $74.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, an increase of 29% compared with $58.0 million for the same quarter of fiscal 2024</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Net income attributable to IES of $56.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, an increase of 37% compared with $41.0 million for the same quarter of fiscal 2024, and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders of $2.72 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with $1.87 for the same quarter of fiscal 2024</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted net income attributable to IES (a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined below) of $54.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, an increase of 33% compared with $40.9 million for the same quarter of fiscal 2024, and diluted adjusted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders of $2.64 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with $1.86 for the same quarter of fiscal 2024</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Remaining performance obligations, a GAAP measure of future revenue to be recognized from current contracts with customers, of approximately $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2024</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Backlog (a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined below) of approximately $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2024</li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Overview of Results</strong>“Entering fiscal 2025, our teams have continued to execute well, driving an 18% increase in revenue and a 29% increase in operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared with the same quarter of the prior year,\" said Jeff Gendell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"Our Communications, Infrastructure Solutions, and Commercial &amp; Industrial segments continued to benefit from strong demand, particularly in the data center market. While revenue in our Residential segment increased modestly over the first quarter of fiscal 2024 due to weather-related impacts on demand in Florida, we have begun to see normalization of activity in this key market. Operating margins across all businesses remained strong, reflecting robust customer demand, operating leverage from our increased scale and strong project execution. We continue to focus on growing our HVAC and plumbing business across our Residential segment's electrical markets as well as expanding the operations of our Infrastructure Solutions business.\"</p><p class=\"\">Our Communications segment’s revenue was $232.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, an increase of 36% compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Increased demand across the business, particularly in the data center end market, drove growth, while demand in the high-tech manufacturing and distribution center end markets also remained solid. The segment's operating income increased to $28.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with $21.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, as we benefited from increased volumes and strong project execution.</p><p class=\"\">Our Residential segment’s revenue was $320.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, an increase of 1% compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Single-family demand was impacted by the recent hurricanes in Florida, as well as concerns over housing affordability and consumer expectations about future interest rate reductions. However, our business benefited from the expansion of our plumbing and HVAC service offerings, while successful execution of backlog contributed to revenue growth in our multi-family business. The Residential segment’s operating income decreased slightly to $23.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with $24.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. An improvement in gross margin driven by strong project execution and reduced material costs was offset by increased general and administrative expense, as we continue to invest in processes and personnel to support the future growth of the business.</p><p class=\"\">Our Infrastructure Solutions segment’s revenue was $108.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, an increase of $45.2 million or 72% compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2024, driven by continued strong demand in our custom engineered solutions business, including generator enclosures, primarily for the data center end market. Greiner Industries, which we acquired on April 1, 2024, contributed $12.2 million of the increase. Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $23.3 million, compared with $10.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The year-over-year profit improvement was driven primarily by a combination of higher volumes, improved pricing and operating efficiencies at our facilities as well as the impact of investments we have made over the last several years to increase capacity.</p><p class=\"\">Our Commercial &amp; Industrial segment’s revenue was $88.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, an increase of 4% compared with $85.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, while segment operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $7.1 million, compared with $7.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. These results reflect solid demand and strong execution across the segment.</p><p class=\"\">Matt Simmes, President and Chief Operating Officer, commented, “During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we continued to benefit from the ongoing investments we have made in our business, while maintaining strong operating margins across all operating segments. Although the hurricanes that affected Florida in September and October 2024 did not have a significant impact on our overall Residential business in the quarter, Florida housing starts were negatively impacted by the storms. Demand in the Florida market has begun to show signs of recovering in the second fiscal quarter, and we anticipate continued improvement through the remainder of fiscal 2025. Although housing affordability and interest rate issues have resulted in some pockets of reduced demand in certain of our Residential segment's single-family markets, we have focused on maintaining margins and continuing to invest in the scalability of our platform, including a new ERP system, as we believe the longer-term outlook for single-family housing to be strong. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, our Infrastructure Solutions business completed the acquisition of Arrow Engine Company, a Tulsa, Oklahoma based provider of engines, generator sets, compressors and replacement parts primarily for the natural gas production market. This business provides us with the opportunity to continue to expand our product offerings and customer base.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Capital Allocation; Stock Buyback Plan</strong>“We remain focused on capital allocation, seeking to generate strong returns on our operating cash flow,\" added Tracy McLauchlin, Chief Financial Officer. \"The continued strength of our cash flow allowed us to put capital to work while ending the quarter with $59.1 million of cash and $53.0 million of marketable securities.\"</p><p class=\"\">Capital allocation highlights include the following:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">We supported the growth of our operating business with $13.2 million in capital expenditures during the first quarter of fiscal 2025</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Subsequent to quarter end, we enhanced our financial flexibility by increasing our revolving credit facility from $150 million to $300 million, extending its maturity to 2030 and transitioning away from the previous asset-based structure</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">In December 2024, we invested $44.9 million to acquire a minority interest in the CB&amp;I storage solutions business, a designer and builder of storage facilities, tanks and terminals for energy and industrial markets</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Subsequent to quarter end, we acquired Arrow Engine Company</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we repurchased 21,048 shares of our common stock for $4.4 million, ending the quarter with $193.7 million remaining under our stock repurchase authorization</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">We used $16.1 million of our excess cash to purchase marketable securities during the first quarter of fiscal 2025</li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Adjustments</strong>This press release includes adjusted net income attributable to IES, adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders, and backlog, and, in the non-GAAP reconciliation tables included herein, adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income before taxes, each of which is a financial measure not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). Management believes that these measures provide useful information to our investors by, in the case of adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders, adjusted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income before taxes, distinguishing certain nonrecurring events such as litigation settlements, significant expenses associated with leadership changes, or gains or losses from the sale of a business, or noncash events, such as impairment charges or unrealized gains and losses on our investments, or, in the case of backlog, providing a common measurement used in IES's industry, as described further below, and that these measures, when reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, help our investors to better identify underlying trends in the operations of our business and facilitate easier comparisons of our financial performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release.</p><p class=\"\">Remaining performance obligations represent the unrecognized revenue value of our contract commitments. While backlog is not a defined term under GAAP, it is a common measurement used in IES’s industry and IES believes this non-GAAP measure enables it to more effectively forecast its future results and better identify future operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. IES’s remaining performance obligations are a component of IES’s backlog calculation, which also includes signed agreements and letters of intent which we do not have a legal right to enforce prior to work starting. These arrangements are excluded from remaining performance obligations until work begins. IES’s methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by other companies.</p><p class=\"\">For further details on the Company’s financial results, please refer to the Company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024, to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") by February 4, 2025, and any amendments thereto.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About IES Holdings, Inc.</strong>IES designs and installs integrated electrical and technology systems and provides infrastructure products and services to a variety of end markets, including data centers, residential housing, and commercial and industrial facilities.

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “project,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “pursue,” “target,” “continue,” the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company’s actual future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, a general reduction in the demand for our products or services; changes in general economic conditions, including supply chain constraints, high rates of inflation, changes in consumer sentiment, elevated interest rates, and market disruptions resulting from a number of factors, including geo-political events; competition in the industries in which we operate, which could result in the loss of one or more customers or lead to lower margins on new projects; our ability to successfully manage and execute projects, the cost and availability of qualified labor and the ability to maintain positive labor relations, and our ability to pass along increases in the cost of commodities used in our business; supply chain disruptions due to our suppliers' access to materials and labor, their ability to ship products timely, or credit or liquidity problems they may face; inaccurate estimates used when entering into fixed-price contracts, the possibility of errors when estimating revenue and progress to date on percentage-of-completion contracts, and complications associated with the incorporation of new accounting, control and operating procedures; our ability to enter into, and the terms of, future contracts; the existence of a small number of customers from whom we derive a meaningful portion of our revenues; reliance on third parties, including subcontractors and suppliers, to complete our projects; the inability to carry out plans and strategies as expected, including the inability to identify and complete acquisitions that meet our investment criteria, or the subsequent underperformance of those acquisitions; challenges integrating new businesses into the Company or new types of work, products or processes into our segments; backlog that may not be realized or may not result in profits; failure to adequately recover on contract change orders or claims against customers; closures or sales of our facilities resulting in significant future charges or a significant disruption of our operations; the impact of future epidemics or pandemics on our business; an increased cost of surety bonds affecting margins on work and the potential for our surety providers to refuse bonding or require additional collateral at their discretion; the impact of seasonality, adverse weather conditions, and climate change; fluctuations in operating activity due to factors such as cyclicality, downturns in levels of construction or the housing market, and differing regional economic conditions; difficulties in managing our billings and collections; accidents resulting from the physical hazards associated with our work and the potential for accidents; the possibility that our current insurance coverage may not be adequate or that we may not be able to obtain policies at acceptable rates; the effect of litigation, claims and contingencies, including warranty losses, damages or other latent defect claims in excess of our existing reserves and accruals; costs and liabilities under existing or potential future laws and regulations, including those laws and regulations related to the environment and climate change, as well as the inability to transfer, renew and obtain electrical and other professional licenses; interruptions to our information systems and cyber security or data breaches; expenditures to conduct environmental remediation activities required by certain environmental laws and regulations; loss of key personnel, ineffective transition of new management, or general labor constraints; credit and capital market conditions, including changes in interest rates that affect the cost of construction financing and mortgages, and the inability of some of our customers to obtain sufficient financing at acceptable rates, which could lead to project delays or cancellations; limitations on our ability to access capital markets and generate cash from operations to fund our capital needs; the impact on our effective tax rate or cash paid for taxes from changes in tax positions we have taken or changes in tax laws; difficulty in fulfilling the covenant terms of our revolving credit facility, which could result in a default and acceleration of any indebtedness under such revolving credit facility; reliance on certain estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results in the preparation of our financial statements; uncertainties inherent in the use of percentage-of-completion accounting, which could result in the reduction or elimination of previously recorded revenues and profits; the recognition of potential goodwill, long-lived assets and other investment impairments; the existence of a controlling shareholder, who has the ability to take action not aligned with other shareholders or to dispose of all or a significant portion of the shares of our common stock it holds, which may trigger certain change of control provisions in a number of our material agreements; the relatively low trading volume of our common stock, which could increase the volatility of our stock price and could make it more difficult for shareholders to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which shareholders could sell a smaller number of shares; the possibility that we issue additional shares of common stock, preferred stock or convertible securities that will dilute the percentage ownership interest of existing stockholders and may dilute the value per share of our common stock; the potential for substantial sales of our common stock, which could adversely affect our stock price; the impact of increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors and customers, or new or changing regulations, with respect to environmental, social and governance practices; the cost or effort required for our shareholders to bring certain claims or actions against us, as a result of our designation of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings; and the possibility that our internal controls over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent all possible errors that could occur, as well as other risk factors discussed in this document, in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2024 and in the Company’s other reports on file with the SEC. You should understand that such risk factors could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those experienced previously or those expressed in such forward-looking statements.

The Big One Property is a new discoverywith assays up to 79.01 g/t gold (2.54 oz/t gold)and 3157.89 g/t silver (101.5 oz/t silver) from &gt;200 gold-silver-copper rich polymetallic veins up to8 m wide and striking for up to 500 m that remain open. These veinswere identified along the newly discovered 11 km Highway of Goldsurrounding the Eldorado porphyry system on the Big One property. Thediscovery is located in an area of glacial and snowpack abatementadjacent to the world-class gold-rich porphyry systems at GaloreCreek. The property covers 33,693 hectares in world-class geologicterrane with tremendous additional discovery potential in the heart ofthe Golden Triangle, British Columbia.

Even more exciting is the fact that themineralization observed on the surface is indicative of a much largerprecious and base metal porphyry system or systems at depth. To have100 % control over a district-scale property of this caliber locatedin world-class geologic terrane in close proximity to a Tier 1 depositthe likes of Galore Creek is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. With~95 % of the Big One property remaining unexplored and hosting vastareas of newly exposed outcrop due to glacial and snowpack retreat, itprovides for excellent additional long-term discovery potential. TheBig One discovery has already garnered serious interest from multipleminers and institutions alike.

Prospective areas included, butwere not limited to, proximity to MINFile locations, placer creekoccurrences, regional soil anomalies, andpotential gossans based on high-resolution satellite imagery. The rockgrab and chip samples were extracted using a rock hammer, or hammerand chisel to expose fresh surfaces and to liberate a sample ofanywhere between 0.5 to 5.0 kilograms. All sample sites were flaggedwith biodegradable flagging tape and marked with the sample number.All sample sites were recorded using hand-held GPS units (accuracy3-10 meters) and sample ID, easting, northing, elevation, type ofsample (outcrop, subcrop, float, talus, chip, grab, etc.) and adescription of the rock were recorded on all-weather paper. Sampleswere then inserted in a clean plastic bag with a sample tag fortransport and shipping to the geochemistry lab. QA/QC samplesincluding blanks, standards, and duplicate samples were insertedregularly into the sample sequence at a rate of 10%.</p><p class=\"\">All samples are transported in rice bags sealed withnumbered security tags. A transport company takes them from the coreshack to the Paragon Geochemical labs facilities in Surrey, BC or ALSlabs facilities in North Vancouver, BC. Paragon Geochemical iscertified with both AC89-IAS and ISO/IEC Standard 17025:2017. ALS iseither certified to ISO 9001:2008 or accredited to ISO 17025:2005 inall of its locations. Samples submitted to Paragon received gold andsilver analysis by photon assay whereby the entire sample is crushedto approximately 70% passing 2 mm mesh. The entire crushed sample isriffle split and weighed into multiple (300-500g) jars that aresubmitted for photon assay. Photon assay uses high-energy X-rays(photons) to excite atomic nuclei within the jarred samples, causingthem to emit secondary gamma rays, which are measured to identify andquantify the metals present. The assays from all jars are combined ona weight-averaged basis. At ALS samples were processed, dried,crushed, and pulverized before analysis using the ME-MS61 and Au-SCR21methods. For the ME-MS61 method, a prepared sample is digested withperchloric, nitric, hydrofluoric, and hydrochloric acids. The residueis topped up with dilute hydrochloric acid and analyzed by inductivelycoupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. Overlimits werere-analyzed using the ME-OG62 and Ag-GRA21 methods (gravimetricfinish). For Au-SCR21 a large volume of sample is needed (typically1-3kg). The sample is crushed and screened (usually to -106 micron) toseparate coarse gold particles from fine material. After screening,two aliquots of the fine fraction are analysed using the traditionalfire assay method. The fine fraction is expected to be reasonablyhomogenous and well represented by the duplicate analyses.

Having a razorlike focus toward this goal is paramount and leads to incredible social impact.\"</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Lenny Greene</strong>, President and CEO of Greene Concepts, remarks, \"This partnership tackles the urgent challenge of water scarcity while establishing large-scale systems for delivering fresh, pristine water directly to homes domestically. The aquifers in North Carolina and Tennessee will be key sources, particularly for underserved domestic communities. This initiative also aligns with our previous announcement of a large-scale water refill station at our Marion, NC bottling facility.\"</p><p class=\"\">Mr. Greene concludes, \"Percy, Vickye, and the entire Prevail Water team, each bring unparalleled expertise to this collaboration where we'll be able to mobilize on demand to quickly deploy water to areas and people in need and that desire easier access to fresh artesian spring water.
