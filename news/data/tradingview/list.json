The two drills are now testing the deep extension of the Jubilee shear beyond the 2024 Mineral Resource Estimate (“<strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">MRE</strong>”) with three drill holes now completed. The Company has also received assay results from the relogging of 2024 drill holes designed to test the Jubilee Shear south of the Parkhill Fault.</p><p class=\"\">Michael Michaud, President and CEO of Red Pine commented: “We are excited to commence drilling the Jubilee Shear at depth which has already intersected alteration, veining and visible gold, confirming that the deposit is larger than defined in the MRE.

This drilling provided visibility on a sizeable gold system in that area with the intersection of local zones of higher-grade gold mineralization, quartz veins containing visible gold and several lower grade intercepts. We are excited about these initial drilling results as they confirm the extension of the Jubilee Shear and the potential to host higher-grade shoots that are interpreted to occur in an area deeper than the recently completed drilling.</p><p class=\"\">The new drilling also confirms the orientation of the Parkhill Fault and outlines potential down-plunge extensions ranging from 300 m to more than 500 m from the current zones of mineralization forming the MRE.”</p><p class=\"\">The MRE is described in the National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report dated September 30, 2024 (with a resource effective date of August 28, 2024) entitled “National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report for the Wawa Gold Project” (the “<strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">2024 Technical Report</strong>”).</p><p class=\"\">Drilling Highlights and Discussion of Results (Table 1 and Figure 1 and 2):</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Jubilee Shear</strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Visible gold observed in quartz veins in the Jubilee Shear in both SD-25-531, 170 m down-plunge, and in SD-25-532, 100 m up-plunge of the MRE (see Figures 1 and 2);</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">SD-25-531 is currently the deepest intersection in the Jubilee Shear in the history of the Wawa Gold Project;</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Intersection of 5.81 g/t Au over 2.16 m in the Jubilee Shear beyond the boundaries of the MRE;</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Extension of the Minto Vein more than 100 m away from the closest drill hole at the southern end of the Minto Deposit;</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Defined the orientation of Parkhill Fault which now supports a probable plunge extension ranging from 300 m to &gt; 500 m for the southernmost mineralization zones that are included in the MRE in the Jubilee Shear.</li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Jubilee Shear south of the Parkhill Fault</strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Limited drilling started and completed in late 2024 tested the extension of the Jubilee Shear approximately 850 m south of the MRE.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Initial results from this previously undrilled area have now been received.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Multi-pronged media campaign to raise awareness about the disease and its impact on patients, family members and caregivers.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Interactive, stand-alone NETHERTON NOW website launched.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Quoin’s QRX003 product is on track to obtain the first regulatory approval for Netherton Syndrome.</li></ul><p class=\"\">ASHBURN, Va., Feb.  04, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Quoin Pharmaceuticals Ltd.  (the “Company” or “Quoin”), a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on rare and orphan diseases, has launched the “NETHERTON NOW” campaign to shed light on the profound and poorly understood impacts of Netherton Syndrome, a devastating genetic disease that has been significantly misdiagnosed in the past. It is estimated that up to 20% of babies born with Netherton Syndrome do not survive, highlighting the urgent need for greater awareness and new treatment options.</p><p class=\"\">Netherton Syndrome patients suffer from excess skin shedding as well as red, scaly skin that can cause painful itching and severe infections that can potentially lead to hospitalization, asthma, allergies and possibly skin cancer. They are also susceptible to water loss through the skin’s surface and are always at risk of dehydration. This chronic condition severely impacts every aspect of life for patients and their families, yet it remains inadequately understood and poorly addressed by current treatment options.</p><p class=\"\">Currently, Quoin is conducting four ongoing clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of QRX003, in Netherton Syndrome patients. Recently announced clinical data by Quoin has underscored the product’s potential efficacy as a treatment for the disease. Quoin has also released photographic evidence highlighting the dramatic impact on a patient’s skin after 12 weeks of dosing with QRX003. These photographs are accessible via this link. https://quoinpharma.com/pipeline/#trials </p><p class=\"\">“The positive clinical data we’ve shared recently provides significant validation for QRX003 as a potentially safe and effective treatment for Netherton Syndrome,” said Quoin CEO Dr. Michael Myers. “We are eagerly anticipating the initiation of our ‘whole body’ clinical study, which will be conducted by Dr. Amy Paller at Northwestern University. This groundbreaking study, which has been cleared to proceed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is a landmark event in the clinical development of QRX003. As we continue to assemble a robust data package in support of our regulatory approval filings in the US, EU and in the 61 countries where we have established commercial partnerships, our commitment to the Netherton community is unwavering. Hearing from patients every day about the frustrations and challenges of living with this disease further fuels our determination to deliver a safe and effective treatment that can deliver hope where there is currently none.”</p><p class=\"\">The NETHERTON NOW website serves as a comprehensive resource hub, providing a platform for patients and families to share experiences and build connections, while also offering educational materials and updates on research advancements to raise public awareness about Netherton Syndrome.</p><p class=\"\">Quoin Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer Denise Carter said, “We regularly hear from members of the Netherton community about their deep sense of feeling unseen, unheard, and ignored. Because of the lack of awareness about Netherton Syndrome, it can sometimes take months, and even years, before these patients are properly diagnosed, and once they have that diagnosis, they are informed that there is currently no approved treatment or cure. One key goal of our NETHERTON NOW campaign is to shine a spotlight on the urgent need for a better understanding of the profound physical, emotional, and social challenges people with this disease face every day. With the launch of the ‘NETHERTON NOW’ campaign, we aim not only to raise awareness but also to foster advocacy, education, and compassion for those affected by this devastating disease. We continue to collaborate closely with clinicians, patients, families, and advocacy groups, and we deeply value the insights and the support these communities have provided in our efforts to bring hope to those impacted by the disease.</p><p class=\"\">“Until there is an FDA-approved therapy for Netherton Syndrome, we remain steadfast in our mission to bring this disease out of the shadows and in our unwavering commitment to delivering solutions that address it at its core. The time to act is now—because everyone deserves to feel comfortable in their own skin.”</p><p class=\"\">Patients and families interested in participating in clinical studies or receiving updates can sign up for alerts at nethertonnow.com.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Netherton Syndrome</strong></p><p class=\"\">Netherton Syndrome, a form of Ichthyosis, is a rare hereditary skin disorder caused by a mutation in the SPINK5 gene (serine protease inhibitor, Kazal Type 5) that leads to severe skin barrier defects and recurring infections, as well as a pronounced predisposition to allergies, asthma, and eczema. Patients often suffer from severe dehydration, chronic skin inflammation and stunted growth. Currently, there is no cure for Netherton Syndrome, nor are there any approved therapeutic treatments.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About QRX003</strong></p><p class=\"\">QRX003 is a topical lotion formulated with a proprietary delivery technology that contains a broad-spectrum serine protease inhibitor, whose mechanism of action is intended to perform the function of a specific protein called LEKTI. The absence of LEKTI in Netherton patients leads to excessive skin shedding, resulting in a highly porous and compromised skin barrier. QRX003 is designed to promote a more normalized skin-shedding process and the formation of a stronger and more effective skin barrier.</p><p class=\"\">For more information about Quoin’s current clinical trials please visit: https://quoinpharma.com/pipeline/#trials</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Quoin Pharmaceuticals Ltd.</strong></p><p class=\"\">Quoin Pharmaceuticals Ltd. is a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic products that treat rare and orphan diseases.

These non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial information and financial outlook presented in this press release that is calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and these non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management believes that they supplement or enhance management's, analysts' and investors' overall understanding of the Company's underlying financial performance and trends and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods.</p><p class=\"\">Because the non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered superior to and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP financial measures presented in the press release and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in the method of calculation and in the items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.</p><p class=\"\">EBITDAR which is defined as Operating income (loss), plus depreciation, amortization, interest, taxes and aircraft rent is an important metric to be considered to allow investors to compare results across different airlines regardless of how the airlines acquired their aircraft. This distinction is important when comparing the operational results of an airline leasing its aircraft versus an airline purchasing its aircraft. Specifically, the airline leasing aircraft would see the costs relating to those aircraft flow through aircraft rent, while an airline that owns their aircraft would see their costs for those aircraft flow through depreciation and amortization. In order to compare the operating results of the two airlines an investor needs to look at EBITDAR which is why it is presented.</p><p class=\"\">A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due as management believes creation of this reconciliation would not be practicable due to the uncertainty regarding, and potential variability of, material reconciling items.</p><p class=\"\">Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information</p><p class=\"\">This press release contains certain “forward-looking statements” and “forward-looking information”, as defined under applicable United States and Canadian securities laws, concerning anticipated developments and events that may occur in the future. Forward-looking statements contained in this press release include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the </p><p class=\"\">Company’s financial performance, continued growth, execution of the Company’s strategic plan, future flight revenue, financial outlook for revenue, EBITDA, EBITDAR and block hours, the achievement of the Company’s goals moving forward, plans for aircraft fleet growth and delivery timelines, the timeline for release of financial results, the Company’s status as the Nation’s fastest growing charter airline and the Company’s growth plans. In certain cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"plans\", \"expects\" \"budget\", \"scheduled\", \"estimates\", \"forecasts\", \"intends\", \"anticipates\" or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"would\", \"might\" or \"will be taken\", \"occur\" or \"be achieved\" suggesting future outcomes, or other expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, intentions or statements about future events or performance. Forward-looking statements contained in this press release is based on certain factors and assumptions regarding, among other things, the receipt of financing to continue airline operations, the accuracy, reliability and success of GlobalX’s business model; GlobalX’s ability to accurately forecast demand; GlobalX will be able to successfully conclude definitive agreements for transactions subject to LOI; the timely receipt of governmental approvals; the success of airline operations of GlobalX; GlobalX’s ability to successfully enter new geographic markets; the legislative and regulatory environments of the jurisdictions where GlobalX will carry on business or have operations; the Company has or will have sufficient aircraft to provide the service; the impact of competition and the competitive response to GlobalX’s business strategy; the future price of fuel, and the availability of aircraft. While the Company considers these assumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available to it, they may prove to be incorrect.</p><p class=\"\">Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. The Company has identified certain known material risk factors applicable to it in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC and its other filings with the SEC. Moreover, it is not always possible for the Company to predict how new risks and uncertainties that arise from time to time may affect it. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this press release. Except as required by applicable securities laws, the Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. If GlobalX does update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be made that it will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Preliminary Financial Data</strong></p><p class=\"\">The financial information included in this press release is subject to completion of the Company’s year-end close procedures and further financial review. The Company has provided guidance ranges, rather than specific amounts, because these results are preliminary and subject to change. Actual results may differ from these estimates as a result of the completion of the Company’s year-end closing procedures, review adjustments and other developments that may arise between now and the time such financial information for the period is finalized. As a result, these estimates are preliminary, may change and constitute forward-looking information and, as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties. These preliminary estimates should not be viewed as a substitute for full financial statements prepared in accordance with United States GAAP, and they should not be viewed as indicative of the Company’s results for any future period. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has not audited, reviewed, compiled, or performed any procedures with respect to these estimated financial results and, accordingly, does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to these preliminary estimates.</p></span></div>",
