            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Ying Xian Wong and Fabiana Negrin Ochoa</p><p class=\"\">Indonesia's economy grew at a steady pace in 2024 as momentum picked up in the final quarter of the year, signaling stability but a long road ahead to the government's lofty growth aims.</p><p class=\"\">Annual growth of 5.03% compared with the 5.05% expansion seen in 2023, the statistics agency said Wednesday. Economists at HSBC and DBS had expected a reading of 5.0%.</p><p class=\"\">That continues a years-long run of growth at a roughly 5% clip, with Southeast Asia's largest economy having expanding at the same pace since about 2016, barring the Covid shock over 2020 and 2021.</p><p class=\"\">Indonesia's resource-rich economy grew 5.02% from a year earlier in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared with a 4.95% expansion in the third quarter. That exceeded economists' expectations, with a Wall Street Journal poll tipping growth at 4.89%.</p><p class=\"\">Things looked dimmer on a quarterly basis, with gross domestic product up just 0.53% in the fourth quarter compared with 1.50% the previous quarter.</p><p class=\"\">All business sectors grew on the year in the last three months of 2024, with the other services industry leading the gains in part thanks to international tourism, said Amalia Adininggar Widyasanti, acting chief of Statistics Indonesia.</p><p class=\"\">Manufacturing--the sector that makes up the biggest share of Indonesia's GDP--grew 4.89% from the prior-year period, she added.</p><p class=\"\">The main contributor to fourth-quarter GDP by expenditure was household consumption, followed by investments. Exports recorded strong growth too, driven by both non-gas and gas shipments.</p><p class=\"\">The data comes as President Prabowo Subianto looks to jumpstart growth during his five-year term. The former general, who was sworn in October last year, has set his sights high, aiming to bring GDP growth to 8%--levels it hasn't reached since the mid 1990s.</p><p class=\"\">To that end, the government has announced a multibillion-dollar stimulus package for 2025 and joined the BRICS organization as a full member in January, a move that could draw in more investment and trade.</p><p class=\"\">Parliament this week also approved the Daya Anagata Nusantara Agency for Investment Management, Indonesia's new sovereign wealth fund.</p><p class=\"\">Danantara, as the fund is known, is modeled after state investment entities like Singapore's Temasek and Norway's Norges Bank Investment Management, Citi Research analyst Ferry Wong said. Assets totaling about $600 billion place Danantara as one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds, with the aim of managing Indonesia's state-owned assets to bolster economic growth and enhance global competitiveness, he said in a note.</p><p class=\"\">The government is also looking to harness more of the country's abundant natural resources by requiring exporters to keep all proceeds onshore for at least one year.</p><p class=\"\">The repatriation regulation change, set to kick in March 1st, could strain businesses' cashflows but shows \"the government's commitment to bringing USD back onshore and boosting FX reserves, with expectations of up to US$90 billion in inflows,\" UOB economist Enrico Tanuwidjaja said.</p><p class=\"\">Increased onshore dollar liquidity is anticipated to boost foreign-exchange and bond market activity, and if a significant portion of the proceeds are converted into IDR, could strengthen the rupiah, he added in a report.</p><p class=\"\">But with trade uncertainties mounting, and Indonesia's economy vulnerable to commodity price shocks, it remains to be seen if the policy efforts will pay off.</p><p class=\"\">Current indicators suggest that economic growth will likely remain around 5% this year, ANZ economists Arindam Chakraborty and Sanjay Mathur said in a recent note. While the Indonesian government's focus on welfare-driven spending could help support consumption, the 2025 budget looks conservative, they added.</p><p class=\"\">Capital Economics' senior Asia economist, Gareth Leather, thinks growth has been accelerating, but is not as stable as official figures suggest.</p><p class=\"\">\"We expect growth to slow on our measure of activity as the impact of lower commodity prices and subdued global demand offsets the boost from lower interest rates,\" he said.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Ying Xian Wong at yingxian.wong@wsj.com</p></span></div>",
