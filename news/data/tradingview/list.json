            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Al Root</p><p class=\"\">Tesla stock was falling in premarket trading on Wednesday as investors continued to digest a busy week of politics.</p><p class=\"\">Investors are always on the lookout that CEO Elon Musk's political leanings are hurting his car company. Definitive evidence isn't easy to find. Some mounting evidence might show that the iconoclast turns off Californians.</p><p class=\"\">Tesla stock was 0.9% down in premarket trading at $388.59 while S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were 0.5% and 0.2% down, respectively. Coming into Wednesday trading, Tesla stock was off about 3% for the week after a 5% plunge on Monday.</p><p class=\"\">President Trump's 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports roiled most auto stocks on Monday. Tesla was hit harder than most, possibly because of Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency.</p><p class=\"\">Elon Musk is the head of DOGE, which recently gained access to the Treasury payments system, giving it the ability to potentially defund government departments by stopping payments, causing an uproar. Critics such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren called the  moves illegal. Musk said DOGE was acting at the  behest of the president.</p><p class=\"\">Whatever the back and forth, Monday shone another spotlight on Musk's political activities.</p><p class=\"\">So far, investors haven't appeared to care about Musk's involvement in the Trump administration. Coming into Wednesday trading, Tesla stock was up about 56% since the Nov. 5 election.</p><p class=\"\">It doesn't mean they won't care eventually. They would need a reason to, though. California might give them some.</p><p class=\"\">Residential solar technology company Enphase reported fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday evening. Sales came in at $383 million, better than Wall Street estimates. The company shipped 152 megawatt hours of battery storage in the quarter. For the first quarter of 2025, Enphase expects sales to come in at about $360 million, with about 160 megawatt hours of battery storage sold. Wall Street was looking for about $350 million in sales and flat storage sales, according to FactSet.</p><p class=\"\">Results and guidance were good enough to initially push Enphase shares up almost 6% in after hours trading on Wednesday.</p><p class=\"\">The crossover between Enphase and Tesla is in residential battery storage. Tesla's Powerwall product competes with Enphase's offerings. Tesla's Powerwall came up on Enphase's earnings conference call. Enphase management wouldn't address market share specifically but talked about their offering being very popular in California. Some of that demand could be coming at the expense of Tesla.</p><p class=\"\">That anecdote, admittedly, doesn't make a strong case for problems at Tesla. Californian EV sales offer some additional evidence, though.</p><p class=\"\">Tesla's Californian sales fell 8% in the fourth quarter, its fifth consecutive quarterly decline. For the year, Tesla's California sales fell about 12%. That's a steeper decline than Tesla's total U.S. sales, which dipped about 6% in 2024.</p><p class=\"\">Sales underperformed in California. That still isn't definitive evidence of a problem. Tesla has more than 50% of the EV market in the state. That's better than Tesla's overall U.S. share of about 49%.</p><p class=\"\">The impact of Musk's politics on Tesla shares is tough to suss out. All investors can do is watch everything, says Nightview Capital director of research Eric Markowitz.</p><p class=\"\">That's sound advice.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Updated guidance reflects consensus expectations in terms of the capex cut, due to lower renewables spending. However, 2025 distributions are lower than expected and the outlook for 2026 distributions remains unclear, they say. The 2025 dividend and buyback of $9 billion is below consensus at $10 billion, while Equinor has scrapped its 2026 buyback guidance. Quarterly earnings beat consensus on net income but are relatively inline on the operating line and on cash flow from operations. Shares trade 3.5% lower at 268.20 Norwegian kroner. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0925 ET - Shifting weather forecasts continue to buffet U.S. natural gas futures, which are adding modestly to yesterday's losses. \"Winter is not yet over,\" EBW Analytics says in a note. \"The near term may see mild weather and bearish risks for Thursday's EIA report-but a subsequent bounce is probable.\" Colder temperatures ahead coupled with a storage deficit are bullish, while medium-term, higher production should be a counterweight, the firm adds. Nymex natural gas is off 0.7% at $3.229/mmBtu. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0854 ET - Equinor is moderating its energy transition plans, which should in theory mean more robust cash flows over time, RBC Capital Markets analysts Biraj Borkhataria and Adnan Dhanani write. The Norwegian energy major's capital allocation plans assume a slowdown in organic offshore wind plans and a slowdown in onshore renewables, they say. Some of its low carbon solutions projects also appear to be slowing, they say. The results look like a slight beat to consensus at the net income level, but guidance for a $5 billion buyback in 2025 is slightly below the $6 billion expected. Total shareholder distributions of $9 billion marks a step down versus 2024 levels of $14.6 billion. \"We think there were some lofty expectations into the event around potential distributions.\" Shares trade 3.2% lower at 268.85 Norwegian kroner. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0847 ET - Oil futures are losing ground after an industry report of a large build in U.S. crude stocks, while the prospect of a trade war fuels concerns about demand. \"All of this tariff talk and general confusion that it's generating is bearish demand as companies can't expand if they don't know what their costs are or what they can sell their goods for,\" Scott Shelton of TP ICAP says in a note. The API reported a 5 million barrel increase in U.S. stocks for last week, analysts note. EIA data inventory are due later this morning, with a Wall Street Journal survey predicting a 1.3 million barrel build. WTI is off 1% at $71.97 a barrel and Brent is down 1.1% at $75.38 a barrel. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0449 ET - China's counter tariffs against the U.S. could affect long-term liquefied natural gas contract negotiations, Goldman Sachs says. Beijing's decision to impose sanctions on American LNG and crude oil is expected to have limited implications for energy prices. This is because affected U.S. volumes are likely to find alternative buyers and China can secure supplies from other sources. But \"we see a potential pause in new long-term LNG contract negotiations between China buyers and U.S. LNG export facilities,\" analysts at the bank say. \"Given that most proposed U.S. LNG facilities require that a significant portion of their capacity is contracted under long-term deals in order to obtain financing, such a pause might delay new U.S. LNG export facilities reaching a final investment decision.\" (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0435 ET - European natural-gas prices rise after settling more than 3% lower in the previous session on news that China's counter tariffs against the U.S. target LNG imports. \"The move could keep more U.S. LNG in the Atlantic and increase demand for the super-chilled fuel elsewhere,\" ANZ Research analysts say. \"The specter of more U.S. LNG in the European market eased concerns of shortages that have emerged this year.\" Still, concerns over fast-depleting inventories across the continent continue to dominate market sentiment, keeping prices sustained. The benchmark Dutch TTF contract is up 1.2% to 52.65 euros a megawatt hour after breaking above 54 euros earlier this week. (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0435 ET - TotalEnergies' fourth-quarter results were better than expected and should lift investor sentiment after a weak third quarter, Quilter Cheviot energy and materials analyst Maurizio Carulli writes. Its earnings were boosted by the stabilization of refining margins, which were particularly low in the prior quarter, he adds. The French oil-and-gas company has navigated a challenging 2024 environment well and its attractive long-term growth profile means it is well-positioned for the future, Carulli adds. TotalEnergies shares rise 1% to 57.56 euros. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0419 ET - TotalEnergies' integrated LNG division meant its fourth-quarter adjusted earnings beat consensus expectations, RBC Capital Markets analysts Biraj Borkhataria and Adnan Dhanani write. The French oil-and-gas company's other divisions were all broadly in line with expectations, they add. Given TotalEnergies hosted its capital markets day in October, is isn't surprising that it didn't outline any major changes to guidance, the analysts write. TotalEnergies shares rise 1% to 57.56 euros. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0409 ET - Oil prices edge lower in early trade despite U.S. President Trump ramping up pressure on Iran. Brent crude is down 0.7% to $75.68 a barrel, while WTI falls 0.6% to $72.25 a barrel. Trump signed a directive restoring his \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Tehran with the aim to stop the country from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Stricter enforcement of sanctions could put as much as 1 million barrels a day of oil supply at risk, according to ING analysts. \"However, reduced flows from Iran will not help in lowering oil prices, something that President Trump is very keen to achieve,\" they say. \"He would need to see OPEC increase oil output to offset any potential Iranian losses.\" Prices are pressured by fears that a trade war between the U.S. and China could hurt global growth and increase inflationary pressures, damping demand for crude. (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0200 ET - Comex gold futures are approaching $2,900/oz on strong bullish momentum, based on daily charts, RHB Retail Research's Joseph Chai says in a research report. Futures saw fresh positive price movements on Tuesday, while they remain on track to test resistance at $2,900/oz, the analyst says. If the commodity rises beyond that mark, it will likely extend gains toward the $3,000/oz level, the analyst says. The 20-day simple moving average is also trending upward, offering extra support for the bullish technical setup, the analyst adds.Spot gold is 0.7% higher at $2,861.48/oz.

It is an essential resource for architects, engineers, developers, urban planners and other professionals navigating the ever-changing international tall building landscape.</p><p class=\"\">\"The global tall building industry is experiencing a dynamic transformation,\" explained <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">CTBUH CEO Javier Quintana de Uña</strong>. \"We continue to witness significant completions and milestones—such as Africa’s first-ever supertall building—and we’re encouraged by an accelerating trend for renewing and repositioning older structures, a movement that simultaneously preserves architectural heritage and advances the prospect of more sustainable urban development.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Key findings from the </strong><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><em>2025 Trends and Forecasts</em> report:</strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">The global count of 200m+ buildings now exceeds 2,400, doubling since 2017.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">2024 marked the 11th consecutive year with over 100 completions of 200m+ buildings.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Iconic Tower, Cairo (393.8m), became Africa’s first supertall (300m+) building and the tallest completion of 2024.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">For the first time, buildings in Egypt and Türkiye entered the World's 100 Tallest Buildings list, marking a significant geographic diversification in high-rise construction.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">A record 256 stalled or “on hold” projects worldwide contributed to fewer completions in 2024, signaling continued challenges into 2025.</li></ul><p class=\"\">“There’s a need for vigilance, too,” continued Quintana de Uña. “The rise in stalled projects underscores the volatility in today’s construction landscape. As we move forward, resilience and adaptability will be crucial in shaping the future of vertical urbanism.\"</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Geographic and functional shifts</strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">China remains a dominant player in the worldwide tall building arena, accounting for more than 60% of global 200m+ completions in 2024. But the composition of the World’s 100 Tallest Buildings is evolving: Asia’s share declined slightly from 63% in 2023 to 61% in 2024, while the Middle East gained one entry, and Africa rejoined the rankings for the first time since 1985.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Mumbai completed five tall buildings this year, the most of any city outside China. From 2020 to 2024, the city added 32 buildings over 200 meters, matching Hangzhou, which ranks 20th globally for such structures. Some projects in Mumbai faced long construction pauses before resuming, highlighting opportunities for future completions. One example is Palais Royale, an imminently anticipated 300m+ tower that began in 2008 and started delivering residences after receiving a partial occupancy permit in October.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Functional shifts are also apparent</strong>: Two new hotel buildings entered the World’s 100 Tallest Buildings list, displacing mixed-use projects, while office and residential tall buildings remained steady at 36 and 10, respectively.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Buildings under 200 meters tall are increasingly being converted or repurposed to meet changing market demands and sustainability goals. With office vacancy rates rising, many of these buildings are being transformed into residential, hotel, or mixed-use spaces. This shift highlights a growing industry preference for adapting and reusing existing structures rather than tearing them down, making better use of underutilized buildings in more flexible and resilient ways.</li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Economic and supply chain pressures</strong></p><p class=\"\">The tall building sector is feeling the impact of rising interest rates, post-pandemic supply chain corrections and tightened financing. Delays in construction timelines have increased, and developers worldwide are reassessing their portfolios amid uncertain economic conditions.</p><p class=\"\">\"The combination of financial uncertainty and evolving urban demand is reshaping the global skyline,\" said <!-- -->Jason Barr, Professor of Economics at Rutgers University-Newark and a member of the CTBUH Height and Data Committee. \"We are witnessing a recalibration period where developers are more cautious, and this is reflected in the number of stalled projects.\"</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Predictions for 2025</strong></p><p class=\"\">At least 135 buildings 200 meters or taller are expected to be completed, with 12 to 20 reaching supertall status (300m+). Jeddah Tower, the world’s first planned 1,000-meter building, resumed construction in late 2024, signaling renewed optimism for megatall (600m+) projects.</p><p class=\"\">While market pressures persist, new geographic entries and advancements in construction technology will shape the next wave of tall buildings. The CTBUH <em>2025 Trends &amp; Forecasts</em> report provides a wide range of interactive data—including breakdowns of the World’s 100 Tallest Buildings by region, function, material, and average height trends—that help industry professionals keep abreast of these developments.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat</strong></p><p class=\"\">The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) is a global nonprofit organization dedicated to smarter, more sustainable cities and a more viable future for global populations.

(OTC Pink: ADIA), an innovator nutritional products and medical treatments, has announced that through collaboration with Adia’s accountant, Adia has appointed a PCAOB (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) accounting firm to conduct a comprehensive third-party audit. This strategic move is part of Adia's plan to uplist its shares from the OTC Pink Sheets to the OTCQB Venture Market, aiming to enhance visibility, attract a broader investor base, and reflect the company's commitment to transparency and growth.</p><p class=\"\">\"Having a fully running business model for the past year, we are now taking this significant step towards uplisting to OTCQB,\" said Larry Powalisz, CEO of Adia Nutrition. \"This audit will not only validate our financial health but also open doors to a new crowd of investors who believe in our mission to revolutionize health and wellness through our unique offerings.\"</p><p class=\"\">The transition to OTCQB is a testament to Adia Nutrition's progress and operational maturity, offering several advantages:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Increased Transparency</strong>: Uplisting requires adherence to higher reporting standards, providing investors with more detailed and timely financial data.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Greater Market Liquidity</strong>: Shares on OTCQB typically experience increased trading volumes, offering better liquidity for shareholders.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Enhanced Investor Confidence</strong>: The audit and uplisting signal to investors that Adia Nutrition operates with integrity and is poised for continued growth.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Broader Accessibility</strong>: The OTCQB platform is more accessible to a wider range of investors, including those who might not typically invest in Pink Sheets securities due to perceived risks.</li></ul><p class=\"\">Adia Nutrition's diverse portfolio, including its groundbreaking work in stem cell therapy through Adia Med, has positioned the company as a pioneer in the health sector.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">3M CO, a diversified technology company known for its innovative products and solutions across various industries, has released its 2024 Form 10-K report. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance, business operations, strategic initiatives, and the challenges it faces in a competitive and evolving market environment.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Financial Highlights</strong></p> <p class=\"\">3M CO reported net sales of $24,575 million for 2024, reflecting a slight decrease of 0.1% from the previous year. The company's operating income margin improved significantly to 19.6%, a notable recovery from the previous year's negative margin, driven by cost reductions and enhanced productivity. Net income from continuing operations was $4,009 million, showcasing a strong recovery supported by strategic cost management and operational efficiencies. Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share increased substantially to $7.26, highlighting the company's improved financial performance and effective cost control measures.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Business Highlights</strong></p> <p class=\"\">3M operates in three main business segments: Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, and Consumer. Each segment leverages 3M's technological expertise to develop innovative products and services.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Safety and Industrial Segment Performance:</strong> This segment saw flat sales in 2024, with growth in roofing granules, industrial adhesives, and tapes, while facing declines in industrial specialties and abrasives. The segment benefited from productivity improvements and spending discipline.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Transportation and Electronics Segment Performance:</strong> Sales in this segment decreased by 1.4% in 2024, with organic sales down 1.0%. The segment experienced growth in electronics but faced challenges in automotive and aerospace due to PFAS-related headwinds.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Consumer Segment Performance:</strong> The Consumer segment experienced a 1.9% decline in sales in 2024, with decreases in home and auto care, packaging, and consumer safety. The segment focused on productivity actions and spending discipline to improve margins.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Geographical Performance:</strong> In 2024, the Americas saw a 1.0% increase in sales, while Asia Pacific and EMEA experienced declines of 1.0% and 2.3%, respectively. The U.S. market remained stable, while China/Hong Kong saw an 8% increase in sales.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Human Capital:</strong> As of December 31, 2024, 3M employed approximately 61,500 people globally, with a focus on health and safety, development, inclusion, and compensation to support its workforce.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Raw Materials:</strong> In 2024, global supply chains stabilized, but 3M faced market inflation driven by key feedstocks and labor. The company mitigated price risks through negotiated supply contracts.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Environmental Compliance:</strong> 3M invested approximately $170 million in 2024 on capital projects for environmental purposes, with plans to increase this investment to $340 million for 2025 and 2026.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Future Outlook:</strong> 3M plans to continue focusing on productivity improvements, restructuring actions, and strategic investments to drive growth across its business segments. The company is also working towards exiting PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025.</li></ul> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Strategic Initiatives</strong></p> <p class=\"\">3M completed the separation of its Health Care business, Solventum, in April 2024, as part of its strategic initiative to streamline operations and focus on core business segments. The company also made changes to its business segment composition to align with this separation. Additionally, 3M is investing in manufacturing and sourcing capabilities to align product capability with sales in major geographic areas, enhancing its global operational efficiency.</p><p class=\"\">3M's capital management activities included the repurchase of $1.8 billion of its own stock in 2024, compared to $33 million in 2023, under a new repurchase program authorizing up to $7.5 billion with no pre-established end date. The company declared dividends of $1.51 per share for the first quarter of 2024 and $0.70 per share for the subsequent quarters, adjusting its dividend post-Solventum spin. 3M also reduced its total debt by $2.9 billion through debt maturities and repayment of commercial paper borrowings.</p><p class=\"\">Looking ahead, 3M plans to continue its focus on strategic capital deployment, including investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability. The company expects to maintain its strong liquidity profile and intends to divest its remaining 19.9% ownership in Solventum within five years from its spin-off. Additionally, 3M aims to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, while managing its debt maturity profile to ensure financial flexibility.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Challenges and Risks</strong></p> <p class=\"\">3M operates in a highly competitive environment, with its business segments facing competition from other technologically oriented companies. The company’s ability to innovate and bring new products to market is crucial for maintaining its competitive edge. The separation of its Health Care business into Solventum Corporation may impact 3M's market position and operational focus.</p><p class=\"\">3M faces significant risks related to the global economy, including geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions, and currency fluctuations. The company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from international markets, making it vulnerable to changes in foreign exchange rates and economic conditions in key regions like China and Europe. Regulatory risks are heightened by increasing scrutiny and regulation of PFAS chemicals, which 3M is phasing out by 2025. Legal liabilities related to PFAS and other environmental issues could materially impact financial results. The company is also exposed to cybersecurity threats, which could disrupt operations and compromise sensitive information. Additionally, the spin-off of Solventum introduces risks related to operational execution and potential dis-synergies.</p><p class=\"\">Management highlights the impact of restructuring activities aimed at improving operational efficiency. The company is focused on mitigating risks associated with supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures on raw materials and labor costs. The exit from PFAS manufacturing is a significant strategic shift, with potential financial and operational implications. The company is also addressing challenges related to the implementation of a global ERP system, which could affect operational continuity if not managed effectively.</p><p class=\"\">3M is exposed to market risks, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which can affect its financial performance. The company’s credit ratings are crucial for maintaining favorable borrowing costs, and any downgrades could increase funding costs. Changes in tax laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and internationally, could also impact the company’s financial results. The company is actively managing these risks through hedging strategies and maintaining strong relationships with credit rating agencies.</p><p class=\"\">SEC Filing: <a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/66740/000006674025000006/mmm-20241231.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">3M CO [ MMM ] - 10-K - Feb. 05, 2025</a></p></span></div>",
