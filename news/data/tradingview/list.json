Without predictable U.S. trade, Canada's economy needs other engines of growth other than housing, immigration and public-sector expansion, economists and business leaders argue.</p><p class=\"\">A survey from KPMG Canada late last month indicated that nearly half of the business leaders contacted said they plan to shift investments to the U.S. or set up production operations to secure tariff-free access to the U.S. market and reduce costs.</p><p class=\"\">Among those leading the call for a new Canadian economic vision is the chief executive of the country's largest bank. \"This is the moment to unite the country behind a long-term economic agenda-one that boosts competitiveness and drives prosperity for all,\" Dave McKay of Royal Bank of Canada said in a post on the social-networking site, LinkedIn. \"To do this, Canada must build a more resilient economy that leverages its strengths.\"</p><p class=\"\">Canadian policymakers might be listening. Canada's Liberal government decided last week to defer implementation, until 2026, of an increase in the country's capital-gains tax--a measure that business groups and executives criticized heavily as dissuading investment at an inopportune time.</p><p class=\"\">The Conservative Party, which holds a sizable lead in public-opinion polls, has vowed to scrap that tax, and pledged broadly to lower tax rates, cut the public sector and repeal environmental regulations that thwart the country's resource sector.</p><p class=\"\">Former Canadian and U.K. central banker Mark Carney, the perceived front-runner to succeed Justin Trudeau as prime minister and Liberal Party leader, is also signaling a shift in economic policy for the current governing party.</p><p class=\"\">\"The federal government spends too much, but it invests too little. Middle class taxes are too high,\" he said last month in announcing his bid to be Canada's next prime minister.</p><p class=\"\">Any tax cutting effort by Canada may further strain its public finances, with the budget deficit at historically elevated levels and debt-financing costs up 10% from a year ago, as of the third quarter of last year.</p><p class=\"\">Outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has often bragged Canada is the only Group of Seven country with free-trade agreements with all other G7 members. Economists say it's time to capitalize and diversify.</p><p class=\"\">\"There will, or should be in any event, a greater awareness in Canada that it does not have a trusted partner south of the border,\" said David Rosenberg, an economist and head of market-strategy firm Rosenberg Research.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com</p></span></div>",

The move keeps gold's positive momentum going, after it recorded net outflows in last week's trading, according to data from JPMorgan Global Commodities Research. The firm says that for the week ended Jan. 31, open interest in precious metals fell 4.6%, or by $11.3 billion. The firm attributes the decline to outflows in gold contracts, but uncertainty around trade tariffs is pushing investors back into the safe haven asset. Year-to-date, continuous gold futures have risen nearly 9%.

The aluminum-can maker has spent the better part of the last few weeks renegotiating deals with its Chinese aluminum suppliers in an attempt to mitigate a $40 million to $50 million issue, he says: \"I think we've got that resolved down to a couple million dollars.\" The larger concern now revolves around consumer sentiment. Consumers are already pretty stressed, Fisher says, adding that higher costs stemming from a 25% tariff would stifle demand and be a headwind to growth. Shares fall 8% after Ball reports a decline in 4Q sales and logs a loss. (connor.hart@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1149 ET - Base metal prices rise, with LME three-month copper up 0.5% at $9,158.50 a metric ton and LME three-month aluminum up 0.6% at $2,636.50 a ton. The market has bounced back from losses incurred by President Trump's proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which have been postponed a month after last-minute agreements on Monday. An additional 10% China tariff has proceeded. This has eased market worries of reduced industrial growth and demand. Canada and Mexico are significant suppliers to the U.S. across the whole base-metals complex, ranging from around 20% of copper imports to nearly half of its aluminum imports. News of the delay also sent the U.S. dollar lower, a tailwind for metals as it becomes cheaper for international buyers to purchase dollar-denominated commodities. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1141 ET - Gold futures rise, having set a fresh record slightly earlier in the session. Futures are up 0.5% at $2,871.60 a troy ounce, having peaked at $2,874.50 in European late afternoon trading. The precious metal has traded in a relatively narrow range, with rising U.S. bond yields and a stronger dollar limiting the upward rally, XS.com's Rania Gule says in a note. That said, concerns about potential economic fallout from President Trump's tariffs and other inflationary policies provide strong support for gold as a safe-haven asset, Gule writes. The overall upward trend for gold remains intact, and any corrective pullbacks should be seen as buying opportunities as supportive factors haven't fundamentally changed, Gule says. As markets remain uncertain, gold will likely stay a focus for investors both as a hedge and an investment opportunity, Gule adds.

Trump's decision to delay tariffs on his U.S. neighbors could reflect domestic backlash over potential economic pain for U.S. consumers but the same isn't necessarily true for the EU, he says. Trump can afford to keep EU tariffs in place for a prolonged period, making the bloc feel some pain before striking a deal. \"With all this in mind, we are somewhat sceptical that the euro is bound for a major rally.\" The euro rises 0.2% to $1.0364. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0956 ET - As the threat of U.S. tariffs on imports from Canada continues to loom, the ongoing uncertainty makes it challenging for small business owners to plan and make decisions on their operations, warns the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. The association, which represents about 100,000 members, said that as both countries catch their breath Canada still needs to focus on critical changes needed to prepare for the future. This, the federation suggests, means taking the opportunity now to bring in policies that improve the investment climate, reduce taxes, slash red tape and break down internal trade barriers in the country to ensure Canada is prepared no matter what external threats come its way. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)</p><p class=\"\">0952 ET - CBOT grain futures are mixed, with traders maintaining a reserved approach as China responds to Trump tariffs with retaliatory measures of its own targeting energy exports among other things. The tariffs make no mention of raw soybeans, but traders are wondering nonetheless about whether China will curb its purchases. \"Remember, we are looking to see if there is any new commodity buying by China, versus just 'maneuvering to avoid tariffs,\" says Naomi Blohm of Total Farm Marketing in a note. The USDA announced a new flash sale of corn to South Korea for 132,000 metric tons. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0940 ET - With tariffs paused but still looming, Canada's automotive industry continues to stress the integrated nature of the industry in North America and the damage levies could cause. The Canadian Automotive Partnership Council in a meeting with Canadian lawmakers warned tariffs pose an existential threat to the industry in Canada and the U.S. and costs ultimately being borne by consumers. The industry body notes bilateral automotive trade is balanced, with Canadian exports to the U.S. at C$82 billion and imports at C$79 billion in 2023. And it stresses Canadian-made vehicles don't pose a threat to U.S. automotive jobs or production mandates: fewer than 10% of vehicles sold in the U.S. are produced in Canada, whereas the U.S. assembles about half of the vehicles sold in Canada and exports more vehicles to Canada than to any other country.

(The Company)  today announced financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024.</p><p class=\"\">Net income for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $2.4 million ($1.00 per share), compared to $2.3 million ($0.94 per share) during the fourth quarter of 2023.  Net income was $10.4 million ($4.33 per share) for the twelve-month period ending December 31,Â 2024, compared to $10.0 million ($4.10 per share) during the same twelve-month period a year ago.</p><p class=\"\">Net interest income was $10.9 million during the quarter ended December 31,Â 2024, compared to $10.7 million in the same period of 2023, or a 2% increase.</p><p class=\"\">Non-interest income was $4.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of $0.2 million, or 5%, compared to $3.8 million during the quarter ended December 31,Â 2023.</p><p class=\"\">Non-interest expense was $11.9 million during the quarter ended December 31,Â 2024, compared to $11.6 million in the same period of 2023, an increase of $0.3 million, or 2.6%.</p><p class=\"\">Our investment portfolio consists entirely of debt securities classified as available-for-sale; therefore, unrealized gains and losses are fully reported on our balance sheet.  None of our securities are classified as held-to-maturity.  The investment portfolio decreased $31.1 million or 18% year over year and totaled $143.7 million at December 31,Â 2024.  The reduction of the securities portfolio in 2024 helped to reduce borrowings.</p><p class=\"\">Total loans slightly increased $1.6 million, or 0.1%, to $1.285 billion at December 31,Â 2024, from $1.284 billion at December 31,Â 2023. Nonperforming loans as a percent of total loans were 0.33% as of December 31,Â 2024, compared to 0.55% at December 31,Â 2023.</p><p class=\"\">The provision for credit loss had a provision of $0.1 million for the quarter ended December 31,Â 2024.  The allowance for credit loss ended at $14.4 million at December 31,Â 2024 and represented 1.12% of gross loans.  Asset quality continues to remain solid and charge offs remain low.</p><p class=\"\">Total deposits increased $26.6 million, or 2%, year-over-year. Approximately $49 million and $71 million consisted of brokered deposits at December 31,Â 2024 and 2023, respectively.  Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances were $67.9 million and $116 million at December 31,Â 2024 and 2023, respectively.</p><p class=\"\">The Company's capital levels remain solid as of December 31,Â 2024, with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.26%.</p><p class=\"\">On December 10,Â 2024, the Board of Directors declared a regular dividend of $0.25 per share, payable January 9,Â 2025, to shareholders of record on December 31,Â 2024.</p><p class=\"\">In announcing the results, Tri-County Financial Group, Inc. President and CEO Tim McConville, stated, \"Our fourth quarter numbers reflected solid earnings with slight improvement in margins, which can be attributed to the Federal Reserve easing short-term interest rates in the latter part of 2024 and the yield curve finally returning to a more normal state.  Despite the challenging economic environment for financial institutions for the majority of 2024, solid earnings performance existed as we remain attentive to our loan and deposit strategies.  We remain diligent in monitoring our local competition to offer competitive rates while continuing to provide exceptional community banking services.  Our loan portfolio continues to remain strong with minimal charge-offs and we believe that our diversified balance sheet and lines of business continue to be well-positioned. Asset quality as measured by nonperforming loans to total loans is stable as we continue to see solid performance with our borrowers.\"</p><p class=\"\">Tri-County Financial Group, Inc. is the parent holding company for First State Bank, with offices in Mendota, Batavia, Bloomington, Champaign, Geneva, LaMoille, McNabb, North Aurora, Ottawa, Peru, Princeton, Rochelle, Shabbona, St. Charles, Streator, Sycamore, Waterman and West Brooklyn.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics' Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report showed that job openings, a measure of labor demand, slid to 7.6 million on the last day of December. </p><p class=\"\">In afternoon trading, the benchmark 10-year yield was last down 2.8 basis points (bps) at 4.515% , after dropping on Monday to its lowest since mid-December.</p><p class=\"\">    \"I still think the 10-year yield could hit below 4% later this year, but that's really predicated on a slowing economy,\" said Gillum. \"If data continues to hold up, there's no reason that we can't trade between 4.50% to 5%.\"  </p><p class=\"\">    U.S. 30-year yields also slid to 4.751%, down 2 bps (US30YT=RR).  </p><p class=\"\">    On the short end of the curve, U.S. two-year yields, which are tied to the Federal Reserve's policy moves, fell 5.1 bps to 4.214% (US2YT=RR).</p><p class=\"\">Also helping push the two-year yield down was a report showing new orders for U.S.-manufactured goods dropped 0.9% in December after a revised 0.8% decline in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders would fall 0.7% after a previously reported 0.4% drop in November.</p><p class=\"\">The yield curve, meanwhile, flattened modestly on Tuesday, with the gap between two-year and 10-year yields at 29.7 bps (US2US10=TWEB), from 30.2 bps in the previous session. The curve hit its narrowest since late December on Monday after the initial tariff announcements.</p><p class=\"\">Investors have been selling the long end of the curve, demanding higher compensation, or the so-called \"term premium,\" in exchange for dealing with policy uncertainty over a longer time horizon. The current term premium for U.S. 10-year notes stood at 72 bps, according to estimates from the St. Louis Fed, compared with about 45 bps in early December.</p><p class=\"\">\"You expect yields to fall further, but that lack of clarity on policy is really giving intermediate and long-term investors more pause,\" said Chip Hughey, managing director of fixed income, at Truist Advisory Services in Richmond, Virginia.</p><p class=\"\">U.S. rate futures, meanwhile, have priced in about 46 bps of easing this year, or nearly two rate cuts of 25 bps each. That was up from 41 bps late on Monday, according to LSEG calculations, with the first rate cut likely happening at the Fed's June or July policy meeting.</p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:852.0000000000001px;aspect-ratio:1.4200000000000002\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3OV0WT-1b2c688746dc6282bf8dbbfb9333c3db-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt='A line chart titled \"US yield curve\" that tracks the metric over time.' class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3OV0WT-1b2c688746dc6282bf8dbbfb9333c3db-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#fafafb\"/></picture></div><figcaption class=\"caption-S5VA5POt\"><span class=\"copyright-S5VA5POt\">Thomson Reuters</span><span class=\"description-S5VA5POt\">US yield curve</span></figcaption></figure></span></p></span></div>",
