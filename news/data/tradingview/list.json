            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Bitcoin (BTC) has had a volatile 24 hours, plunging from $99,500 to as low as $91,231 amid mounting concerns over impending US trade tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. However, some crypto analysts see this sharp decline as a buying opportunity, suggesting that BTC may be oversold and poised for a rebound.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Is Bitcoin Poised For A Relief Rally?</strong></p><p class=\"\">Yesterday, the crypto market experienced one of its largest sell-offs in history, with over $2.3 billion in liquidations affecting more than 742,000 traders. This level of liquidations surpasses those seen during the COVID market crash in March 2020 and the FTX collapse in November 2022.</p><p class=\"\">Despite the downturn, some analysts argue that BTC may have entered oversold territory, signaling a potential relief rally. Crypto analyst Caleb Franzen shared insights in a post on X, highlighting that Bitcoin’s 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped into oversold levels. He noted:</p><div class=\"blockquote-xrkxvh37\"><p class=\"\">For the 5th time since August 2024, Bitcoin’s 4-hour RSI is becoming oversold. Each of the prior signals were attractive accumulation periods, even if price made new short-term lows after the signal flashed.</p></div><p class=\"\">For the uninitiated, the RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes to determine whether BTC is overbought or oversold. A reading above 70 suggests overbought conditions – potential for a pullback – while a reading below 30 indicates oversold conditions – potential for a rebound.</p><p class=\"\">According to Franzen’s chart, Bitcoin’s current RSI is hovering around 24 on the 4-hour timeframe, indicating that BTC may be in an attractive accumulation zone. If historical trends hold, BTC could be on the verge of a short-term recovery.</p><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:1007.9754601226994px;aspect-ratio:1.6799591002044991\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:39c979332094b-68a72e9f5874aed5d48ead63dcaff9f3-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"RSI\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:39c979332094b-68a72e9f5874aed5d48ead63dcaff9f3-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f1f3f1\"/></picture></div></figure></span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Is There More Trouble For BTC Ahead?</strong></p><p class=\"\">As of the latest updates, Donald Trump and his Mexican counterpart Claudia Sheinbaum have agreed to temporarily delay the proposed trade tariffs, offering some relief to financial markets. However, uncertainty remains regarding trade negotiations with Canada, leaving investors cautious about BTC’s next move.</p><p class=\"\">Meanwhile, fellow crypto analyst Johnny’s analysis indicates that “the meat” of BTC’s current down move is likely over. The analyst added that as long as BTC continues to trade above range lows and the yearly open, it will “look good compared to the rest of the market.”</p><p class=\"\">However, not all experts are optimistic. Renowned businessman and author Robert Kiyosaki warns that BTC could face further downside pressure if Trump follows through with his tariff plans. </p><p class=\"\">According to Kiyosaki, increased tariffs could strengthen the US dollar, potentially driving investors away from risk assets like Bitcoin in the short term. At press time, BTC trades at $98,644, up 0.4% in the past 24 hours.</p><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:811.3207547169811px;aspect-ratio:1.3522012578616351\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:39c979332094b-97cdcb541fe4c9a69b6dc79c30fc0c74-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"bitcoin\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:39c979332094b-97cdcb541fe4c9a69b6dc79c30fc0c74-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f8f8f8\"/></picture></div></figure></span></span></div>",

They reckon this is enough to tip the RBA's view to start supporting the economy a little earlier than expected. HSBC now sees the RBA cutting its cash rate by 25 bps this month, with another cut expected in 3Q and a final cut in the current cycle in 1Q 2026. (monica.gupta@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">    Missteps were inevitable in Japan’s fledgling M&amp;A trade as foreign investors and listed companies work out best practices. But the slow grind between U.S. private equity rivals KKR  and Bain Capital for Fuji Soft , a $4 billion IT firm with chunky real estate assets, is anathema to Tokyo’s desire for efficient value-creating deals. The longer it drags on, the more it risks damaging foreign investors' reputations. </p><p class=\"\">The last six months have seen a preponderance of left feet and crushed toes. The first surprise came from Bain in September, when it floated a non-binding offer, about 5% above a binding one from KKR of 8,880 yen per share. Bain cast itself as a white knight and conditioned its promises to firm up a bid on a recommendation from Fuji Soft’s board.</p><p class=\"\">Fuji Soft's special committee demurred and stuck by KKR, who took the unusual move of splitting its tender offer into two successive parts. That allowed it to snap up a 34% stake from activist investors including 3D Investment Partners, who first solicited buyout offers in 2023. </p><p class=\"\">The plan was perhaps too clever by half, however. KKR bagged enough shares to block any rival takeover but is left holding a minority stake in a publicly listed company, a position through which it can't add much value. KKR subsequently raised both parts of its offer to 9,451 yen. Nonetheless, unconvinced investors have forced the buyout firm to extend the second tender offer three times, with the latest ending on Feb. 7. KKR even asked Fuji Soft to file an injunction against Bain, which expects to launch its bid at 9,600 yen this month even without management's support. </p><p class=\"\">For now, the share price continues to hover above the offer prices but there is also a time value to money. Japanese regulators ought to consider how they can hasten M&amp;A proceedings and whether introducing something akin to the UK's \"put up or shut up rule\" might help to give targets more certainty. It was only a decade ago that foreign private equity groups were seen as vultures, and one protracted messy deal could be a setback for everybody. </p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:766.1870503597123px;aspect-ratio:1.276978417266187\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L3N3OO01L-fd17aa77b65b88d6761dc6044e3d9147-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"Line chart showing Fuji Soft share price and prices of binding offers from KKR and Bain\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L3N3OO01L-fd17aa77b65b88d6761dc6044e3d9147-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#fbfaf9\"/></picture></div><figcaption class=\"caption-S5VA5POt\"><span class=\"copyright-S5VA5POt\">Thomson Reuters</span><span class=\"description-S5VA5POt\">Fuji Soft buyout drama grows long in the tooth</span></figcaption></figure></span></p><p class=\"\">Follow @KangHexin on X</p><p class=\"\">CONTEXT NEWS</p><p class=\"\">U.S. private equity group KKR on Jan. 24 extended the deadline for the second stage of a tender offer to take control of Fuji Soft, a Japanese software services company. </p><p class=\"\">The extension until Feb. 7 was the third in just over a month and left KKR’s offer price unchanged at 9,451 yen per share, below the stock’s latest close of 9,800 yen.
