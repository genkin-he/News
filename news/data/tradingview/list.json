French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou pushed the 2025 budget bill without a vote by lawmakers, and faces a no-confidence vote. Using a constitutional tool to pass the bill \"was what led to fall of the previous French government,\" the fixed income research director says. \"Hence, there is still some considerable risks to being long France even at spread of some 75 basis points in the 10-year area to Germany,\" Sorensen says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0642 GMT - Higher tariffs have the potential to increase inflation in the short term if companies pass the costs on to their customers, says Damian McIntyre at Federated Hermes. However, this is unlikely to impact central bank policy in the longer term, says the head of multi-asset solutions in a note. \"We would expect this to be a one-off impact of inflation, rather than a sustained increase,\" he says. In the short term, this could keep rates higher for longer, he adds. Federated Hermes, however, does not expect it to have long-term implications for central bank policy. U.S. President Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Canada reached a deal to put tariffs on hold for a month. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0633 GMT - China's retaliation to Trump's tariffs doesn't seem aggressive, says Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. Beijing's measures only target some U.S. products, whereas the U.S. tariffs apply to all Chinese exports to the country, says Zhang. \"This is likely only the beginning of a long process for the two countries to negotiate,\" the economist says. The negotiations between the U.S. and its neighbors suggest that there is some hope of de-escalation at some point, though the road ahead is likely to be bumpy, Zhang says. Washington postponed tariffs on Canada and Mexico after reaching border-related deals.

These are now now playing out, potentially causing more volatility in rates markets, says Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy. \"This is likely a source for increased volatility in the rate market more so than serious disruption for companies and equities, but this is early days,\" he says in a note. U.S. President Trump moved to levy tariffs on Mexico and Canada, but the leaders of the three states reached an agreement to put tariffs on hold for a month. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0437 GMT - The real impact of U.S. tariffs is too early to determine, according to Stephen Dover, chief market strategist and head of the Franklin Templeton Institute, in a commentary. It is unclear whether these tariffs are a long-term policy or a negotiation tactic by President Trump to secure concessions, the strategist notes. At the margin, these tariffs should encourage more domestic production of goods in the United States. However, the uncertainty surrounding the permanence of these tariffs makes it challenging for companies to make informed capital investment decisions, Dover adds. Chinese policymakers and businesses are likely to implement measures to mitigate the impact should the situation escalate further, Dover notes. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0431 GMT - China could ramp up foreign direct investment in 2025 to ease the impact of higher U.S. tariffs on its exports and the broader economy, ANZ economists say in a research note. Chinese companies have invested heavily in third countries like Mexico since the initial U.S.-China trade dispute in 2018. According to China's commerce ministry, 326 Chinese enterprises registered to invest in Mexico in 2023, up from 133 in 2020. The economists think the trend is not only tariff driven, but also due to supply chain shifts. \"Low industrial profit under overcapacity concerns and relatively high production costs drives supply-chain shift overseas,\" they say. ANZ expects more overseas investment from Chinese companies to reduce reliance on traditional markets and diversify trade influence, they add. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0415 GMT - There are high hopes that China may strike a deal with President Trump to delay the additional 10% tariff, after Mexico and Canada managed to delay the U.S. tariffs, says IG. However, there is \"still room for surprises and Trump could still come down hard\", market strategist Yeap Jun Rong writes in a note. China is seen as a prominent threat to U.S. national security and economic competition, Yeap notes. The tech rivalry between the two countries has become even more pronounced recently with Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, he adds. \"But if China can pull it off, risk sentiments may find further recovery momentum, at least in the near term,\" Yeap says.(amanda.lee@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0410 GMT - Indonesia's economy is expected to have grown 4.89% in 4Q 2024, slightly easing from 3Q's 4.95%, according to the median estimate of six economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. Growth was likely supported by a modest uptick in demand, despite slower investment growth amid the transition to a new head of state, DBS economists Taimur Baig and Nathan Chow say in a note. The 4Q outcome would peg 2024 growth at an average of 5%, maintaining a steady pace from 2023, they add. Indonesia's 2023 GDP growth was 5.05%. The data is due Wednesday.

The U.S. tariffs on Mexico and Canada have been delayed for a month, so market participants are anticipating that Trump will do the same for China, Maybank analysts say in an FX Research &amp; Strategy report. \"Markets are now awaiting verdict on the last outstanding tariffs for China that could come into effect within hours,\" the analysts say. However, given recent choppy movements, the USD Index remains at the \"whims of tariff headlines,\" the analysts add. USD/SGD is 0.1% lower at 1.3591.

President Trump mentioned overnight that the U.S. might speak with China, likely within the next 24 hours, regarding tariffs, notes Mizuho Securities Asia's Ken Cheung in an email. Trump's comments revived hopes for a pause in U.S. tariffs on China, similar to the situation with Canada and Mexico, according to the director of FX Strategy. However, with mainland China still closed for holiday today, the USD/CNY fixing guidance on Wednesday will be closely monitored, Cheung adds. USD/CNH is little changed at 7.3114. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0339 GMT - Australia's core inflation remains high and the economy is fully employed, but global risks should make the Reserve Bank of Australia more dovish, say economists at HSBC Global Research. The escalation of trade tensions creates downside risk for the global economy and the scale and breadth of tariffs on products and countries suggest the impact is likely to be significant, say Paul Bloxham and Jamie Culling in a note. They reckon this is enough to tip the RBA's view to start supporting the economy a little earlier than expected. HSBC now sees the RBA cutting its cash rate by 25 bps this month, with another cut expected in 3Q and a final cut in the current cycle in 1Q 2026. (monica.gupta@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

Also, the Thailand bank will focus on growing retail loans that are primarily housing and credit-card loans in the high-income segment, the analyst notes.

Revenues were $242.2 million in 2024 compared to $244.4 million in 2023.</p><p class=\"\">EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $5.2 million compared to $7.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. EBITDA was $21.1 million in 2024 compared to $17.0 million in 2023.</p><p class=\"\">On a Non-GAAP basis, EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $8.5 million compared to $11.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023.

Net income was $15.3 million, or $0.50 per diluted share in 2024, compared to $8.8 million, or $0.28 per diluted share in 2023.</p><p class=\"\">On a Non-GAAP basis, net income was $11.6 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $8.9 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP net income was $27.3 million, or $0.87 per diluted share in 2024 compared to $25.0 million, or $0.77 per diluted share in 2023.</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP net income excludes: (i) share-based compensation expenses; (ii) amortization expenses related to intangible assets; (iii) expenses related to deferred payments in connection with the acquisition of Callverso Ltd; (iv) financial income (expenses) related to exchange rate differences in connection with revaluation of assets and liabilities in non-dollar denominated currencies; (v) tax impact which relates to our Non-GAAP adjustments; (vi) with respect to Q1 2024, non-cash lease expense which is required to be recorded during the quarter even though this is a free rent period under the lease for the Company's new headquarters; and (vii) a one-time, non-recurring settlement expense attributable to the Settlement Agreement (as defined below). A reconciliation of net income on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP basis is provided in the tables that accompany the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this press release.</p><p class=\"\">On December 25, 2024, we entered into a settlement (the \"Settlement Agreement\") with the landlord of our prior headquarters in connection with the termination of the related lease agreement. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, we incurred a one-time, non-recurring settlement expense of approximately $1.4 million during the quarterly period in the form of a cash payment made to the landlord.</p><p class=\"\">Net cash provided by operating activities was $15.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 and $35.3 million for 2024.</p><p class=\"\">Cash and cash equivalents, short-term bank deposits, long and short-term marketable securities and long-term financial investments were $93.9 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to $106.7 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents, short-term bank deposits, long and short-term marketable securities and long-term financial investments was the result of the use of cash for the continued repurchasing of the Company's ordinary shares pursuant to its share repurchase program, payment of a cash dividend during each of the first and third quarters of 2024, and the purchase of property and equipment related to leasehold improvements of our new corporate headquarters in Israel, offset, in part, by cash generated from operating activities.</p><p class=\"\">\"I am pleased to report solid fourth quarter performance, with healthy growth in key business lines, taking us further on our transformative evolution to a cloud software and services company,\" said Shabtai Adlersberg, President and Chief Executive Officer of AudioCodes.</p><p class=\"\">Enterprise UCaaS and CX business accounted for 92% of revenues in the fourth quarter, within which our UCaaS business performed well, highlighted by Microsoft business up 13% in the quarter, representing the highest quarterly growth rate this year.  Full year Microsoft business increased 6%, driven mainly by the ongoing transition of our revenue model from perpetual sales to recurrent revenue sales.  Live managed services mix within Microsoft business increased 30% year-over-year, and reached a level of 47% of business, compared to 40% in the year ago quarter.  This growth, coupled with 30% growth in Voice.ai business for the full year 2024, contributed to us ending 2024 with ARR at $65 million, representing 35% year-over-year growth.  We expect the recurring revenue business momentum to continue driving our sales for the UCaaS and CX markets in 2025 and beyond.  With the shift in focus for end customers towards Value-Added Services, we expect to see a rise in demand for our Voice.ai application solutions, and an increased interest in our Live Platform, which consolidates connectivity, management, and Value-Added Services through one integrated AudioCodes' platform.</p><p class=\"\">The significant investments we have in our Voice.ai and conversational AI portfolio over the last several years are paying off. Individual business units have emerged as leaders in their respective categories. Additionally, with growing customer demand for AI and Gen AI driven business voice applications and Value-added Services, we have seen a surge in our pipeline of created opportunities in Voice.ai connect, Voca CIC and Meeting Insights applications.  The growth in AI business applications is solid and we expect this segment to grow 40% to 50% in 2025.</p><p class=\"\">Overall, we exited 2024 with good operational momentum, particularly with the continued strong growth in our two primary engines, namely our Live family of managed services and Voice.ai. With the progress we are making in increasing our recurring revenues and the robust pipeline of opportunities, we expect to see improved top-line growth in 2025 and beyond,\" concluded Mr. Adlersberg.</p><p class=\"\">Share Buy Back Program</p><p class=\"\">During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the Company acquired 634,533 of its ordinary shares under its share repurchase program for a total consideration of $6.0 million.</p><p class=\"\">In December 2024, the Company received court approval in Israel to purchase up to an aggregate amount of $20 million of additional ordinary shares.
