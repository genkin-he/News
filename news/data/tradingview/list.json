            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Connor Hart</p><p class=\"\">Mattel is taking steps to limit the effects of President Trump's proposed tariffs, including relying on its global supply chain and potentially raising prices.</p><p class=\"\">The maker of Hot Wheels cars and Barbie dolls expects such measures to contribute to higher profits and revenue this year.</p><p class=\"\">Chief Executive Ynon Kreiz said that the company has spent years building out a supply chain that isn't overly reliant upon any one country, a structure that will play a critical role in navigating the looming trade war sparked by Trump's proposed tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China.</p><p class=\"\">\"We source product today from a mix of our own factories and third-party suppliers in seven different countries,\" he said Tuesday. \"This model is about having a diverse, flexible supply chain that is agile and can respond to different market conditions from different geographies.\"</p><p class=\"\">Mattel has said it plans to have no singular country account for more than a quarter of its total productions by 2027. Mexico accounts for less than 10% of the company's global production, and it produces less than 40% of its toys in China, whereas the industry average is around 80%, Kreiz said.</p><p class=\"\">The company will also consider increasing its prices, Kreiz said, planning to assess the market as the proposed tariffs play out and adapt accordingly.</p><p class=\"\">Companies have been scrambling to adjust their operations in the wake of the Trump administration's plans to impose tariffs. Automakers, for instance, have searched out new suppliers and have considered higher prices to offset the blow from looming tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports.</p><p class=\"\">Mattel's sales and profit forecast for the current year came in ahead of what analysts expected, according to FactSet. It also follows better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, during which Kreiz said the toy industry stabilized and U.S. consumers were in a good place.</p><p class=\"\">Shares of Mattel rose 7% in late trading to $19.33. Through Tuesday's close, the stock had been up 1.9% over the past year.</p><p class=\"\">The El Segundo, Calif.-based company reported a profit of $140.9 million, or 42 cents a share, in the recent quarter, compared with $147.3 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted per-share earnings came in at 35 cents, beating the 20 cents that analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting.</p><p class=\"\">Revenue increased 1.6% to $1.65 billion, just ahead of the $1.63 billion that analysts had forecast.</p><p class=\"\">Among its main brands, Barbie posted a 14% drop in gross billings, which measures sales to retailers before adjustments. The loss was offset by a 15% increase for Hot Wheels and a 3% raise for Fisher Price.</p><p class=\"\">Kreiz attributed Barbie's decline largely to last year's results having been inflated due to the blockbuster \"Barbie\" movie. He forecast continued momentum across the company's Hot Wheels brand in the current year, in part citing recent partnerships with Formula One and Ferrari.</p><p class=\"\">For 2025, Mattel expects net sales to grow 2% to 3%, which comes after sales fell 1.1% last year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet modeled revenue of $5.5 billion, representing a 2.3% increase from 2024.</p><p class=\"\">The company guided for adjusted per-share earnings between $1.66 and $1.72, ahead of the $1.57 that analysts are looking for.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Connor Hart at connor.hart@wsj.com</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Angela Palumbo</p><p class=\"\">Alphabet earnings beat Wall Street expectations, but revenue missed the mark.</p><p class=\"\">Alphabet reported fourth-quarter earnings of $2.15 a share on revenue of $96.47 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting the Google parent to post earnings of $2.13 a share on revenue of $96.68 billion.</p><p class=\"\">In the same period last year, Alphabet reported earnings of $1.64 a share on revenue of $86.3 billion.</p><p class=\"\">Cloud revenue in the quarter of $12 billion — a 30% increase from last year — just missed analyst estimates of $12.2 billion. This comes after Microsoft said on Jan. 29 that revenue in the second quarter from Azure and other cloud services increased by 31%, compared with 33% one quarter earlier.</p><p class=\"\">Youtube offered a bright spot for the company. Its advertising revenue of $10.47 billion beat estimates of $10.23 billion. Meta Platforms also reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter ad-revenue on Jan. 29.</p><p class=\"\">Similarly to fellow tech peers, Alphabet is spending significantly on generative artificial intelligence initiatives. The company reported capital expenditures in the quarter of $14.28 billion, above Wall Street's estimate of $13.26 billion and an increase from the $11 billion last year.</p><p class=\"\">CFO Anat Ashkenazi said on the company's earnings call that most of these investments were towards technical infrastructure, with the largest component being investments in servers and data centers.</p><p class=\"\">\"We are confident about the opportunities ahead, and to accelerate our progress, we expect to invest approximately $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2025,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said in the earnings release.</p><p class=\"\">Shares of Alphabet were down 7.9% in after-hours trading following the report.</p><p class=\"\">Massive spending on generative artificial intelligence has been a continuing theme. However, viral social-media posts last week said that DeepSeek had developed an AI model similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT for significantly less money than what U.S. tech companies have spent on AI. Experts have since decided the cost likely was higher than what has been reported, but there are still those who question whether tech giants need to keep spending as intensely as they have been.</p><p class=\"\">On top of clarification on the expected AI investments for next year, shareholders wanted to get updates about Alphabet's competitive stance. Google has remained king of search for years, but generative AI-powered chatbots have put its market share at risk. On top of ChatGPT and Meta AI, DeepSeek's chat model directly competes with Google's Gemini. Google announced Gemini 2.0 Flash in December, which has faster response times than its predecessor.</p><p class=\"\">When asked about his thoughts on the DeepSeek developments, Pichai said that while DeepSeek's team is \"tremendous,\" and doing \"very good work,\" Google's models \"are some of the most efficient models out there, including comparing to DeepSeek's V3 and R1.\"</p><p class=\"\">Looking ahead, investors are awaiting updates on the Department of Justice's antitrust case.</p><p class=\"\">A judge ruled in August that Google maintained a monopoly in general search services and general text advertising. The Justice Department has suggested a breakup of the company as a potential remedy.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

This capital infusion will support the continued development and expansion of NetraMark's AI solutions, designed to empower pharmaceutical companies with advanced insights for clinical trial success. The funding reinforces the company's ability to scale operations and drive innovation in precision medicine.</p><p class=\"\">Marketing, Public and Investor Relations</p><p class=\"\">NetraMark announces that it has extended the term of its original agreement (\"ARU Agreement\") with ARU Global Inc. (\"ARU\") to provide public relations services in an effort to increase public awareness of the Company. Certain services to be provided by ARU are anticipated to include \"investor relations activities\" under the policies of the Canadian Securities Exchange.  Any materials disseminated by ARU will require the prior written approval of the Company.</p><p class=\"\">The term of the ARU Agreement is extended to Mach 31, 2025. The ARU Agreement was also amended to increase compensation paid during the term to ARU, from $112,000 USD to $133,000 USD.  ARU is owned by Brian Uppal and is located at 17th Floor, PH Plaza 2000 50th Street Panama City, Panama and can be reached at 507-6532-8900 or brian@aruglobalinc.com. ARU does not have any interest, directly or indirectly, in NetraMark or its securities, or any right or intent to acquire such an interest.</p><p class=\"\">NetraMark also announces it has entered into an agreement with 1502656 B.C LTD. (\"BC Ltd.)\" to provide strategic digital media services, marketing (including awareness campaigns) and data analytical services to the Company (the \"Marketing Agreement\").

Unexplainable subsets are collections of patients that can lead to suboptimal overfit models and inaccurate insights due to poor correlations with the variables involved. The NetraAI uses the explainable subsets to derive insights and hypotheses (including factors that influence treatment and placebo responses, as well as adverse events) that have the potential to increase the chances of a clinical trial success.  Other AI methods lack these focus mechanisms and assign every patient to a class, even when this leads to \"overfitting\" which drowns out critical information that could have been used to improve a trial's chance of success.</p><p class=\"\">About NetraMark</p><p class=\"\">NetraMark is a company focused on being a leader in the development of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI)/Machine Learning (ML) solutions targeted at the Pharmaceutical industry. Its product offering uses a novel topology-based algorithm that has the ability to parse patient data sets into subsets of people that are strongly related according to several variables simultaneously. This allows NetraMark to use a variety of ML methods, depending on the character and size of the data, to transform the data into powerfully intelligent data that activates traditional AI/ML methods. The result is that NetraMark can work with much smaller datasets and accurately segment diseases into different types, as well as accurately classify patients for sensitivity to drugs and/or efficacy of treatment.</p><p class=\"\">For further details on the Company please see the Company's publicly available documents filed on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval+ (SEDAR+).</p><p class=\"\">Forward-Looking Statements</p><p class=\"\">This press release contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation including statements regarding the terms of ARU's engagement, the terms of BC Ltd.'s engagement, NetraMark's technology, benefits of new directors, officers, financial position and collaborations, the potential for accelerated growth and the potential value of our technology to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which are based upon NetraMark's current internal expectations, estimates, projections, assumptions and beliefs, and views of future events.

This initiative is part of PayPal's strategy to manage its credit products and liquidity needs effectively.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Capital Management:</strong> PayPal's capital management activities included repurchasing approximately $6.0 billion of its common stock in 2024 under the stock repurchase program authorized in June 2022. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $4.9 billion remained available for future repurchases. Additionally, PayPal maintains a $5.0 billion revolving credit facility, with no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2024, providing significant liquidity.
