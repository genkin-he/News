The NII was lower by 3.6%. Pre-Provision Operating Profits (PPOP) declined by 10.9% YoY (flat QoQ) in Q3FY25 to INR 36,007 Mn. The PPOP was a 2.6% miss compared to our estimates. The net profit for Q3FY25 stood at INR 14,023 Mn, a decline of 39.1% YoY (+5.3% QoQ). Near-term growth remains constrained by macroeconomic stress, elevated credit costs, and cautious lending in unsecured and microfinance segments, impacting margins and asset quality.</p><p class=\"\">Outlook</p><p class=\"\">We revise our Adjusted Book Value (ABV) downward by 4.3% for FY26E and 6.0% for FY27E, factoring in multiple stress points and a slower-than-anticipated recovery in the near to medium term. Rolling forward our valuation to FY27E, we assign a P/B multiple of 0.95x to the FY27E ABVPS of INR 1,084.8, leading to a revised target price of INR 1,031 (earlier INR 1,305).
