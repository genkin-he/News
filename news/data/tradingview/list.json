            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">BURLINGAME, Calif., Feb.  05, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — In an industry-defining moment, Accumulus Synergy (“Accumulus”) has powered Amgen’s groundbreaking regulatory submission: the first-ever, digitally generated Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) Post Approval Change (PAC) dossier, delivered to the Reference Country and nearly two dozen participating Reliance countries, simultaneously. This transformative achievement aims to redefine the regulatory landscape by accelerating global approvals while setting a new benchmark for transparency and efficiency.</p><p class=\"\">Leveraging the Accumulus platform, the digitally generated dossier created by Amgen using its proprietary AI and novel Structured Content and Data Management (SCDM) software is being reviewed by the Reliance Reference Country and all participating regulators at the same time. This means that every jurisdiction involved has real-time access to all regulatory information, from submission details to ongoing questions, answers, and updates, as it becomes available. This transparency not only has the potential to accelerate review timelines but also to pave the way for a fully digital regulatory ecosystem.</p><p class=\"\">“For the first time ever, sponsors are able to submit a single, digital, global dossier to multiple regulators around the world with just a click of a button,” said Francisco Nogueira, CEO of Accumulus. “The Accumulus platform isn’t just a technological advancement, it’s a reimagining of regulatory processes which could ultimately lead to patients receiving the treatments they need sooner.”</p><p class=\"\">With this submission, Accumulus and Amgen have taken a crucial first step in redefining the Reliance concept. Unlike conventional Reliance projects where regulators must wait for the Reference Country’s completed review to gain access to critical data, Amgen is utilizing the Accumulus platform to democratize information in real-time to all participating regulators, equipping all stakeholders with the same information at the same time.</p><p class=\"\">Leveraging the Accumulus platform’s cutting-edge digital innovation and the transformative power of Reliance pathways, Accumulus and Amgen are working to minimize CMC variances caused by lengthy registration timelines and diverging regulatory requirements, addressing one of the most persistent challenges in global regulatory filings. This approach aims to realize more efficient review and approval timelines, the return of facility capacity to sponsors, and accelerated access of medicines to patients globally.</p><p class=\"\">“As a company dedicated to innovation, this is a proud moment for Amgen. Simultaneous regulatory submissions through the cloud could lead to faster reviews, approvals, and accelerated access to medicines for patients who need new treatment solutions,” said Mark Taisey, Senior Vice President Global Regulatory Affairs, Amgen. “Using Amgen’s proprietary AI and SCDM software, we are looking forward to the next step in the industry’s digital evolution. By moving to cloud-based digital dossiers, we’re unlocking the true potential of digital transformation in regulatory collaboration. Democratized access to information ensures that every country, regardless of its role in the Reliance process, has the tools and data needed to drive faster decisions.”</p><p class=\"\">“As Accumulus continues to lead the charge in global regulatory transformation, it remains committed to creating a faster, more transparent, and collaborative future,” added Nogueira. “We’re not just talking about the future of regulatory submissions; we’re actively creating it. Our Platform is reshaping how information is shared, how regulators and industry collaborate, and how approval timelines are accelerated, all with an unwavering commitment to the highest standards of compliance and security.”</p><p class=\"\">About Accumulus Synergy</p><p class=\"\">Accumulus Synergy is a global, nonprofit industry association developing a transformative data exchange platform that aims to enable enhanced collaboration and efficiency between life sciences organizations and global Regulatory Authorities while also affording users the ability to extract dynamic, data-driven insights. Accumulus is working with key stakeholders in the life sciences – regulatory ecosystem to build and sustain a platform that aims to meet regulatory, cybersecurity, and privacy requirements spanning clinical, safety, chemistry, and manufacturing and regulatory exchanges and submissions. Accumulus Synergy Sponsors include leading global pharmaceutical companies.</p><p class=\"\">Media Contact</p><p class=\"\">E: allison.mari@accumulus.org</p><p class=\"\">P: 540-907-6053</p></span></div>",

This collaboration will highlight Coach Harbaugh in live and social media initiatives.</p><p class=\"\">Even nearly five years after the start of the pandemic, COVID-19 is causing an American death approximately every 9 minutes,1 and, in 2024, caused approximately 59,000 deaths,2 665,000 hospitalizations,2 and growing burden of Long COVID over time, despite broadly available and utilized vaccine boosts and small molecule therapy. In addition, the percentage of COVID-19 associated hospitalizations with intensive care unit (ICU) admissions is once again on the rise.3 A recent article published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases4 discusses how the current health and economic burden of the long-term impacts of COVID-19 may already exceed several other chronic diseases and will persist as COVID-19 cases continue to rise. This could be a significant drain not only on patients, but also on businesses, third party payers, healthcare systems, and all of society.</p><p class=\"\">“As a long-time coach, I want players on the field, fans in the stands, and friends and family gathering to enjoy the game. But, COVID-19 has and continues to sideline many people,” said Coach Harbaugh. “While COVID-19 may seem like old news to some, many Americans continue to get sick, are hospitalized, and are dying from COVID-19, despite many of us having been vaccinated. The extent of damage to our bodies in the long-term is still unknown. The good news is for many there are options other than vaccines and people are encouraged to visit www.expandtheiroptions.com to learn more.”</p><p class=\"\">“We are thrilled to have Coach Harbaugh on our team as we work to educate healthcare providers as well as the millions of immunocompromised people we serve about the continued prevalence and significant risks of COVID-19, which is common, but not a cold,” noted Julie Green, Invivyd’s Chief Human Resources Officer and Head of Communications. “We are grateful to Coach Harbaugh for his passion to raise awareness about the ongoing prevalence and impact of COVID-19 and his determination for people to seek options that may help them find ways to safely enjoy activities they love, like watching the big game with family and friends.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Invivyd</strong></p><p class=\"\">Invivyd, Inc.  is a biopharmaceutical company devoted to delivering protection from serious viral infectious diseases, beginning with SARS-CoV-2.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Freemelt has received an order from UKAEA (United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority) to conduct production scalability tests of 3D printed tungsten tiles for fusion energy power plants, strengthening Freemelt’s position in the energy sector. The order value is approximately SEK 0.7 million with expected delivery during the first quarter of 2025.</p><p class=\"\">This project is a continuation of previous feasibility studies that Freemelt has performed in collaboration with UKAEA. The proof-of-concept project target to demonstrate volume production using Freemelt’s E-PBF (Electron Beam Powder Bed Fusion) technology and industrial machine, eMELT.</p><p class=\"\">Freemelt and UKAEA have been collaborating since April 2023 and has previously carried out two feasibility studies, the first focused on process development, and the second focused on application testing. In this new project Freemelt will demonstrate production scalability of tungsten tiles, a critical step in validating the potential for future volume production. As part of this study the repeatability of the E-PBF process will be evaluated to support component qualification programmes for potential use in next generation fusion energy power plants. Fusion energy has great potential as energy source, and during the coming years, large experimental tokamaks* and fusion power plants will require significant volumes of advanced components.</p><p class=\"\">“The fact that we now advance the collaboration to volume production tests of tungsten tiles is an important confirmation that our E-PBF technology meets the demanding requirements in fusion energy. Tungsten is one of the most challenging materials to process, and our technology enables the production of complex components with high quality. This is an opportunity to further strengthen our position in the energy sector,\" says Daniel Gidlund, CEO of Freemelt.</p><p class=\"\">Fusion has the potential to revolutionize the energy sector. Unlike today’s nuclear power, which relies on fission (nuclear splitting), fusion does not produce long-lived radioactive waste. However, for the process to succeed, extremely high temperatures and advanced materials that can withstand the harsh conditions of the fusion environment are essential.</p><p class=\"\">Recent advancements in fusion, both internationally and through Swedish companies like Novatron, have increased the interest in the technology. Total investment in the energy sector is expected to rise from USD 300 billion in 2024 to USD 500 billion by 2030, corresponding to an annual growth rate of 7.4%. In the fusion sector, investments reached USD 7.1 billion in 2024, driven by large-scale research projects and increased private investments from companies such as Commonwealth Fusion.</p><p class=\"\">Test fusion machines like experimental tokamaks are essential for validating fusion technology before scaling to commercial electricity production. They require millions of tungsten components. ITER, the world’s largest experimental tokamak, is predicted to need between 1 and 1.5 million tungsten tiles, while smaller power plants under development by Tokamak Energy will require about 10 percent of ITER’s volume.</p><p class=\"\">UKAEA is the UK’s national organisation responsible for fusion energy development and commercialisation, driving several advanced research projects to commercialise fusion as a safe, sustainable, and emissions-free energy source. Through collaborations with industry and academia, UKAEA is driving the development of new materials and manufacturing methods required for future fusion power plants.</p><p class=\"\">*The tokamak is an experimental fusion reactor designed to harness the energy of fusion</p></span></div>",

The Kors brand added too much fashion, alienating core customers. Versace removed too many unique statement items and reduced the number of lower-priced products. Idol says Kors will refocus on its heritage and plans to add a more balanced mix of products, while reducing some prices to be more in line with historical levels. Versace will add more products at the lower end of its price range to appeal to a broader base of consumers. (suzanne.kepner@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Standard Chartered's Geoffrey Kendrick has a bold long-term forecast for bitcoin, predicting that the cryptocurrency will reach $500,000 by 2028. He attributes this potential rise to two key factors: growing investor access and declining volatility.</p><p class=\"\">\"Access is improving under the [Donald] Trump administration,\" Kendrick, Standard Chartered's global head of digital assets research, told The Block in an email Wednesday. \"Institutional inflows will continue to gather pace. And vol will gradually come lower as the quality of flows improves and other infrastructure (eg. options markets) expand.\"</p><p class=\"\">These potential factors are \"enough to drive Bitcoin to $500,000 before Trump leaves office,\" Kendrick said.</p><p class=\"\">Bitcoin is currently trading at about $98,700, according to The Block's bitcoin price page.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Increasing investor access and decreasing volatility</strong></p><p class=\"\">Kendrick noted in a new report Wednesday that the launch of U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 has significantly expanded investor access, bringing in $39 billion in net inflows so far. He expects bitcoin's volatility to decline as the ETF market matures and as financial infrastructure improves — particularly with the expansion of options markets and institutional counterparties.</p><p class=\"\">Gold provides a useful comparison, Kendrick said, pointing to how its price surged 4.3 times after exchange-traded products (ETPs) were introduced in 2004. He expects bitcoin ETFs to follow a similar path but within two years instead of seven.</p><p class=\"\">\"As vol falls, Bitcoin's share of an optimized two-asset portfolio with gold increases,\" Kendrick said. \"Investor access and lower vol should lead to price appreciation longer-term as portfolios continue to move towards their optimal/logical state.\"</p><p class=\"\">Beyond the maturing ETF market, Kendrick sees further improvements under the Trump administration, particularly after the repeal of SAB 121, which lifted accounting restrictions for companies holding digital assets. He also pointed to Trump's executive order to evaluate a national digital asset stockpile, suggesting it could encourage central banks to consider bitcoin investments.</p><p class=\"\">“Given these developments, which are in line with our previous expectations, we continue to target BTC to reach the $200,000 level by year-end 2025. Thereafter, we see BTC reaching levels around $300,000 by end-2026, $400,000 by end-2027 and $500,000 by end-2028, remaining there until end-2029,” Kendrick concluded.</p><p class=\"\">Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

That puts some upside risk to the flash estimate GDP rebounded by only a modest 0.2% on-month in December after contracting 0.2% in November, he says.

America's trade in goods and services with the rest of the world showed a sharply increased deficit in December to just shy of $100 billion, according to Commerce Department figures set out Wednesday. Imports rose and exports declined. \"The strength of imports appears largely driven by businesses rushing orders ahead of potential tariffs, a trend unlikely to reverse any time soon,\" Ryan tells investors in a note.(joshua.kirby@wsj.com; @joshualeokirby)</p><p class=\"\">0901 ET - Euro-denominated investment-grade bonds appear attractive due to strong demand and since the issuers are in good financial health, analysts at Amundi Investment Institute say in a note. \"We favor euro financials and subordinated debt, and investment-grade bonds over high-yield bonds,\" Amundi says. The analysts are cautious on bonds with lower ratings like triple C bonds. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0901 ET - ADP's employment estimate indicates solid U.S. job growth in January. The payroll and HR-services provider figures that the economy added 183,000 jobs last month. It also sharply revises up its December estimate: now to 176,000, from 122,000 previously. Carl Weinberg and Mary Chen of High Frequency Economics warn that the ADP figure isn't a stellar predictor of official data, but say adds useful color. \"Right now, [the big picture] is one of still substantial increases in jobs by a fast-growing economy but a slowing trend in job creation,\" they write. \"Today's figures do not upset that trend.\" (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)</p><p class=\"\">0857 ET - Gold futures rise, keeping close to a fresh record set earlier in the session. Futures rise 0.2% to $2,880.80 a troy ounce, having hit $2,901.50 earlier in the day. Investors are increasingly seeking safe-haven in hard assets like gold, silver, copper and platinum, historically viewed as stores of value in times of financial uncertainty, Saxo Bank's Ole Hansen says in a note. The risk of sovereign debt crises, currency devaluations and systemic financial instability could further reinforce this trend, increasing the attractiveness of metals as a hedge against economic turbulence, Hansen writes. A shift away from U.S. dollar dominance is also underway as nations seek to reduce their greenback reliance for trade and reserve holdings, Hansen says. This is further supporting demand for gold and other stable commodities, as countries seek alternative to fiat currencies, he adds. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0857 ET - Goldman Sachs economists think the risks of tariff escalation remain very real. The bank's team now projects that the U.S. will enact a 10% global tariff on critical imports such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals as its baseline forecast, as well as a tariff on cars from the EU. If its current expected scenario is implemented, the tariffs could erase most progress on inflation otherwise expected this year, leaving core PCE inflation at 2.6% over the 12 months through December, Goldman projects. If Canada and Mexico tariffs are implemented after all, inflation would instead increase, peaking just above 3%, Goldman writes.

The decision to leave rates unchanged was almost completely priced in by the market but the central bank's restrictive policy stance over the past year is a key factor underpinning the zloty's strength, Capital Economics economist Nicholas Farr says. The NBP kept rates steady throughout 2024 and looks unlikely to cut rates in 2025 given the risk of higher inflation, he says. EUR/PLN last trades at 4.1991 after briefly falling to a low of 4.1931 after the decision from 4.1961 beforehand.

Meanwhile, U.S. trade deficit widens to $98.4 billion in December from November's revised $78.9 billion and versus a forecast of $96.8 billion in a WSJ survey.

Japanese wage growth data overnight was stronger than expected and BOJ former executive director Hideo Hayakawa told Bloomberg rates could rise more than markets predict. The summary of policymakers' opinions at the January BOJ meeting also signalled further rate rises. Rabobank retains a medium-term USD/JPY forecast of 145.00. USD/JPY falls 0.9% to 152.908, having earlier reached a near eight-week low of 152.555, according to FactSet.(renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0812 ET - European fixed income markets offer better value than bond markets in the U.S., given the high risk of inflation in the latter, Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management's Benjamin Melman says in a note. \"The global inflation no longer appears to be retreating, notably in the U.S., due to uncertainties surrounding the Trump administration's programme,\" the global chief investment officer says. In fixed income markets, there is more value to be found in Europe, on account of the much higher risks on inflation forecasts in the U.S., he says. Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management has a preference for 'carry' strategies in the current environment, as the yields on money market instruments are expected to fall this year, he says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0743 ET - The Bank of England is expected to cut interest rates on Thursday and it could signal another rate cut in March, Peel Hunt's Kallum Pickering says in a note. The BOE is likely to keep monetary policy guidance unchanged with one-per-quarter interest rate cut, Pickering says. \"However, risks are skewed towards policymakers signaling a willingness to react more forcefully to economic weakness,\" he says. Markets expect a total of 84 basis points of BOE interest rate cuts in 2025, LSEG Refinitiv data show. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

Stewart</p><p class=\"\">OTTAWA--Canada swung to a global trade surplus for the first time in 10 months at the end of last year as the local currency continued to weaken and energy shipments to the U.S. rose.</p><p class=\"\">The country posted a merchandise-trade surplus in December of 708 million Canadian dollars, the equivalent of about $494.3 million, Statistics Canada said Wednesday. That was narrower than the C$1.03 billion surplus expected by economists and comes after November's deficit was revised upward by C$663 million to C$986 million.</p><p class=\"\">The shift for the month still left Canada with a deficit with the world of about C$7.2 billion, much wider than the C$610 million shortfall the year before.</p><p class=\"\">The country's merchandise exports in December increased 4.9% to C$69.46 billion, while imports rose 2.3% to C$68.76 billion, the data agency said. For the year, imports advanced 1.9% to outpace a 1.0% lift in global exports.</p><p class=\"\">Economic growth in Canada picked up over the final quarter of last year following a string of interest rate cuts by the central bank since June as inflation has cooled. There remains a great deal of uncertainty over what 2025 will bring as the country braces for possible U.S. tariffs on imports from Canada.</p><p class=\"\">The rise in exports in December was the largest since last February, though the growth was due in part to the sharp depreciation of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar for a third month running, given a large portion of trade is completed in the U.S. currency. In volume terms, exports for the month were up 2.6% from November.</p><p class=\"\">Exports of energy products jumped 9.5% from the month before, with a rise in the value of crude oil. Exports of mineral products also rose strongly, and Canada shipped more motor vehicles and parts, as well as farm, fishing and intermediate food products for the month.</p><p class=\"\">In preparation for President Trump's threatened levies, some businesses accelerated shipments. A KPMG survey of 250 business leaders across Canada last month found 65% preemptively shipped goods or products ahead of Trump's inauguration and almost half have plans to shift investment and would set up operations or production south of the border to serve the U.S. market and reduce costs.</p><p class=\"\">Trump on Monday struck last-minute deals to delay by one month plans to levy hefty tariffs on Canada to see if in that time an \"economic deal\" with Canada can be structured. Trump has repeatedly complained about America's trade deficit with its northern neighbor.</p><p class=\"\">Statistics Canada's data showed Canada's long-standing surplus with the U.S. narrowed slightly last year to roughly C$102.2 billion from C$108.3 billion in 2023. Cross-border trade between the two countries topped the C$1 trillion mark for a third consecutive year in 2024, with the U.S. the destination for almost 76% of all exports and the source for some 62% of overall imports.</p><p class=\"\">Energy products remain the key to Canada's surplus with its neighbor. The country exported about C$176.2 billion of energy last year, roughly 88% of which went to the U.S.</p><p class=\"\">For December, Canada's exports to the U.S. were up 5.0% following a 6.7% rise the month before. The same month, imports of U.S. goods fell 1.5%, which widened the trade surplus between the countries to C$11.34 billion from C$8.19 billion in November.</p><p class=\"\">That came as Canada's deficit with countries other than the U.S. widened to roughly C$10.6 billion in December from C$9.2 billion the month before.</p><p class=\"\">When international trade in goods and international trade in services were combined, Canadian exports rose 4.1% in December, while imports increased 1.6%. As a result, Canada's trade incorporating both goods and services swung to a surplus of C$641 million in December from a C$1.43 billion deficit the month before.</p><p class=\"\">Combining both services and goods traded with the U.S. over the last year, and Canada recorded an overall trade surplus of about C$94.4 billion with its neighbor.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Robb M.
