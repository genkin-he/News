            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Vancouver, BC, Feb.  05, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — <!-- -->American Tungsten Corp.  (OTCQB:DEMRF) (FSE:RK9) (“<strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">American Tungsten</strong>” or the “<strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Company</strong>”) announces that it has completed initial compilation and assessment of historical drillhole information from Gentor Resources, Inc. (“<strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Gentor</strong>”). Gentor drilled 13 holes on the IMA Mine property in 2007 and 2008 totalling 22,088 feet. Information from the historical drilling program is well documented by digital and printed records and existing drill core. </p><p class=\"\">“Historical drilling and exploration work on the property is a significant asset to the IMA tungsten project,” said Murray Nye, CEO American Tungsten Corp. “We are pleased with our review of the Gentor data and believe it can be comprehensively validated and used to support future reports and studies.”</p><p class=\"\">The IMA Mine is a past producing underground tungsten mine situated on 22 patented claims located in East Central Idaho. Between 1945 and 1957, the property produced approximately 199,449 MTUs of WO3 and was subsequently explored for molybdenum and tungsten by various operators between 1960-2008(1). </p><p class=\"\">Records from Gentor’s 2007-2008 drilling program consist of drilllogs, ½ sawn drillcore, survey and sample records, assay certificates and QA-QC data. American Tungsten compiled the Gentor drilling records and assay data obtained directly from the assay lab into an electronic database and completed initial verifications and validations. Significant tungsten intercepts in historical drillcore were also reviewed by American Tungsten geology staff and independent QPs while on-site January 14-16th, 2025. </p><p class=\"\">Gentor explored the IMA Mine in 2007 and 2008, principally for molybdenum. However, drilling intersected significant tungsten as well. In addition to historical molybdenum intercepts, significant tungsten intercepts in quartz veins, as previously reported by Gentor, include:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Hole IMA-21: 20.5 feet grading .058% MoS(2), .394% W, 1 oz/ton Ag, .111% Cu (copper), .416% Pb (lead) and .106% Zn (zinc) from 336 feet to 356.5 feet.(2,4)</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">and 9.5 feet grading .326% W, .96 oz/ton Ag, .145%Cu, .263% Pb, and .328% Zn from 1212.4 to 1221.9 feet. (2,4)</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Hole IMA-23A: 10 feet grading 1.448% MoS2, .583% W, 4.22 oz/ton Ag, .264% Cu from (1400 ft – 1410 ft). (3,4)</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Hole IMA-24: 7.1 feet grading .021% MoS2, .483% W, 1.03 oz/ton Ag, .079% cu and .361% Zn from 661 feet to 668.1 feet. (3,4)</li></ul><p class=\"\">In addition to those reported historically, American Tungsten has identified numerous significant additional vein intercepts in legacy drilling data sets and plans to undertake a comprehensive verification program to validate the results. Neither American Tungsten, nor its Qualified Person, has done sufficient work to verify historical drillhole information. American Tungsten is not treating the historical drillhole information as current drilling results. Historical drillhole results are believed to be substantially factual and relevant in that they demonstrate the tenor of exploration targets on the property. </p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">ABOUT AMERICAN TUNGSTEN CORP.</strong></p><p class=\"\">American Tungsten Corp.
