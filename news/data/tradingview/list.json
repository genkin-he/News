The owner of Johnnie Walker, Guinness and Smirnoff reported a positive performance for the first half, ahead of market expectations. Meanwhile, full-year guidance reflects a sequential increase in organic sales growth and a slight decline in organic EBIT, the analysts write in a note. The guidance removal is welcome as it led to unrealistic investor expectations and sub-optimal management decisions designed to support an unfeasible growth aspiration. The target has been replaced by more comprehensive short-term guidance with the promise of improved productivity efforts and tighter capital discipline, they say. Shares are down 2.7% and nearly 20% over the 52-week period. (michael.susin@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">Diageo's Performance Seen as Positive, Guidance Withdraw Acceptable</p><p class=\"\">0853 GMT - Diageo's 1H performance was satisfactory and likely exceeded market expectations, with signs of stabilization as sales were up by 1% and profits down by 1%, Quilter Cheviot's Chris Beckett says. Diageo's decision to remove medium-term guidance of 5%-7% organic sales growth might upset some investors. However, this move is acceptable given that the target was laid during the pandemic--when demand for alcohol was exceptionally high--and unrealistic given the current environment, Beckett writes in a note. Additionally, the owner of Johnnie Walker, Guinness and Smirnoff seems to be effectively managing its significant debt, given that the dividend remained unchanged amid concerns of a potential cut, Beckett says. Diageo's 2H performance is likely to be similar if U.S. tariffs are not imposed, he adds. Shares are down 3.3% and nearly 20% over the last 52 weeks. (michael.susin@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">Diageo's Results Show Progress But U.S. Tariffs Remain a Question Mark</p><p class=\"\">0958 GMT - Diageo's first-half results show consistent progress, mostly in line with the company's guidance and market expectations, but uncertainty remains in the U.S., Stifel analyst Cedric Lecasble says in a research note. The U.K. spirits maker booked net sales of $10.90 billion in the six months to Dec. 31, up 1% organically on year. \"Meeting expectations in this dull environment is an already solid performance, but U.S. tariffs remain the main question mark,\" he says. The analyst welcomed the group's decision to withdraw its medium-term outlook of organic net sales growth between 5% and 7%, as the target seemed more and more challenging in the current environment. Shares are down 3.7% at 22.78 pounds. (andrea.figueras@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">Diageo's Prospects Are a Glass Half Empty</p><p class=\"\">1041 GMT - Diageo faces a testing time, and its challenges are leading to a pessimistic outlook, says Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor. The U.K. distiller withdrew its midterm guidance of organic net sales growth between 5% and 7%. It also said it had expected to build on the momentum seen during the first half, but that the application of tariffs in the U.S. could affect this goal. The fact that Diageo imports an estimated 40% of its products for sale in the U.S. from Mexico and Canada is a significant overhang, Hunter says in a note. The products that are most affected by tariffs are tequila and Canadian whisky, which could leave the group with little option but to hike prices at a time when discretionary spend is under pressure, he says. Shares are down 0.7% at 23.48 pounds. (andrea.figueras@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">Diageo Starts 2025 on Back Foot, AJ Bell Says</p><p class=\"\">1334 GMT - Diageo has had little to toast so far in 2025, AJ Bell's Russ Mould says in a note. First the calls from U.S. surgeon general for warnings about the health impacts of alcohol consumption and now it has withdrawn its medium-term guidance. The Guinness beer owner scrapped its midterm outlook of organic net sales growth of between 5% and 7%, citing uncertainty in key markets. The company said U.S. tariffs would affect the Mexican tequila and Canadian whisky it sells in the U.S. AJ Bell's investment director says the group will be relieved to see the imposition of tariffs for these two countries delayed for now, as imports from these countries account for a good chunk of Diageo's U.S. sales. Shares are down 0.7% at 23.49 pounds. (andrea.figueras@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

The report reveals that while 87% of industry leaders are shifting toward automated revenue management operations, nearly 60% still rely on multiple solutions. Additionally, 62% are using or planning to implement generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) for revenue optimization activities, including deal analytics, process automation, and forecasting. </p><p class=\"\">This gap between automation goals and system integration presents both a challenge and an opportunity. The research found that companies with more than 10,000 employees are 51% more likely than smaller organizations to use a unified revenue management solution.  </p><p class=\"\">“Life sciences and high-tech manufacturers are using advanced technologies to automate and optimize revenue operations with data-driven insights,” said Suresh Kannan, Model N Chief Product Officer. “This year’s State of Revenue Report highlights the value of integrating GenAI for revenue management and transitioning to a unified solution. By harnessing AI and consolidating platforms, organizations can unlock greater revenue optimization opportunities, boost efficiency, and drive growth.” </p><p class=\"\">Life Sciences Executives Focus on Regulatory Readiness and AI Adoption </p><p class=\"\">Pharmaceutical companies are modernizing their revenue management approach to navigate a complex regulatory landscape. Pricing strategy is pharmaceutical leaders’ highest priority for revenue management-related strategic investment over the next two years. Eighty-seven percent of leaders report that they have already adjusted their launch plans in response to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).</p><p class=\"\">State-level regulations like price transparency mandates and affordability boards are also a significant focus, with 76% of leaders concerned about how the regulatory changes may impact revenue management. Automation and technology, including GenAI, are key enablers, with 62% of pharmaceutical companies using or planning to use GenAI to strengthen revenue operations. </p><p class=\"\">The medtech sector is undergoing a similar transformation. Regulatory changes like healthcare price transparency (45%) and the European Union’s implementation of the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) (40%) top the list of impacts on revenue programs. Nearly two-thirds of medtech companies are already seeing shifts as AI and automation are integrated into healthcare operations, and leaders are beginning to incorporate these approaches into their own company’s revenue optimization and compliance processes. Looking ahead, 38% of leaders are focusing on adapting to value-based care models, expecting further impacts on revenue optimization functions. </p><p class=\"\">High-Tech Manufacturers Strengthen Channel Intelligence</p><p class=\"\">High-tech companies are advancing their use of channel data – in fact, 87% regularly use channel sales data to inform price management and optimization processes. This industry leads in applying new technology to business processes, with 74% of high-tech manufacturers planning to implement GenAI solutions – the highest rate across industries surveyed in the State of Revenue Report.</p><p class=\"\">Supply chain disruption continues to influence strategy, prompting 53% of companies to diversify suppliers, 51% to deploy new technologies, and half to implement sustainability initiatives. Additionally, 95% of high-tech leaders express concerns about grey market sales, implementing measures such as removing unauthorized sellers and enhanced contract enforcement.</p><p class=\"\">For more specific information about revenue optimization in life sciences and high-tech, download the full 2025 State of Revenue Report.</p><p class=\"\">###</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">More About the 2025 State of Revenue Report</strong></p><p class=\"\">This report, commissioned by Model N with research conducted by Dimensional Research, is based on the results of a survey of more than 400 strategy and finance, operations, and technology leaders who are directly responsible for revenue management at large pharmaceutical, medical technology, high-tech, or semiconductor and electronic component manufacturers. </p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Model N</strong></p><p class=\"\">Model N is the leader in revenue optimization and compliance for pharmaceutical, medtech and high-tech innovators.

Recipients leverage their talents and resources to elevate the standard of excellence in health care available to our nation’s Veterans.</p><p class=\"\">LTG (Ret) Patricia “Patty” D. Horoho was the 43rd United States Army Surgeon General and the Commander of the U.S. Army Medical Command. She made history as the first woman, first nurse and non-physician to hold these posts. In these roles, General Horoho led the world’s third-largest health care system with a multi-billion-dollar budget, a staff of 156,000 and a global logistics, research and care network that spanned five continents.</p><p class=\"\">In 2017, she was chosen to establish and lead Optum Serve, the end-to-end federal business of both Optum and UnitedHealth Group. Her role has expanded to include leading Optum Health Solutions, and she was later appointed as Chief Strategy, Innovation and Transformation Officer for Optum Health.</p><p class=\"\">She established the 2Serve Together Foundation in 2023, a nonprofit dedicated to empowering and recognizing military women by providing them with opportunities to share their individual stories, or simply put, to say “Thank you for your service.” This initiative was inspired by her late father, Lieutenant Colonel (Ret) Frank J. Dallas, a Veteran of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam.</p><p class=\"\">“SoldierStrong is honored to recognize LTG (Ret) Patty Horoho with our individual 2024 Commitment to Service Award. Her work within the Veteran community and continued support of SoldierStrong have demonstrated her unwavering dedication to service, healthcare, mental health and Veterans,” said SoldierStrong co-founder and chairman Dr. Chris Meek. “I’ve always admired a sentiment attributed to General Horoho: ‘It’s wonderful to be the first, but you are committed to seeing that you’re not the last.’ Her career has been one of trailblazing, not just for herself, but for other women, particularly servicewomen, who have followed in her footsteps. General Horoho's leadership and impact continue to inspire, and her legacy serves as a beacon for all those who strive to serve with excellence, compassion, and vision.”</p><p class=\"\">“It is deeply humbling to be named the 2024 recipient of the SoldierStrong Commitment to Service Award, and I am truly grateful for this prestigious recognition,” said General Horoho. “SoldierStrong’s dedication to serving those who have sacrificed greatly for our democracy and our freedom is both inspiring and critical. I am delighted to be recognized by an organization that embodies the power of service, sacrifice and compassion that allows our Veterans to thrive with the dignity and respect they so richly deserve. It is a privilege to be part of this important work, and I look forward to continuing our collaboration with SoldierStrong.”</p><p class=\"\">Founded in 1989, the Bobby Rahal Automotive Group is a 13-dealership group in central and western Pennsylvania that represents the Acura, BMW, Honda, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lexus, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, and Volvo brands.

To date, they have contributed over $1 million in charitable funds to numerous organizations, including more than $260,000 in donations to SoldierStrong.</p><p class=\"\">“The Bobby Rahal Automotive Group’s commitment to charitable causes is second to none,” said Meek. “Recognizing Rahal Automotive with our corporate Commitment to Service Award serves as a testament to the selfless generosity their team continues to show by having the backs of those servicemen and women who have had our backs on the battlefield and beyond. Their ability to rally communities around life-changing causes is an example of benevolence, leadership and doing the right thing for all Americans to look up to.”</p><p class=\"\">“It is truly an honor to receive SoldierStrong’s Commitment to Service Award. It is our privilege to assist in efforts to bring cutting-edge medical devices and technology to improve the daily lives of the brave men and women who have selflessly served to protect and defend our country and its citizens,” said Harrisburg Area Bobby Rahal Automotive Group President, Brad Lee. “The SoldierStrong mission aligns perfectly with our core value and belief that involvement in the communities we serve is imperative and contributes to the growth and welfare of both the public and our company.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About SoldierStrong: </strong>Since 2009, SoldierStrong has assisted America’s military veterans in taking their next steps forward in life after service.

Gallo, MD</strong>, chairman of the Scientific Leadership Board and co-founder of the GVN. <!-- -->\"By fostering collaboration, driving innovation, and advancing scientific understanding, we are strengthening and enhancing the global health infrastructure. Each of these four new Centers brings invaluable expertise, and together, we will expand the frontiers of virus research and control, ensuring the protection of future generations from emerging threats.\" Dr. Gallo is also the James P. Cullison Professor of Medicine, director of the USF Health Virology Institute at the University of South Florida, and director of the Microbial Oncology Program at Tampa General Hospital (TGH) Cancer Institute.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Duke University School of Medicine</strong> comprises several entities that will collaborate well with the GVN. Duke Research and Discovery @RTP is a research hub for Duke University School of Medicine scientists devoted to the study of infectious diseases. Located in the world-famous Research Triangle Park (RTP), the campus is near more than 300 companies, including science and technology firms, government agencies, academic institutions, startups, and nonprofits. Additionally, the Duke Global Health Institute works to achieve health equity for vulnerable groups and individuals worldwide through research, education, and partnership. Importantly, the Duke Human Vaccine Institute (DHVI) continues to lead with cutting-edge vaccine research against infectious diseases that impact global health. Scientists at the DHVI conduct basic and translational research to develop novel vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics for diseases such as HIV-1, influenza, SARS-CoV-2, tuberculosis, syphilis, and gonorrhea. Several DHVI basic science discoveries are currently being produced in current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) facilities for early-phase vaccine trials.</p><p class=\"\">“We look forward to working with the GVN to help develop diagnostics for emerging pathogens, manufacture investigational biologics for use in Phase I clinical trials, and help conduct human trials of monoclonal antibodies or vaccines for re-emerging or emerging pathogens,” said <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Thomas N.

NIVB’s efforts focus on developing safe and effective therapies that counteract viruses and bacteria with pandemic potential. The design of new therapeutics requires a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that allow pathogens to infect cells and cause disease, which are unfortunately still poorly understood. Thus, NIVB focuses on a combination of basic and clinical research on viruses and pathogenic bacteria to better understand the processes by which pathogens cause disease, escape the immune system, and resist treatment. NIVB is comprised of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences (CAS), Masaryk University, Charles University, University of Chemistry and Technology Prague, Palacký University Olomouc, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the CAS, Institute of Microbiology of the CAS, and Biology Centre CAS.</p><p class=\"\">“NIVB was established with funding from the European Union’s program NextGenerationEU as part of a plan to recover Europe after the COVID-19 pandemic and to better prepare for future pandemics,” said <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Zdeněk Hostomský, PhD</strong>, director of the new center of excellence at the GVN and director of NIVB. <!-- -->“In addition to basic and applied research we conduct at the NIVB, the education of students and junior researchers is an integral and important part of our activities. Obtaining GVN membership is an opportunity for our young scientists to further their education and development while participating in the GVN's training programs and pursuing internships at GVN partner institutions. Further, our experienced researchers can share their expertise by contributing to the GVN training programs. Our laboratories are well-equipped, and we are happy to host colleagues from other GVN institutions. Because, above all, passing on experience to future generations is central to society's preparedness to face future pandemics and other challenges.”</p><p class=\"\">The Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania is one of the world’s leading academic medical centers, dedicated to the related missions of medical education, biomedical research, excellence in patient care, and community service.

The Perelman School of Medicine is consistently among the nation's top funding recipients from the National Institutes of Health, with $580 million awarded in the 2023 fiscal year. Home to a proud history of “firsts” in medicine, Penn Medicine teams have pioneered discoveries and innovations that have shaped modern medicine, including recent breakthroughs such as CAR T cell therapy for cancer and the Nobel Prize-winning mRNA technology used in COVID-19 vaccines.</p><p class=\"\">“I have been involved with the GVN for the past two years, having spoken at the 2023 and 2024 annual meetings and participated last year as a lecturer in the GVN Short Course for Translational Virology,” said <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Susan R. Weiss, PhD</strong>, director of the new center of excellence at the GVN and professor of microbiology, vice chair of the department of microbiology of the University of Pennsylvania, and director of the Penn Center for Research on Coronaviruses and Other Emerging Pathogens. <!-- -->“My own research involves human coronaviruses, and, most relevant to the GVN, we are investigating the determinants of MERS-CoV spillover into humans. I look forward to continuing to contribute my expertise in coronavirus biology and pathogenesis to the GVN. I am also eager to interact with international scientists to further investigate strains of MERS-CoV that are currently circulating and to evaluate the threat of future coronavirus pandemics. I initially joined the GVN as an individual member, and in this new capacity, I look forward to integrating other groups at Penn.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Yale University</strong>, founded in 1701, is one of the world’s premier universities.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Dominic Chopping</p><p class=\"\">Ferrari expects revenue and earnings to rise this year after it reported a strong end to 2024 thanks to growing demand for customized vehicles as well as its strong line-up of luxury sports models.</p><p class=\"\">The Italian sports-car maker reported revenue of 1.74 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in the fourth quarter, up 14% on year as it shipped 3,325 vehicles to customers--80 more than a year earlier. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast 1.65 billion euros in revenue, while shipments were seen at 3,333 units, according to LSEG Refinitiv data.</p><p class=\"\">Chief Executive Benedetto Vigna said 2024 was marked by a focus on the quality of revenue rather than volumes, as the company reported a sharp rise in profitability thanks to sales of higher-margin cars in higher-margin countries.</p><p class=\"\">\"On these solid foundations, we expect further robust growth in 2025, that will allow us to reach one year in advance the high-end of most of our profitability targets for 2026\" he said in a statement.</p><p class=\"\">Ferrari shares in Milan traded 3.8% higher in afternoon European trade.</p><p class=\"\">Fourth-quarter shipments rose by 4% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and by 8% in the Americas, Ferrari's two largest regional markets. Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan logged a 21% contraction in shipments, while the rest of Asia-Pacific recorded 5% growth.</p><p class=\"\">European auto makers have faced a torrid time of late as they grapple with intense competition in China, where local manufacturers have been launching new models at aggressive price points while economic challenges have seen consumers pare back on high-end spending. But Ferrari has been sheltered from the turmoil thanks to its limited exposure to China and its ability to maintain margins as it sells to more exclusive customers than ordinary manufacturers.</p><p class=\"\">In China, sports cars are a smaller part of the luxury market than other regions. Ferrari wants to keep sales in the country below 10% of its overall deliveries as it is a lower-margin region due to high taxes.</p><p class=\"\">Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan accounted for only around 8% of the company's global car shipments in 2024.</p><p class=\"\">Analysts also expect Ferrari to weather any trade charges levied on European imports into the U.S., should President Trump follow through with threats to hit the EU with tariffs.</p><p class=\"\">Ferraris are exclusively produced in Italy, so all of its cars for the U.S. market are imports, but analysts at Bernstein say the company is protected by its strong pricing power.</p><p class=\"\">Net profit in the quarter grew to 386 million euros from 294 million euros, ahead of the 335 million euros analysts had forecast.</p><p class=\"\">Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization rose to 643 million euros from 558 million euros, generating a 37.0% margin. Meanwhile, earnings before interest and taxes increased to 468 million euros from 372 million euros, generating a 27.0% margin.</p><p class=\"\">Analysts had forecast Ebitda of 631 million euros and EBIT of 442 million euros.</p><p class=\"\">Ferrari set its full-year 2025 revenue target at more than 7 billion euros, after achieving 2024 revenue of 6.68 billion euros.</p><p class=\"\">The company is targeting 2025 adjusted Ebitda of at least 2.68 billion euros, from 2.56 billion euros in 2024, with a margin of at least 38.3%. Its 2025 EBIT target is for at least 2.03 billion euros, from 1.89 billion euros, with a margin of at least 29.0%.</p><p class=\"\">If successful, most metrics would land above the 2026 targets it laid out more than two years ago.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Dominic Chopping at dominic.chopping@wsj.com</p></span></div>",
