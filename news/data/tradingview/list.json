That comes on the back of Chinese firm DeepSeek apparently demonstrating cutting-edge models can be developed for a fraction of the previously assumed cost.</p><p class=\"\">\"I think one of the obvious lessons of DeepSeek-R1 is something that we've been saying for the last two years, which is that the models are commoditizing,\" Palantir's Chief Technology Officer Shyam Sankar told analysts on an earnings call. \"Yes, they're getting better across both closed and open, but they're also getting more similar. And the price of inference is dropping like a rock.\"</p><p class=\"\">Other companies potentially placed to benefit from that shift include cloud-based data storage company Snowflake, its privately owned rival Databricks, and customer-relationship software company Salesforce.</p><p class=\"\">\"[Palantir's] guidance for strong 54% U.S. commercial revs [revenue] growth in 2025 is a positive signal for primarily Databricks (according to our checks, Palantir and Databricks appear best-positioned to see AI pull-through) but to some degree Snowflake,\" wrote UBS analyst Karl Keirstead in a research note on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"\">Snowflake last year launched its own large-language model that the cloud-based data-warehousing firm claimed was the best option for enterprise AI applications. Snowflake said it trained the model in less than three months, with a budget of under $2 million.</p><p class=\"\">Snowflake shares were rising 3.5% in morning trading. Another gainer was Salesforce, which was up 0.7%.</p><p class=\"\">Salesforce is one of the software companies pushing ahead fastest with \"AI agents,\" or agentic AI. The terms refer to systems that can make decisions for businesses, helping them with issues such as customer interaction.</p><p class=\"\">\"A lower cost of compute could bring down AI computing costs of sales and drive better margin on AI enabled offerings. More importantly, agentic application providers could pass savings on to enterprises via lower price, which could provide a catalyst for adoption/proliferation of agents,\" wrote BofA Securities analyst Brad Sills in a recent research note.</p><p class=\"\">Salesforce plans to lay off more than 1,000 employees as it shifts focus to AI products, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">WATKINSVILLE, GA / ACCESS Newswire / February 4, 2025 / Just two years ago, <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Washington County Regional Medical Center (WCRMC)</strong>, a 56-bed hospital in Sandersville, Ga., population 5,831, was on life support. Facing multi-million-dollar annual operational losses, it seemed unlikely that WCRMC could survive.</p><p class=\"\">If the hospital didn't make it, it would not be alone. Since 2020, 36 rural hospitals in the U.S. have closed[i]-a statistic that's more than alarming. Yet, it doesn't even come close to revealing what may yet lie ahead for rural hospitals.</p><p class=\"\">A February 2024 Chartis report found 418 other rural hospitals are at risk of closure and that 50% of these vulnerable facilities are currently operating in the red-that's the highest percentage of rural hospitals losing money in the past decade.[ii]</p><p class=\"\">What's going on? The bottom line is rural hospitals simply cannot continue to care for patients while simultaneously shouldering the enormous and ever-increasing regulatory burdens and reimbursement cuts related to operations and hospital management. However, the importance of rural hospitals to their communities and for local access to care, cannot be overstated.</p><p class=\"\">The issues are complex and come from all angles, and while all hospitals face similar challenges, they are unique in how the problems impact them. Workforce shortages. Inability to offer competitive salaries. Decreases in Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements, as well as 3rd party insurance payments. The inability to invest in needed equipment and technology. Or to afford required upgrades to their facilities.</p><p class=\"\">Then there are the issues happening behind the scenes, like low staff morale or a tarnished hospital reputation, which factor into financial losses. A host of other factors play into the mix related to rules and regulations, too. Case in point: Rural hospitals staff their emergency rooms 24/7. However, hospitals only get paid if patients come in.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">WCRMC Brings In Aletheia Health Partners</strong></p><p class=\"\">WCRMC faced many of these same challenges, including the fact the hospital's ER had earned a reputation with some as a \"band-aid station\" and town residents avoided going there for care. It had also been difficult recruiting/retaining staff and investing in needed resources.</p><p class=\"\">In August of 2022, WCRMC asked strategic advisory and management group, Aletheia Health Partners (AHP), to help them stop their monthly bleed and set them on a course for sustainability. As a result, Aletheia started consulting with WCRMC and AHP's Chief Administrative Officer, Kerry Trapnell, and he took the helm as interim CEO in January of 2023. Aletheia stepped in as the new management team in May of 2023.</p><p class=\"\">Trapnell and the Aletheia team placed priority on listening to the community and to hospital staff to understand the complexities and nuances that were contributing to the financial loss. This process revealed the most critical areas where bleed was happening, allowing Aletheia to offer recommendations to WCRMC, which WCRMC asked them to swiftly put into motion. This included eliminating nearly all high-cost contract clinical positions which included agency staffing and emergency room providers. Of those that needed to remain, the hospital went from managing over 30 individual contracts, to just a handful.</p><p class=\"\">This freed up funds that were used to increase salaries for nurses-who hadn't seen pay raises in years. Other staff eventually received pay increases, too. Another step taken included identifying areas of staff overlap and cost cutting to reduce these redundancies. Other savings allowed for new services and resources to be added into WCRMC, such as growing specialist surgeons in the community, a new nuclear medicine program, and a new CT scanner.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Pamela Stewart Becomes CEO</strong></p><p class=\"\">Each win allowed the hospital to regain more sure footing, and in December 2023, WCRMC named its new CEO, Pamela Stewart. Stewart had a significant 20-year history with WCRMC, working as a nurse and in compliance-related roles. Prior to accepting the CEO position, she served as interim Chief Nursing Officer. Her background also included working for The Joint Commission, where she gained additional insights into hospital and care quality, safety, and performance. As a bonus, Sandersville is Stewart's hometown.</p><p class=\"\">Stewart credits Aletheia with their expertise in rural hospital operations as key to the turnaround. But she is quick to point out that, because they are rooted in and deeply understand rural communities, Aletheia was able to do what others who came before them could not.</p><p class=\"\">Notably, the process included listening to concerns from community leaders, attending meetings, getting to know the community leaders, and eventually regaining their trust. Combining this with a \"show, don't tell\" approach, community leaders could see that tangible, significant and swift financial gains were actually happening at WCRMC. This newly forged relationship and demonstrated successes went a long way in securing a $15.5 million bond in 2024 from the Washington County Commissioners for hospital projects. The funds will be applied to new equipment, a new emergency department, remodeled inpatient rooms, remodeled nursing home, and other infrastructure and facility improvements.</p><p class=\"\">\"When Aletheia started working with Washington, the hospital had over $4 million in accounts payable and almost no cash. So we had to deal with old debt, while also paying current expenses. While we have done a lot, where we are going next would not be possible without the help of the county,\" stated Trapnell. \"By the county trusting our demonstrated commitment to the hospital and the community, we have the benefit of their financial support via the bond. Ultimately, the staff, the hospital facility, and the community will be beneficiaries of the county working as a partner with us, allowing our team to forge ahead in our quest to be a shining example of rural healthcare.\"</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">From Surviving to Thriving</strong></p><p class=\"\">Within 24 months, the hospital went from losing millions of dollars each year to generating a profit. Today they are thriving and are poised to break ground on a new Emergency Department in early 2025, using a portion of county-generated funding. And, a new MRI, one of only two available in the state of Georgia that includes the capability to test for post-COVID cardiac issues, was obtained through a grant Aletheia helped WCRMC achieve and will be installed in the WCRMC radiology department in the fall of 2024. Aletheia also pursued and was awarded other grants totaling over $2 million to assist with adding new services.</p><p class=\"\">\"Part of our commitment to the county includes our team pursing every grant opportunity we can, in an effort to do our part obtaining funding. And, with Aletheia's help, we have done just that,\" said Stewart. \"As a Sandersville native and CEO of the hospital, I'm truly excited about our partnership with Aletheia. Admittedly, I was hesitant at first to use another management company, but in the last two years, their team has proven over and over they are fully invested in our hospital and our community. The changes we have made and the improvements on the way ensure that people in our area have access to outstanding care, right here at home.\"</p><p class=\"\">Today, hospital services and capabilities include the following with more improvements on the way:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\">Comprehensive inpatient and outpatient surgery services</p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\">24-hour physician staffed emergency room</p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\">Imaging Center, Rehabilitation Services (Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Speech Therapy), Wound Care, Respiratory Therapy, Cardiac Rehabilitation, Swing-Bed, Inpatient and Outpatient Surgery, ICU, Telemedicine, Lab and Ambulance Services</p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\">Pediatric Clinic, Sleep Center, and a Specialty Clinic offering Cardiac and Orthopedic Services</p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Into the Future</strong></p><p class=\"\">The groundwork has been laid and the future is bright not only for WCRMC as a hospital, but for local health care for the citizens of Sandersville and surrounding areas. The financial turnaround of the hospital goes against the grain of what is happening across the state and the country, but it also means it can be done. One key viewpoint Aletheia brings to the table is helping their rural hospital clients to stop looking outward at \"what is being done wrong to them\" with respect to payors, insurance, and regulations but rather focus inward to make sure the elements that are in their control are maximized and executed to the best of their ability, for the betterment of their hospital. Aletheia is of the firm belief when there is leadership, a framework, funding, and importantly, local support, rural hospitals can not only be stabilized, but they can also thrive and regain their place as a healthcare partner in their communities.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Aletheia Health Partners</strong></p><p class=\"\">Aletheia Health Partners helps rural hospitals become solid and strong so they can focus on what matters most: patient care. As a community-focused hospital management company, Aletheia Health Partners provides management and operations service modules including human resources, revenue cycle management, and pharmacy services - all with the goal of creating a path for rural hospitals to remain sustainable for the communities they serve.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Kristina Peterson and Liz Essley Whyte</p><p class=\"\">WASHINGTON — The nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Health and Human Services Department advanced Tuesday after a key swing Republican voted for the nominee in the Senate Finance Committee, likely clearing his path to confirmation.</p><p class=\"\">Sen. Bill Cassidy (R., La.), a medical doctor, voted with all of the committee's Republicans to support Kennedy's confirmation.</p><p class=\"\">His vote followed an unusually intense pressure campaign from Kennedy, his supporters and the Trump administration over the weekend and up to the committee's vote.</p><p class=\"\">To secure Kennedy's support, the nominee and administration agreed to a number of concessions, Cassidy said, including promises to maintain current federal vaccine recommendations and keep intact Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website pages that say there isn't a link between vaccines and autism.</p><p class=\"\">Kennedy and the Trump administration committed to establish \"an unprecedentedly close, collaborative working relationship,\" Cassidy said, and set up safeguards to ensure the public's continued access to vaccines.</p><p class=\"\">\"I will use my authority as chairman of the Senate committee with oversight of HHS to rebuff any attempt to remove the public access to lifesaving vaccines without iron-clad causational scientific evidence,\" Cassidy said on the Senate floor after Tuesday's vote.</p><p class=\"\">The committee vote signaled that Kennedy's path to becoming the top U.S. health official was becoming smoother. The final tally was 14 to 13.</p><p class=\"\">In the full Senate vote, Kennedy can afford to lose as many as three Republican votes if all Democrats oppose him. In the event of a tie, Vice President JD Vance can cast the deciding vote.</p><p class=\"\">Potential GOP defectors include Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, a polio survivor; Lisa Murkowski of Alaska; and Susan Collins of Maine. No Republicans have said they plan to oppose Kennedy.</p><p class=\"\">The full Senate vote to confirm Kennedy hasn't been scheduled but could come as soon as next week.</p><p class=\"\">If confirmed, Kennedy would lead a powerful department with a $1.7 trillion budget regulating things as diverse as prescription medicines and food dyes and overseeing Medicare health insurance for the elderly and health services for Native Americans.</p><p class=\"\">Shares of vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna fell after the Kennedy vote.</p><p class=\"\">Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla told analysts during an earnings call Tuesday he expects Kennedy to have a \"more tempered view\" of vaccines as HHS secretary based on what he has seen from comments from Kennedy and the Trump administration.</p><p class=\"\">Bourla also said he doesn't expect the government to change vaccine manufacturers' liability protections because doing so requires congressional approval. The Trump administration doesn't want to see another health crisis. \"I feel cautiously optimistic that they will be very, very prudent,\" Bourla said.</p><p class=\"\">A scion of the famous Democratic family, Kennedy ran for president last year and then suspended his campaign last summer and endorsed Donald Trump, saying they had a joint mission to \"Make America Healthy Again.\"</p><p class=\"\">The phrase became a rallying cry picked up by many Republicans. Yet many Democrats and health authorities expressed concern over some of its tenets, because Kennedy has questioned the safety of vaccines and suggested unproven links between the shots and a range of chronic diseases, including autism.</p><p class=\"\">More than 20 large-scale studies involving hundreds of thousands of children in several countries have discredited any association between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines and autism. Additional large studies strongly suggest that no vaccine causes autism.</p><p class=\"\">Democrats on the committee said Kennedy could undermine public health if he were confirmed. He had also struggled to answer questions about Medicare and Medicaid over two days of hearings last week.</p><p class=\"\">Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the committee's top Democrat, said Kennedy was \"singularly unfit\" for the post of Health secretary and would pose \"a grave threat to the health of the American people.\"</p><p class=\"\">But Republicans hold a majority on the Finance committee, and most of the GOP committee members had coalesced around Kennedy, even though the nominee had in the past voiced support for abortion rights.</p><p class=\"\">Sen. Thom Tillis (R., N.C.) said the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Rifle Association and groups that oppose abortion rights didn't actively oppose Kennedy.</p><p class=\"\">The partisan divide left Cassidy with the swing vote. His position was fraught. He had voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial. Now, Cassidy faces a primary challenger in his coming election in 2026.</p><p class=\"\">Yet Cassidy had said last week that he had been \"struggling\" over Kennedy's past comments about vaccines and the role they have played in making some parents hesitant to vaccinate their children.</p><p class=\"\">The Louisiana Republican had urged Kennedy during hearings on the nomination to make clear that he didn't believe vaccines caused autism, but Kennedy had sidestepped such an endorsement, saying he would review the data.</p><p class=\"\">Cassidy became the target of an intense persuasion campaign from Kennedy, his supporters and the Trump administration.</p><p class=\"\">\"MAHA moms packed the halls of the Senate and made thousands of calls,\" said Kennedy adviser Calley Means. \"Their voice was heard.\"</p><p class=\"\">As the committee vote neared, President Trump urged lawmakers to support Kennedy in a social-media post. \"20 years ago, Autism in children was 1 in 10,000. NOW IT'S 1 in 34. WOW! Something's really wrong. We need BOBBY!!!\" Trump wrote.</p><p class=\"\">Cassidy said he held a series of phone calls with Kennedy over the weekend and Tuesday morning before the committee's vote. During the calls, the senator said, Kennedy promised an unusually close working relationship.</p><p class=\"\">Cassidy said Kennedy, in addition to keeping federal vaccine recommendations and CDC web pages on vaccines and autism, committed to not set up alternate safety monitoring or approval systems for vaccines.</p><p class=\"\">Kennedy pledged that HHS would provide 30-day notice before any changes to vaccine-safety monitoring systems and would generally speak to Cassidy several times a month, the senator said.</p><p class=\"\">The nominee also offered Cassidy input on hiring decisions at HHS and promised Cassidy that the Senate health committee could choose a representative \"on any board or commission formed to review vaccine safety,\" Cassidy said.</p><p class=\"\">\"My support is built on assurances that this will not have to be a concern,\" Cassidy said of vaccines. \"He will be the secretary, but I believe he will also be a partner.\"</p><p class=\"\">Cassidy arrived late to the committee vote, walking into the room with Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R., S.D.).</p><p class=\"\">\"I've had very intense conversations with Bobby and the White House over the weekend and even this morning,\" Cassidy said in a social-media post shortly before the vote. \"I want to thank VP JD specifically for his honest counsel.\"</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Jared S.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Paul R. La Monica</p><p class=\"\">Worries about tariffs are spooking many investors. But not gold bulls. Fans of the yellow metal are probably relishing all the uncertainty that President Donald Trump's tariff threats are creating.</p><p class=\"\">Gold prices are up nearly 9% already this year At just under $2,900 an ounce, the yellow metal is at a record high. And that follows a nearly 30% gain for gold in 2024.</p><p class=\"\">Investors in mining stocks are doing even better. The VanEck Gold Miners exchange-traded fund, which has big stakes in Newmont Corp., Agnico Eagle Mines and Barrick Gold, has soared 18% so far in 2025.</p><p class=\"\">Should investors be a little wary after such a big run this year on top of 2024's massive gains? Of course. That would be prudent. But it's worth noting that the mining stocks could have more room to run if gold prices keep climbing. And that seems very plausible.</p><p class=\"\">It appears that both foreign central banks and retail investors are fueling the rally. Poland, Turkey, India, and China have been big buyers, according to data from late last year from the World Gold Council.</p><p class=\"\">\"Emerging market banks are very committed to gold and well positioned to purchase more. Strategically, they will continue to be buyers,\" said Joe Cavatoni, senior markets strategist with the World Gold Council, in an interview with Barron's.</p><p class=\"\">It's all about the Trump trade war. The continued surge in gold is a bit unusual since it's happening at a time when the U.S. dollar is also strengthening.</p><p class=\"\">Frank Watson, a markets analyst for Kinesis Money, pointed out that a surging greenback is \"normally a bearish element for dollar-denominated gold prices,\" but he added that \"gold's safe haven appeal remains undiminished amid uncertainty over the economic and inflationary effects of expected US trade tariffs.\" In other words, Trump trade policies may trump the usual impact a strong dollar has on gold.</p><p class=\"\">Silver prices have been climbing too, rising about 13% so far this year. Alex Ebkarian, chief operating officer of physical precious metals dealer Allegiance Gold, said in an email to Barron's that the prices of both metals should keep climbing due to the market uncertainty.</p><p class=\"\">\"In a high-risk environment, the appeal of physical gold and silver becomes even more pronounced, as they eliminate counterparty risk and provide a reliable store of value,\" he said, adding that the recent move by JPMorgan Chase to deliver about $4 billion worth in gold futures is \"an apparent hedge against potential trade disruptions.\"</p><p class=\"\">So how much higher could gold go? Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for State Street's SPDR Business, thinks gold could top $3,000 an ounce sometime this year due to all that's happening on the worldwide landscape.</p><p class=\"\">\"Geopolitical risks and structural transitions in monetary and fiscal policies should also boost the prospects for gold,\" Arone wrote. \"Central bank purchases throughout the year will likely continue to support gold's price. All that could finally unleash some pent up investment demand from investors chasing last year's record gold prices.\"</p><p class=\"\">That should be good news as well for the mining stocks, which despite their big run already this year, remain reasonably valued. The VanEck Gold Miners ETF is trading for just 12 times 2025 earnings estimates, lower than its 5-year average of 15. It's also trading at about a price-to-earnings ratio that is 45% below the S&amp;P 500, much steeper than its usual 20% discount to the broader market.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Paul R.

GDP slowed to 1.5% in 2024 from 3.3% the previous year, according to statistics institute Inegi. While public security remained the top perceived obstacle to growth, the percentage of analysts citing foreign trade policy rose to 13% from 7% in the previous survey. On Monday, Mexico reached agreement with President Trump to hold off imposing 25% tariffs on Mexican goods for a month while Mexico takes action to curb migration and fentanyl trafficking. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1313 ET - A few days after its quarterly launch, the Atlanta Fed's real-time estimate of 1Q GDP shows the U.S. economy growing at a 3.9% annualized pace over the three months through March. That would be a sharp step up from the 2.3% annualized rate recorded in 4Q 2024 and is well above most Wall Street analysts' forecasts. The model hasn't ingested much 1Q data yet, but recent construction-spending data and ISM manufacturing indexes have pushed the forecast in a positive direction. The first official estimates of 1Q GDP from the Commerce Department are expected to land in late April. (matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)</p><p class=\"\">1154 ET - Economist and market strategist David Rosenberg says he believes Canada and Mexico should have called President Trump's bluff on a 25% tariff. \"That may end up having been a mistake,\" says the head of Rosenberg Research. In a note to clients after the tariff reprieve, Rosenberg says he believes trade uncertainty overhanging Canada and Mexico will dissipate. \"The 30-day reprieve is a joke. Trump is not raising tariffs and probably was never going to,\" Rosenberg says. Canada now avoids a deep recession, Rosenberg says. The Canadian dollar has strengthened, with USDCAD at C$1.4318, or down 3.2% from a Sunday night peak. Still, Rosenberg sticks to his call for USDCAD at C$1.62, with Canada's economy set to underperform the U.S. and require more rate relief. (Paul.Vieira@wsj.com, @paulvieira)</p><p class=\"\">1127 ET - U.S. farmers carried an optimistic outlook into 2025, according to the latest Ag Economy Barometer published by Purdue University and the CME Group. Surveyed farmers say that their view of current conditions of the agricultural economy have improved, buoyed by a month of gains for row crop prices on the CBOT. Farmers are increasingly expecting to have a 'more robust' year financially than last year — although some concerns remain. Some 42% of surveyed farmers identified trade policy as their top policy concern over the next five years. Even so, 40% of farmers now say a trade war is likely or very likely, down 8 points from last month's survey. Some 29% say a trade war is unlikely or very unlikely, which is an 8 point increase from last month. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1119 ET - Supply of covered bonds by European banks is expected to decline in 2025, partly due to weak economic growth, ING's Marine Leleux says in a note. ING expects supply of euro-denominated covered bonds to drop by 7 billion euros ($7.24 billion) this year versus 2024. A high number of redemptions due this year could mean bond refinancing dominates covered-bond supply this year, she says.(miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1100 ET - Risk premia, or spreads, on euro-denominated credit are expected to tighten further in February, Societe Generale's Juan Valencia says in a note. In recent years, euro credit spreads have tightened modestly in February, excluding in 2020 due to the impact of Covid-19 and in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The pattern is likely to continue with slight spread tightening this February, he says. \"At the moment we don't see much evidence of a correction with spreads widening any time soon,\" Valencia says. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1059 ET - U.S. and European high-yield bond issuers are well-equipped to cope with upcoming maturities, says MFS Investment Management's Benoit Anne in a note. Refinancing risk is therefore not a major challenge. \"In the U.S., it is not until 2028 and 2029 that the volume of maturities falling due peaks up, which leaves us with a couple of years of cushion,\" he says. In Europe, a significant number of maturies fall due in 2026 and 2027, but interest-rate cuts by the European Central Bank are likely to ease some of the refinancing pain, Anne says. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1050 ET - Generative artificial intelligence is here to stay, and set to have a profound impact on the mergers and acquisitions market, Bain &amp; Company says in a report. \"We expect that companies that master the use of generative AI in M&amp;A over the next five years will identify targets faster than their competitors,\" the management-consulting firm says. About one in five surveyed companies currently uses generative AI in M&amp;A processes, and more than half expect to integrate it into their dealmaking by 2027, according to the report. Late followers to adopt AI will be outbid for good deals and find themselves staying too long in the process for bad deals, Bain &amp; Company says. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1047 ET - Duration from a long-term perspective looks attractive, although the tactical--or short-term--case for being long U.S. duration has become more challenging, says MFS Investment Management's Benoit Anne in a note. The case for fixed income is even stronger outside of the U.S., he says. In Europe, there are strong arguments in favor of both tactical and strategic exposure to fixed income given the significant monetary policy divergence between the U.S. and the eurozone, he says. The Federal Reserve paused last week, while the European Central Bank cut interest rates by 25 basis points. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1041 ET - Light-vehicle sales in January indicate Canadian consumers are unperturbed about the economic uncertainty circling over President Trump's trade policy. Research firm DesRosiers Automotive Consultants says its data indicate vehicle sales in January rose 3.1% from the same year-ago month, and in terms of volumes matching the best January ever recorded, back in 2018. On a seasonally-adjusted basis, light-vehicle sales came at a \"strapping\" 2.15 million, DesRosiers says. The firm adds it's difficult to put January's performance in context, given Trump's tariff threat. As a result, DesRosiers says it's hard to discern whether strong sales were the result of fears over sharply higher car prices, or a sign of solid domestic demand. (paul.vieira@wsj.com; @paulvieira)</p><p class=\"\">1028 ET - Germany's current political turmoil, with elections to be held later this month, should have a muted impact on German government bonds, says MFS Investment Management's Annalisa Piazza in a note. \"Swap spreads have moved well in advance and are already pricing in some political and policy changes (such as more fiscal space),\" the fixed income research analyst says. MFS IM expects the German bond curve to remain the go-to safe haven among eurozone government bonds in the medium term. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1008 ET - The euro has limited scope to recover even as hopes rise that the EU can avert threatened U.S. trade tariffs after President Trump postponed a levy on Canadian and Mexican imports, ING's Francesco Pesole says in a note. Trump's decision to delay tariffs on his U.S. neighbors could reflect domestic backlash over potential economic pain for U.S. consumers but the same isn't necessarily true for the EU, he says. Trump can afford to keep EU tariffs in place for a prolonged period, making the bloc feel some pain before striking a deal. \"With all this in mind, we are somewhat sceptical that the euro is bound for a major rally.\" The euro rises 0.2% to $1.0364.
