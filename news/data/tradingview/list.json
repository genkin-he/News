WTI settles down 0.6% at $72.70 a barrel, while international benchmark Brent edges up 0.3% to $76.20 a barrel. The Chinese tariff on $5 billion of U.S. energy imports suggests a \"softer tone of the response\" to the U.S. tariffs, Alex Hodes of StoneX says in a note. \"The tariffs are also not expected to come into play until Feb. 10, leaving room for negotiations between the two nations.\" (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1506 ET - U.S. natural gas futures lose ground, but end above the day's lows as weather forecasts shift between colder and milder. The impact of China's decision to slap a 15% retaliatory tariff on imports of U.S. LNG is difficult to gauge, forecaster NatGasWeather.com says in a note. \"Weather trends the next few days will continue to be very important and are likely to dictate the direction of trade.\" The Nymex front month settles down 3% at $3.253/mmBtu. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0936 ET - U.S. natural gas futures hand back some of the previous day's gains as weather forecasts continue to vary over how cold February is likely to be. China announced a 15% tariff to be placed on imports of U.S. LNG as of Feb. 10, in response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. \"In the immediate term, Chinese offtakers may shy away from U.S.-sourced spot LNG purchases--but U.S. LNG may simply backfill other Asian supply that China lifts instead,\" Eli Rubin of EBW Analytics says in a note. The tariffs could affect longer-term contracting, however, he adds. The Nymex front month is down 5.2% at $3.177/mmBtu. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0925 ET - Crude prices extend losses in midday trade amid heightened fears of a trade war between the U.S. and China that could hurt global growth and increase inflationary pressures. Brent crude is down 2.3% to $74.22 a barrel, while WTI falls 3.3% to $70.75 a barrel. Both benchmarks erased all the previous session's gains, also due to easing concerns over immediate disruption of Canadian and Mexican oil flows after U.S. President Trump agreed to hold off imposing tariffs on the two neighboring countries. \"The next key support levels to watch are $69.50 and $66,\" says Razan Hilal, market analyst at Forex. \"A deeper decline could signal the start of a more extended bearish trend.\" (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0910 ET - Oil futures are lower as China retaliates against U.S. tariffs with duties on U.S. exports including oil and LNG, to take effect Feb. 10. The tariff is particularly negative for WTI, says TP ICAP's Scott Shelton in a note. \"I would assume with a $7 tax roughly, that arb is firmly shut and WTI will have to go elsewhere in the next few months as we go into turnarounds.\" U.S. refineries reduce their crude use during the maintenance season, leading to builds in U.S. crude stocks. WTI is down 2.7% at $71.16 a barrel. Brent is 1.8% lower at $74.61 a barrel. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0745 ET - China's counter tariffs on U.S. imports aren't expected to have a significant impact on the oil market, according to Commerzbank Research. Beijing said it would impose a 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas products as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil and other products such as agricultural machinery, effective on Feb. 10. \"As China only sourced 1.8% of its crude oil imports from the U.S. last year, the impact on the oil market should be limited,\" commodity analyst Carsten Fritsch says in a note. (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0620 ET - Machinery cyclical stock would be the most affected by U.S tariffs in the capital-goods sector, Deutsche Bank Research analyst Gael de-Bray says in a research note. Most industrial companies that have reported so far beat expectations on orders and revenue. The downturn in manufacturing activity that began in 2022 was just starting to show signs of easing, de-Bray says. However, the uncertainty, extra costs and inflation brought forth by new U.S tariffs could derail this nascent industrial recovery, the analyst says. With the risk of a global recession rising, Swedish SKF and Sandvik are likely first in line to feel the impact. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0450 ET - European natural-gas prices ease but continue to hover around their 15-month high, with the benchmark Dutch TTF down 0.9% to 53.32 euros a megawatt hour. \"The gas prices in Europe have continued to grow, and TTF is currently on par with the levels we saw at the end of 2023,\" DNB Markets analysts say. However, \"we still see that the market expects significant LNG volumes to reach the market in 2026, pushing the price down.\" The EU needs more LNG to meet its storage-filling target of 90% by Nov. 1., but inventories have been depleting fast and the bloc barely reached the Feb. 1 target of 50%. As of Sunday, EU gas storage was 52.6% full, with particularly high daily net withdrawals in Germany due to low wind-power generation. (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0359 ET - Oil prices fall more than 1% as immediate concerns over supply disruptions ease after U.S. President Trump paused tariffs on Mexico and Canada, the country's biggest foreign suppliers of crude. Brent is down 1.3% at $74.95 a barrel, while WTI falls 2% to $71.70 a barrel. Meanwhile, as a 10% U.S. tariff on Chinese imports came into effect Tuesday, Beijing announced its decision to retaliate with a 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas imports and a 10% levy on American crude oil and agricultural machinery, starting Monday. The move raised fears of a trade war that could ultimately hurt global growth and dampen demand, putting further pressure on prices. (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0321 ET - OMV delivered positive fourth-quarter results underlined by a better-than-expected dividend per share of 4.75 euros, Jefferies analysts Giacomo Romeo and Kai Ye Loh write. The Austrian oil and gas company's net income exceeded expectations by 14% due to a lower-than-expected tax rate and net financial result, they write. Despite reporting profit in-line with expectations, quarterly cash-flow generation was 10% lower than expected, they add. The company's 2025 guidance is now for lower-than-expected capital expenditure of 3.5 billion euros and weak production of 300,000 barrels of oil-equivalent a day, the analysts write. Shares fall 0.9% to 38.84 euros. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

Chipotle Mexican Grill said sales in its restaurants and across the industry remain depressed in the state as a result. Chipotle said it's holding off additional price increases for now beyond a nationwide 2% increase taken in December. (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)</p><p class=\"\">1724 ET - Brambles may disappoint some investors by deciding against upgrading its annual guidance at its first-half result announcement, according to its bull at UBS. Analyst Andre Fromyhr writes in a note that the stronger U.S. dollar makes Brambles' free cashflow guidance more challenging than when it was announced. Even so, he expects the global pallet giant to maintain guidance. Fromyhr reckons that Brambles needs to consistently deliver US$800 million annual free cashflow without strong price growth or dropping capex before the stock rerates further. UBS lifts its target price 18% to A$22.50 and keeps a buy rating on the stock, which is at A$19.26 ahead of the open. (stuart.condie@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1714 ET - Profit margins of Australian companies have probably already troughed at mid-cycle levels, UBS says. Many of Australia's biggest listed companies will report earnings this month, giving investors the chance to do a pulse check on trading conditions. Strategist Richard Schellbach highlights prior concerns about companies' ability to maintain profit margins. But these concerns were unfounded, UBS says, as management was able to pass costs on to their customers. \"The latest monthly data points still show business selling prices moving commensurately with their input costs,\" UBS says. And with the unemployment rate remaining low over the past six months, \"this dynamic of being able to pass through costs remains favorable in most industries,\" UBS adds. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)</p><p class=\"\">1711 ET - Mexican chain Chipotle Mexican Grill is known for its guacamole, and is working to source its avocados and other supplies beyond Mexico to keep providing it. The company said in a 4Q earnings call that it now sources goods from Colombia, Peru and the Dominican Republic, with half of its avocados coming from Mexico. Tariffs on supplies from Mexico are a looming threat for U.S. companies. Chipotle said it would have a financial hit if the tariffs come to pass. (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)</p><p class=\"\">1658 ET - NextDC's bull at Citi sees a lack of contract announcements and not worries over the impact of DeepSeek as the most likely explanation for the data-center operator's share-price underperformance. Analyst Siraj Ahmed acknowledges that the stock has lagged peers, but tells clients in a note that the accelerated fit-out of Melbourne centers suggests that new contract wins are probably on the way. He cuts his target price on the stock by 6.5% to A$18.70 but reiterates his buy rating. Shares are at A$14.74 ahead of the open. (stuart.condie@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1656 ET - Mondelez International said it expects adjusted earnings per share to decline about 10% in 2025 due to cocoa cost inflation. The Chicago-based food and snack company produces Oreo, Toblerone and Cadbury chocolate, among other cocoa-based products. High cocoa prices have forced the snack giant to raise some prices in recent quarters. \"Our teams are well-equipped to stay agile and take the necessary actions to navigate this challenging operating environment,\" CEO Dirk Van de Put said.

ASX futures are up by 0.6% ahead of Wednesday's session, suggesting that the S&amp;P/ASX 200 benchmark index will rally from its 1.9% decline across consecutive losses so far this week. U.S. indices provided a positive lead, bouncing despite China's announcement of retaliatory tariffs. The DJIA rose 0.3%, the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite put on 1.35%. ASX 200 companies scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday include Beach Energy. Real-estate investor BWP Trust said its first-half profit rose almost threefold on the same time a year earlier. (stuart.condie@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1604 ET - Major stock indexes rise as the delay on tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for a month, eases some concerns over a multi-front trade war. The Trump administration did implement tariffs on China which struck back with levies of its own on certain American goods, an antitrust probe into Google and restrictions on Chinese exports of key minerals. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination to lead the Health and Human Services Department advances to the full Senate, putting pressure on shares of big food companies and vaccine makers. DJIA gains 134 points, or 0.3%, to 44556, the S&amp;P 500 rises 0.7% to 6037 and the Nasdaq climbs 1.4% to 19654.

GM shares rise 1.4%. (connor.hart@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1252 ET - Tariffs would certainly dampen Ball's current outlook, Chief Executive Dan Fisher says on a call with analysts. The aluminum-can maker has spent the better part of the last few weeks renegotiating deals with its Chinese aluminum suppliers in an attempt to mitigate a $40 million to $50 million issue, he says: \"I think we've got that resolved down to a couple million dollars.\" The larger concern now revolves around consumer sentiment. Consumers are already pretty stressed, Fisher says, adding that higher costs stemming from a 25% tariff would stifle demand and be a headwind to growth. Shares fall 8% after Ball reports a decline in 4Q sales and logs a loss. (connor.hart@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1247 ET - PepsiCo turned in mixed results for 4Q as strong international growth was offset by softer-than-expected results in North America, Edward Jones analyst Brittany Quatrochi says in a research note. Trends in North America are still sluggish as consumers continue to seek out value, which has been cutting into salty snack sales, the analyst says. The company is also still recovering from a product recall at Quaker, she says. Given its challenges with the U.S. consumer, PepsiCo is guiding for 2025 earnings growth to be weaker than its long-term outlook, the analyst says. Shares fall 4.4% to $143.71. (dean.seal@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1232 ET - PayPal handily topped 4Q earnings estimates and approved a major new stock buyback, but investors seem caught up on shifts at its behind-the-scenes payment processing unit Braintree, Susquehanna analyst James Friedman says in a research note. Total payment volume growth at Braintree decelerated from 30% in FY 2023 to 2% in 4Q and could turn negative, Friedman says, as clients weigh whether to re-sign their contracts with Braintree following recent price changes. \"Investors are anxious about perceived market share loss and are worried Braintree will not pivot,\" Friedman says.
