The owner of Johnnie Walker, Guinness and Smirnoff reported a positive performance for the first half, ahead of market expectations. Meanwhile, full-year guidance reflects a sequential increase in organic sales growth and a slight decline in organic EBIT, the analysts write in a note. The guidance removal is welcome as it led to unrealistic investor expectations and sub-optimal management decisions designed to support an unfeasible growth aspiration. The target has been replaced by more comprehensive short-term guidance with the promise of improved productivity efforts and tighter capital discipline, they say. Shares are down 2.7% and nearly 20% over the 52-week period. (michael.susin@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">Diageo's Performance Seen as Positive, Guidance Withdraw Acceptable</p><p class=\"\">0853 GMT - Diageo's 1H performance was satisfactory and likely exceeded market expectations, with signs of stabilization as sales were up by 1% and profits down by 1%, Quilter Cheviot's Chris Beckett says. Diageo's decision to remove medium-term guidance of 5%-7% organic sales growth might upset some investors. However, this move is acceptable given that the target was laid during the pandemic--when demand for alcohol was exceptionally high--and unrealistic given the current environment, Beckett writes in a note. Additionally, the owner of Johnnie Walker, Guinness and Smirnoff seems to be effectively managing its significant debt, given that the dividend remained unchanged amid concerns of a potential cut, Beckett says. Diageo's 2H performance is likely to be similar if U.S. tariffs are not imposed, he adds. Shares are down 3.3% and nearly 20% over the last 52 weeks. (michael.susin@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">Diageo's Results Show Progress But U.S. Tariffs Remain a Question Mark</p><p class=\"\">0958 GMT - Diageo's first-half results show consistent progress, mostly in line with the company's guidance and market expectations, but uncertainty remains in the U.S., Stifel analyst Cedric Lecasble says in a research note. The U.K. spirits maker booked net sales of $10.90 billion in the six months to Dec. 31, up 1% organically on year. \"Meeting expectations in this dull environment is an already solid performance, but U.S. tariffs remain the main question mark,\" he says. The analyst welcomed the group's decision to withdraw its medium-term outlook of organic net sales growth between 5% and 7%, as the target seemed more and more challenging in the current environment. Shares are down 3.7% at 22.78 pounds. (andrea.figueras@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">Diageo's Prospects Are a Glass Half Empty</p><p class=\"\">1041 GMT - Diageo faces a testing time, and its challenges are leading to a pessimistic outlook, says Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor. The U.K. distiller withdrew its midterm guidance of organic net sales growth between 5% and 7%. It also said it had expected to build on the momentum seen during the first half, but that the application of tariffs in the U.S. could affect this goal. The fact that Diageo imports an estimated 40% of its products for sale in the U.S. from Mexico and Canada is a significant overhang, Hunter says in a note. The products that are most affected by tariffs are tequila and Canadian whisky, which could leave the group with little option but to hike prices at a time when discretionary spend is under pressure, he says. Shares are down 0.7% at 23.48 pounds. (andrea.figueras@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">Diageo Starts 2025 on Back Foot, AJ Bell Says</p><p class=\"\">1334 GMT - Diageo has had little to toast so far in 2025, AJ Bell's Russ Mould says in a note. First the calls from U.S. surgeon general for warnings about the health impacts of alcohol consumption and now it has withdrawn its medium-term guidance. The Guinness beer owner scrapped its midterm outlook of organic net sales growth of between 5% and 7%, citing uncertainty in key markets. The company said U.S. tariffs would affect the Mexican tequila and Canadian whisky it sells in the U.S. AJ Bell's investment director says the group will be relieved to see the imposition of tariffs for these two countries delayed for now, as imports from these countries account for a good chunk of Diageo's U.S. sales.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">SAN MATEO, Calif., Feb.  04, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Model N, the leader in revenue optimization and compliance for life sciences and high-tech companies, published its seventh annual State of Revenue Report, highlighting how executives in these industries are transforming their revenue operations. The report reveals that while 87% of industry leaders are shifting toward automated revenue management operations, nearly 60% still rely on multiple solutions. Additionally, 62% are using or planning to implement generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) for revenue optimization activities, including deal analytics, process automation, and forecasting. </p><p class=\"\">This gap between automation goals and system integration presents both a challenge and an opportunity. The research found that companies with more than 10,000 employees are 51% more likely than smaller organizations to use a unified revenue management solution.  </p><p class=\"\">“Life sciences and high-tech manufacturers are using advanced technologies to automate and optimize revenue operations with data-driven insights,” said Suresh Kannan, Model N Chief Product Officer. “This year’s State of Revenue Report highlights the value of integrating GenAI for revenue management and transitioning to a unified solution. By harnessing AI and consolidating platforms, organizations can unlock greater revenue optimization opportunities, boost efficiency, and drive growth.” </p><p class=\"\">Life Sciences Executives Focus on Regulatory Readiness and AI Adoption </p><p class=\"\">Pharmaceutical companies are modernizing their revenue management approach to navigate a complex regulatory landscape. Pricing strategy is pharmaceutical leaders’ highest priority for revenue management-related strategic investment over the next two years. Eighty-seven percent of leaders report that they have already adjusted their launch plans in response to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).</p><p class=\"\">State-level regulations like price transparency mandates and affordability boards are also a significant focus, with 76% of leaders concerned about how the regulatory changes may impact revenue management. Automation and technology, including GenAI, are key enablers, with 62% of pharmaceutical companies using or planning to use GenAI to strengthen revenue operations. </p><p class=\"\">The medtech sector is undergoing a similar transformation. Regulatory changes like healthcare price transparency (45%) and the European Union’s implementation of the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) (40%) top the list of impacts on revenue programs. Nearly two-thirds of medtech companies are already seeing shifts as AI and automation are integrated into healthcare operations, and leaders are beginning to incorporate these approaches into their own company’s revenue optimization and compliance processes. Looking ahead, 38% of leaders are focusing on adapting to value-based care models, expecting further impacts on revenue optimization functions. </p><p class=\"\">High-Tech Manufacturers Strengthen Channel Intelligence</p><p class=\"\">High-tech companies are advancing their use of channel data – in fact, 87% regularly use channel sales data to inform price management and optimization processes. This industry leads in applying new technology to business processes, with 74% of high-tech manufacturers planning to implement GenAI solutions – the highest rate across industries surveyed in the State of Revenue Report.</p><p class=\"\">Supply chain disruption continues to influence strategy, prompting 53% of companies to diversify suppliers, 51% to deploy new technologies, and half to implement sustainability initiatives. Additionally, 95% of high-tech leaders express concerns about grey market sales, implementing measures such as removing unauthorized sellers and enhanced contract enforcement.</p><p class=\"\">For more specific information about revenue optimization in life sciences and high-tech, download the full 2025 State of Revenue Report.</p><p class=\"\">###</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">More About the 2025 State of Revenue Report</strong></p><p class=\"\">This report, commissioned by Model N with research conducted by Dimensional Research, is based on the results of a survey of more than 400 strategy and finance, operations, and technology leaders who are directly responsible for revenue management at large pharmaceutical, medical technology, high-tech, or semiconductor and electronic component manufacturers. </p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Model N</strong></p><p class=\"\">Model N is the leader in revenue optimization and compliance for pharmaceutical, medtech and high-tech innovators.

Recipients leverage their talents and resources to elevate the standard of excellence in health care available to our nation’s Veterans.</p><p class=\"\">LTG (Ret) Patricia “Patty” D. Horoho was the 43rd United States Army Surgeon General and the Commander of the U.S. Army Medical Command. She made history as the first woman, first nurse and non-physician to hold these posts. In these roles, General Horoho led the world’s third-largest health care system with a multi-billion-dollar budget, a staff of 156,000 and a global logistics, research and care network that spanned five continents.</p><p class=\"\">In 2017, she was chosen to establish and lead Optum Serve, the end-to-end federal business of both Optum and UnitedHealth Group. Her role has expanded to include leading Optum Health Solutions, and she was later appointed as Chief Strategy, Innovation and Transformation Officer for Optum Health.</p><p class=\"\">She established the 2Serve Together Foundation in 2023, a nonprofit dedicated to empowering and recognizing military women by providing them with opportunities to share their individual stories, or simply put, to say “Thank you for your service.” This initiative was inspired by her late father, Lieutenant Colonel (Ret) Frank J. Dallas, a Veteran of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam.</p><p class=\"\">“SoldierStrong is honored to recognize LTG (Ret) Patty Horoho with our individual 2024 Commitment to Service Award. Her work within the Veteran community and continued support of SoldierStrong have demonstrated her unwavering dedication to service, healthcare, mental health and Veterans,” said SoldierStrong co-founder and chairman Dr. Chris Meek. “I’ve always admired a sentiment attributed to General Horoho: ‘It’s wonderful to be the first, but you are committed to seeing that you’re not the last.’ Her career has been one of trailblazing, not just for herself, but for other women, particularly servicewomen, who have followed in her footsteps. General Horoho's leadership and impact continue to inspire, and her legacy serves as a beacon for all those who strive to serve with excellence, compassion, and vision.”</p><p class=\"\">“It is deeply humbling to be named the 2024 recipient of the SoldierStrong Commitment to Service Award, and I am truly grateful for this prestigious recognition,” said General Horoho. “SoldierStrong’s dedication to serving those who have sacrificed greatly for our democracy and our freedom is both inspiring and critical. I am delighted to be recognized by an organization that embodies the power of service, sacrifice and compassion that allows our Veterans to thrive with the dignity and respect they so richly deserve. It is a privilege to be part of this important work, and I look forward to continuing our collaboration with SoldierStrong.”</p><p class=\"\">Founded in 1989, the Bobby Rahal Automotive Group is a 13-dealership group in central and western Pennsylvania that represents the Acura, BMW, Honda, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lexus, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, and Volvo brands. For eight consecutive years the group has donated a share of the revenue from every new and used vehicle sold at its central Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh region dealerships to SoldierStrong during the month of November in recognition of Veterans Day.</p><p class=\"\">Under the leadership of founder and chairman of the board Bobby Rahal, 1986 Indianapolis 500 winner and three-time CART champion, the Bobby Rahal Automotive Group is extensively involved in community programs and charitable organizations within the communities they serve. To date, they have contributed over $1 million in charitable funds to numerous organizations, including more than $260,000 in donations to SoldierStrong.</p><p class=\"\">“The Bobby Rahal Automotive Group’s commitment to charitable causes is second to none,” said Meek. “Recognizing Rahal Automotive with our corporate Commitment to Service Award serves as a testament to the selfless generosity their team continues to show by having the backs of those servicemen and women who have had our backs on the battlefield and beyond. Their ability to rally communities around life-changing causes is an example of benevolence, leadership and doing the right thing for all Americans to look up to.”</p><p class=\"\">“It is truly an honor to receive SoldierStrong’s Commitment to Service Award. It is our privilege to assist in efforts to bring cutting-edge medical devices and technology to improve the daily lives of the brave men and women who have selflessly served to protect and defend our country and its citizens,” said Harrisburg Area Bobby Rahal Automotive Group President, Brad Lee. “The SoldierStrong mission aligns perfectly with our core value and belief that involvement in the communities we serve is imperative and contributes to the growth and welfare of both the public and our company.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About SoldierStrong: </strong>Since 2009, SoldierStrong has assisted America’s military veterans in taking their next steps forward in life after service. Our mission is fully realized through the donation of revolutionary medical technology to Veterans Affairs medical facilities and individual veterans across the country.
