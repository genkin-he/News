The snack maker's 2025 outlook was more disappointing than expected, with adjusted earnings per share set to fall 10%. Underlying sales growth remains solid across regions, despite cocoa prices pulling down operating income across the globe by 28%. Mondelez said in an earnings call it plans to raise prices, but low-cost distribution will be especially crucial for emerging international markets as the company generates about 70% of its sales outside of North America, Quatrochi says. Shares rise 1.7%. (katherine.hamilton@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1127 ET - Livestock futures on the CME are higher, with live cattle up 1.5% and lean hogs up 1.4%. Both are getting support from strength in cutout prices, both for boxed beef and for pork cutouts. For cattle, traders are grasping a tight supply/demand dynamic for cows and lean beef extending into 2025, while for hogs traders are noticing 'better' fundamentals, StoneX says in a note. \"Spot fundamentals continue to feel a bit better dating back a couple weeks,\" the firm says. \"Production rates noted Monday still fall a touch short of expected and we're into a timeslot now where the cutout and cash hog markets normally trend firmer anyway.\" (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1124 ET - Mondelez International expects adjusted earnings per share to fall 10% in 2025 due to elevated cocoa costs, after the snack maker said operating income declined 28% in the fourth quarter primarily due to that inflation. If chocolate costs remain high, Mondelez plans to gradually increase prices in the second half of this year, especially in developed markets, but the company said consumer confidence is still rocky, which could pose challenges to its pricing plan. Chief financial officer Luca Zaramella said he expects earnings per share to grow again in 2026, either from price increases or cocoa costs normalizing. (katherine.hamilton@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1047 ET - Shares of grain merchant and oilseed processor Bunge were down about 6% after the company reported a lower quarterly profit that missed analyst expectations because of supply gluts for crops and the meal and oil they are processed into. Bunge CEO told analysts on a call that the future for the agriculture market is hard to predict given the Trump Administration's threats of trade wars and what will happen to the U.S.' biofuels policies that drive the industry. \"We definitely are in an environment has less visibility than the normal with the trade disruptions and some of the uncertainty around U.S. biofuels,\" Heckman said. He added that the company's proposed acquisition of rival trader Viterra will help it weather any trade fights by increasing the company's ability to source crops from around the world. (patrick.thomas@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1034 ET - As the U.S. and Mexico grapple over tariff threats, Mexico is continuing to purchase U.S. corn exports — with the USDA confirming sales of 330,000 metric tons of corn for delivery to Mexico during the 2025/26 marketing year. Corn and soybean futures on the CBOT are lower in early trading, with the last-minute nature of agreements to delay implementing tariffs keeping investors in markets on edge. \"[His] eleventh-hour decision to delay the 25% tariffs he had threatened to impose on Canada and Mexico is a good reminder of his unpredictable nature,\" says Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics in a note, adding that the firm expects the Trump administration to move forward on a 10% universal tariff, as well as higher tariffs on Chinese goods. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0942 ET - U.S. farmers may see a significant price hike for fertilizer if Trump tariffs are implemented, as the materials used for fertilizer are often imported into the U.S, says Farmdoc Daily in a note. Potassium-based fertilizers may take the brunt, as 90% of U.S. consumption of potassium comes from imports. Canada is the leading producer of potash globally, and a tariff could add over $100 per ton for U.S. farmers to the current price tag around $450 a ton, says Farmdoc. Nitrogen fertilizers would also be impacted, although imports account for far less consumption, according to data from the U.S. Geological Survey. Nitrogen fertilizers are the most important for U.S. corn, while U.S. soybeans are often grown using potassium-based products. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0925 ET - Shifting weather forecasts continue to buffet U.S. natural gas futures, which are adding modestly to yesterday's losses. \"Winter is not yet over,\" EBW Analytics says in a note. \"The near term may see mild weather and bearish risks for Thursday's EIA report-but a subsequent bounce is probable.\" Colder temperatures ahead coupled with a storage deficit are bullish, while medium-term, higher production should be a counterweight, the firm adds. Nymex natural gas is off 0.7% at $3.229/mmBtu. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0921 ET - U.S. ag traders are taking the lack of retaliatory tariffs from China on U.S. grain exports as a sign that a window for negotiations is open--but the lack of urgency coming from President Trump about negotiating with Chinese President Xi has grain traders nervous. \"Uncertain trade policy between the world's largest soybean importer and the world's second largest soybean exporter are in full display,\" says AgResource in a note. CBOT soybean futures are down 0.6% premarket. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0857 ET - Gold futures rise, keeping close to a fresh record set earlier in the session. Futures rise 0.2% to $2,880.80 a troy ounce, having hit $2,901.50 earlier in the day. Investors are increasingly seeking safe-haven in hard assets like gold, silver, copper and platinum, historically viewed as stores of value in times of financial uncertainty, Saxo Bank's Ole Hansen says in a note. The risk of sovereign debt crises, currency devaluations and systemic financial instability could further reinforce this trend, increasing the attractiveness of metals as a hedge against economic turbulence, Hansen writes. A shift away from U.S. dollar dominance is also underway as nations seek to reduce their greenback reliance for trade and reserve holdings, Hansen says. This is further supporting demand for gold and other stable commodities, as countries seek alternative to fiat currencies, he adds. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0847 ET - Oil futures are losing ground after an industry report of a large build in U.S. crude stocks, while the prospect of a trade war fuels concerns about demand. \"All of this tariff talk and general confusion that it's generating is bearish demand as companies can't expand if they don't know what their costs are or what they can sell their goods for,\" Scott Shelton of TP ICAP says in a note. The API reported a 5 million barrel increase in U.S. stocks for last week, analysts note. EIA data inventory are due later this morning, with a Wall Street Journal survey predicting a 1.3 million barrel build. WTI is off 1% at $71.97 a barrel and Brent is down 1.1% at $75.38 a barrel. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)Chinese retaliatory tariffs won't be implemented until Feb. 10. \"Base Metal Prices Mixed as Trade Tensions Continue to Unnerve Market — Market Talk,\" at 0951 GMT, incorrectly said U.S. tariffs won't be implemented until Feb. 10.</p><p class=\"\">0606 ET - Gold futures rise, holding ground after setting a fresh record earlier in the session. Futures are up 0.6% at $2,892.70 a troy ounce, having reached $2,901.50 an ounce earlier in the day. The precious metal is gaining on a weaker U.S. dollar and growing concerns of an escalating U.S.-China trade war, and the likely hit to global economic growth prospects, ActivTrades' Ricardo Evangelista says in a note. The weaker dollar follows President Trump's last minute U-turn on imposing additional tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and disappointing U.S. labor and industrial data, Evangelista writes. At the same time, U.S. tariffs on China--and Beijing's response--are ominous for the global economy, increasing gold's safe-haven appeal. Demand is reinforced by further Middle East uncertainty, after Trump's comments about taking over Gaza and displacing the Palestinian population, Evangelista adds.

In its case, the Corporation has for many years adroitly staggered the arrivals and exits of its most senior leaders to avoid disruption and maintain an inviolable continuity of purpose.</p><p class=\"\">Until now, that is.</p><p class=\"\">Last week’s news that Lloyd’s CFO Burkhard Keese will shortly return to Germany was the latest in a flurry of unexpected exits from the Corporation’s executive team. The question is what has caused this trend and is it a problem?</p><p class=\"\">Keese’s imminent departure (he will join German MGA Konzept &amp; Marketing on 1 May) follows the announcement last month that CEO John Neal will take up the vacant position as Aon’s global reinsurance head, and comes during a handover period for the next Lloyd’s chairman with Bruce Carnegie-Brown retiring in May after almost nine years at One Lime Street.</p><p class=\"\">Nor are these the only notable changes on the executive floor. In August 2024, Lloyd’s COO Bob James was parachuted into the London market joint venture Velonetic to directly oversee Neal’s delayed Blueprint Two modernisation project, with the vacancy since filled on an interim basis by Accenture’s AI specialist George Marcotte. </p><p class=\"\">The Corporation – the body tasked with managing the near-350-year-old market – has not experienced this level of executive turnover since at least the Lloyd's Act of 1982 and perhaps even since Edward Lloyd began percolating his coffee. It is even possible four of the five most senior Corporation leaders will have changed in under a year – assuming Neal is released early from his 12-month rolling contract to avoid any tensions emerging from his next destination (no details have been released on his leaving date – another sign, perhaps, that his departure was unexpected).</p><p class=\"\">The only constant is chief of markets Patrick Tiernan, who has returned to his post after a brief health-related absence last year. However, even that position may become vacant later this year if he is successful in his ambition to succeed Neal as CEO.</p><p class=\"\">It is certainly a far cry from the previous model of stable succession planning. Since 2000, for example, Lloyd’s has had only four chairmen (Sax Riley, Lord Levene, John Nelson and Carnegie-Brown), four CEOs (Nick Prettejohn, Richard Ward, Dame Inga Beale and Neal), four underwriting heads (Rolf Tolle, Tom Bolt, Jon Hancock and Tiernan) and five CFOs (Bob Hewes, Andrew Moss, Luke Savage, John Parry and Keese). As the timeline below demonstrates, their arrivals and departures were managed to ensure continuity of senior leadership. In any one year between 2000-2024, only one of the top four executives left. Only rarely – such as when Hancock left in 2020 for AIG – was there a significant hiatus before a replacement was announced.</p><p class=\"\">In one sense, we shouldn’t be too surprised. Under Neal’s stewardship, there appears to have been a marked increase in the turnover of Corporation senior staff. This is perhaps natural at the beginning of a CEO’s tenure – however, in Neal’s case it seemed more of a continual theme. 2023, for example, saw the sudden departure of two members of the Corporation’s managerial ranks: long-serving general counsel Peter Spires and marketing and communications head Jo Scott. Both were effectively replaced by junior Corporation colleagues (albeit Scott temporarily remained with a reduced role overseeing charitable donations) who were assumed to be closer to Neal. James – another trusted Neal lieutenant from his time at QBE – was elevated to the vacant COO role following the exit of Jennifer Rigby the previous year.</p><p class=\"\">Does all this turnover matter? </p><p class=\"\">On the face of it, the Lloyd’s market is in rude health. In March, the Corporation is expected to announce another set of strong underwriting results for the ~100 syndicates that trade on the platform. Keese’s successor has already been identified in the form of his number two, Alexandra Cliff. Lloyd’s remains an attractive place to access wholesale and specialty business and the queue of aspiring entrants is said to remain healthy. Of course, rate pressures are growing in many classes but there is no sign yet of a return to the soft market nadir of 2016-2018. The venerable ship – which celebrates its 350th anniversary next decade – is back on course after the traumatic underwriting losses of 2017-19.</p><p class=\"\">But the vicissitudes of the risk business means the waters rarely stay calm for long – as we were reminded in California only last month. Catastrophic loss events – as well as geopolitical and economic storms – occur too frequently to indulge a leadership vacuum for long at a marketplace as important as Lloyd’s.</p><p class=\"\">However, the uncertainty of when Neal will go – and who will replace him – is complicated by the impending exit of his chairman. This departure was at least planned. Carnegie-Brown’s final term of office expires in the summer and his successor, the former McKinsey senior partner and civil servant Sir Charles Roxburgh, was identified last year following a thorough process.</p><p class=\"\">However, the sudden announcement of Neal’s departure has created a dilemma. Will it be Carnegie-Brown or Roxburgh who ultimately decides Neal’s leaving date? The situation is complicated by Neal’s decision to join Aon, one of the market’s largest and most influential producers. The longer he stays, the more Lloyd’s will have to tread carefully in decisions that affect Aon’s competitors to avoid any accusations of favouritism. If he goes prematurely, Lloyd’s may need to find an interim replacement – which could also affect the process to select a permanent successor.</p><p class=\"\">Committed, long-term leadership is also required to address two of the more vexatious issues during Neal’s tenure: modernisation and culture. The former hinges on Blueprint Two, which has likely cost more than all the infamous Lloyd’s white elephants of the past – such as Kinnect and TOM – combined. Neal and Carnegie-Brown are leaving with no official costings to date published, but there are fears it exceeds £500mn all in along with continued concerns over its delivery. Should it be shelved? </p><p class=\"\">Surely not, but a clear pathway of deliverable success needs to be presented to the market following the tensions that emerged last year between the influential trade body, the Lloyd’s Market Association, and Neal. This can’t be delayed for much longer.</p><p class=\"\">On culture, Lloyd’s has recently closed a market consultation on toughening its investigation powers following the failures of the Atrium/Richard Tomlin affair. </p><p class=\"\">Neal positioned himself as a reforming culture crusader during his time at Lloyd’s. Politically, this was smart considering the damaging Bloomberg investigation alleging widespread sexual harassment shortly after he arrived. </p><p class=\"\">But the delivery didn’t always appear consistent. </p><p class=\"\">Atrium was hit with a record £1mn fine and an exposé of a “boys' night out” culture, while a few years later CFC Underwriting was allowed to discreetly change its senior management and avoid any embarrassing revelations of its own culture shortcomings. </p><p class=\"\">Closer to home, Lloyd’s quietly parted ways with a number of unnamed executives in its performance directorate in 2022 following suggestions of whistleblower complaints relating to conduct and behaviour. Shouldn’t this also have been subject to the cleansing light of transparency? And what of the Corporation’s apparent deteriorating performance in the most recent annual market culture survey?</p><p class=\"\">This is all on Neal’s watch rather than his yet-to-be found successor, but someone still has to decide whether to proceed with the proposed tougher rules despite concerns – likely to have been echoed in the consultation – that they may result in regulatory over-reach and potential injustice. Should this be an exiting chairman and CEO or the new leadership team? Surely the latter.</p><p class=\"\">In summary, it’s been a month since the market was blindsided by the news of Neal’s resignation. This – together with the chairman handover process – no doubt explains the delay in announcing an agreed exit date. But Lloyd’s needs to resolve the current leadership limbo swiftly. Once achieved, perhaps it also makes sense for the Corporation to return to the policy of stable succession planning…</p><p class=\"\">In response to some of the points raised in this article, a Lloyd's spokesperson said: “Lloyd’s executive committee remain aligned on the Corporation’s strategy for 2025 and on the execution and delivery against the key priorities of performance; digitalisation; purpose and culture.</p><p class=\"\">“Following John Neal’s decision to step down as CEO of Lloyd’s in 2025, a rigorous process to recruit has successor is now underway. A formal departure date will be agreed in due course, and John will work with incoming chair Charles Roxburgh and Lloyd’s executive committee to ensure a smooth transition.</p><p class=\"\">“Alex Cliff will take over from Burkhard Keese, following his decision to step down as CFO at the end of April as part of a well-executed succession plan. She is a well-known member of the leadership team and well-respected deputy CFO, having been at Lloyd’s for over three years.”</p></span></div>",

We achieved organic growth of 35 percent for the full year. I am pleased to see that our performance has been strong in all the categories we operate in, and that we have grown in all the geographies we sell to.</p><p class=\"\">In the Sports and Motorcycle categories, we are now seeing a more normalized market situation. In these categories, where we have strong customer awareness, our focus is to drive increased penetration by equipping more helmet models from more helmet brands with Mips solutions. The rate of implementation of Mips technology in new helmets was the highest ever this year. Furthermore, we are still seeing great interest from our customers in all three of our categories in implementing Mips’ safety system, also in the Safety category, which is significantly less mature in terms of implementing our type of solutions.</p><p class=\"\">We have experienced that helmet inventory levels have largely normalized this year, and a lot of our growth is due to our customers once again starting to order products from us, rather than taking from their own stocks. We believe this will continue to contribute to our growth in 2025. The fourth quarter was our best quarter ever in the Safety category. This year we have almost doubled the number of helmet models on the market and have substantially strengthened our position in this category.</p><p class=\"\">The increase in net sales that we saw this quarter has led to a considerable improvement in profitability compared to the same quarter last year. Operating profit improved by 260 percent to SEK 62m (17) this quarter, and the operating margin thereby improved to 43 percent (19). Looking at the entire year, operating profit has increased from SEK 70m to SEK 174m, and the operating margin has improved, reaching 36 percent (20). The operating cash flow amounted to SEK 87m (31) in the quarter, and for the full year the cash flow was SEK 142m (11).</p><p class=\"\">The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of SEK 6.50 (6.00) per share for 2024, which corresponds to 122 percent of net earnings for the year. This well exceeds our target of distributing more than 50 percent of our net earnings.</p><p class=\"\">Sustainability - continued focus on delivering against our long-term targets</p><p class=\"\">In terms of our work with sustainability, we continued our journey towards our long-term goals this year. One of our targets was to reduce Mips’ carbon dioxide emissions by 8 percent per solution sold this year, and we managed to deliver a total reduction of 18 percent. The second target was to expand the third-party auditing of our supply chain, and we have now audited five of our largest manufacturing suppliers and thus delivered on our target. Our third target was to increase the use of recycled materials in Mips’ solutions by at least 10 percent, and we have successfully achieved an increase of 16 percent.</p><p class=\"\">Helmet category Sports – strong progress in all sub-categories</p><p class=\"\">We achieved growth of 56 percent in the Sports helmet category this quarter, and for the fifth quarter in a row we delivered growth in the bike sub-category, Mips’ largest sub-category. Global inventory levels are now at a healthier level than during the very turbulent years following the pandemic. This does not mean that all inventory levels have now completely normalized though, and many retailers are still trying to come to terms with an unfavorable product mix.</p><p class=\"\">According to current market data for the bike market in North America, there is a shift in the trend and volumes in the quarter have started to grow again compared to last year. Looking at the entire year, volumes are still down however positive to note is that the market recovery has begun. We are seeing a recovery in Europe where there is growth in many markets once again. However, it is important to remember that there are relatively weak comparative figures for this market as European consumers have faced a challenging situation in recent years. The high levels of inventory that followed the pandemic have made many helmet brands cautious about new product launches. It will therefore be interesting to see how all the new helmet models are received when they are launched during the upcoming season.</p><p class=\"\">Helmet category Motorcycle – strong growth in the quarter</p><p class=\"\">In the Motorcycle helmet category we delivered sales growth of 57 percent for the quarter, and growth of 25 percent for the full year. We are happy to see that the inventory situation has normalized, and also that the initiatives we launched have had the desired effect. As in the Sports category, growth has primarily been driven by customers buying from us again rather than focusing on reducing their inventories, coupled with market launches of new helmet models equipped with Mips’ safety system.</p><p class=\"\">Our assessment is that the market has recovered substantially during this recent period, but we are still seeing a challenging consumer market and do not expect the general market situation in the Motorcycle category as a whole to materially contribute to our growth journey in the short term. Our growth will mainly be driven by taking greater market share and the roll-out of new helmet models equipped with Mips’ technology.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Helmet category Safety – best quarter so far</strong></p><p class=\"\">We delivered our best quarter so far in the Safety helmet category and we saw good growth of 119 percent. Growth for the full year was 55 percent in this category.</p><p class=\"\">During the quarter we launched a new partnership, and a new helmet equipped with Mips technology, with the HexArmor brand in the US. HexArmor is an innovative, driven helmet producer in the American market and we look forward to seeing how the helmet will be received. Through this launch we have sharpened our offering even further, and it will be exciting to follow developments in 2025. While larger volume sales with selected helmet brands have been slightly slower than we had hoped, we are delighted to see that growth has now taken off and we remain very positive about this category over the long term.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Continued normalization of inventory levels</strong></p><p class=\"\">Progress was strong in the fourth quarter. I am pleased that all of our sub-categories and geographies grew during the quarter. During the quarter, it has been exciting to see the shift in trends that has occurred in the important American market after a challenging period. Our customers are still showing plenty of interest in developing new helmets equipped with Mips’ safety system in all three categories, and the number of completed helmets developed with our technology is the highest ever.</p><p class=\"\">The new American president has now taken office, and it remains to be seen how his administration will affect the business relationships with international companies and the geopolitical landscape. Mips sells all products based on Incoterms Ex Works, which means that the buyer takes responsibility for transport costs, fees, taxes, tariffs and so on.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Updated long-term financial target</strong></p><p class=\"\">We remain confident in the strategic plan communicated at our Capital Markets Day in June 2022. The plan is built on three strategic pillars to 1) grow the existing business, 2) open up new channels and markets and 3) capture new opportunities within helmet safety.</p><p class=\"\">We see that we have successfully continued to gain market share and increase the penetration of the number of helmet models equipped with Mips’ technology among our customers through our market-leading safety solution.</p><p class=\"\">After summarizing the year, we have assessed the possibilities of reaching our financial targets by 2027. We have seen that it has taken longer for both the retail chain and helmet manufacturers to normalize their inventory levels than expected in connection with our Capital Markets Day. This, together with a relatively uncertain consumer market, geopolitical uncertainty and a new administration in the important US market, means that our new assessment is that we will reach our net sales target of &gt;SEK 2 billion no later than 2029, which is two years later than the target communicated in 2022. Our long-term profitability target and dividend target communicated in 2022 remain unchanged. This means that our financial targets now are:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Net sales &gt;SEK 2 billion no later than 2029 (previously 2027)</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">EBIT margin &gt;50% (no change)</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">&gt;50% dividend of annual net earnings (no change)</li></ul><p class=\"\">We will continue to grow our business with our strong market position in the helmet sector, our broad expertise and our patented technology. We will also continue to invest in research and development and in our brand to achieve our ambition.</p><p class=\"\">Stockholm, February 2025</p><p class=\"\">Max Strandwitz</p><p class=\"\">President and CEO</p></span></div>",

However, despite great progress during the last years in winning market shares with our leading offers for helmet safety, we have seen that the overall helmet market has taken longer to return to normal purchasing patterns than expected at the time when we set our financial targets. <!-- -->Based on this, together with a relatively uncertain consumer market, geopolitical uncertainty and a new administration in the important US market, we have decided to retain our sales target at SEK 2 billion but now with the ambition to reach that target no later than 2029 (previously 2027). Our financial targets for profitability and dividend remain unchanged. We will continue to grow our business with our strong market position in the helmet sector, our broad expertise and our patented technology. We will also continue to invest in research and development and in our brand to achieve our ambition”, says Max Strandwitz, Mips’ CEO and President.</p><p class=\"\">A presentation of the results for January - December 2024 will, as previously communicated, be held through a conference call tomorrow on 6 February 2025 at 10.00am CET.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">NEW YORK, NY / ACCESS Newswire / February 5, 2025 / <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">NEW YORK, NY /</strong> <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">ACCESS Newswire</strong> <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">/ February 5, 2025 /</strong> Buying a car can be complicated because it requires a buyer to make several decisions, like which make and model to go with and choosing between dealer financing or a personal loan to buy a car. Although the car-buying process can be exciting, there are potential pitfalls that car buyers can sometimes fall into. Below is a list of dos and don'ts to simplify the car-buying experience.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">What to do when buying a car</strong></p><p class=\"\">Potential car buyers can shop online, go to an auto dealership, or browse classified ads that list new and used vehicles. In every case, the following steps should be taken once a borrower finds a car they love.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Look up the book value</strong>: The sticker price on the car is not the book value of the vehicle. That can be found by researching vehicle valuation websites. Another number to look for is the fair market value, which may vary slightly from the book value. Either number can be the starting place for price negotiations.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Add up the cost of ownership:</strong> The cost of ownership comes after the car's initial purchase. It includes loan payments, interest, insurance, gas, maintenance, and other miscellaneous expenses. Affordability is determined by this cost, not whether the buyer can come up with a down payment on the purchase date.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Get pre-approved before going to the dealership:</strong> Pre-approval from a bank or online lender gives the buyer a better understanding of their budget and prevents them from falling in love with a car that is out of their price range. It can also give the buyer negotiating power at the dealership. With a set interest rate and loan amount, the buyer can negotiate a better price for the vehicle.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Always test-drive the vehicle:</strong> A potential car buyer should never purchase a vehicle without test-driving it first. It's best to bring a mechanic along to evaluate the car on the spot. If that's not possible, the buyer should use their best instincts and take the vehicle in for a full mechanical checkup within a few days after purchasing.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Be prepared to walk away</strong>: Auto dealerships are notorious for hiring high-pressure salespeople to close deals. A buyer should be prepared to walk away if the deal doesn't seem right or doesn't fall in line with their budget.</p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">What not to do when buying a car</strong></p><p class=\"\">The \"don'ts\" of car buying occur primarily in the negotiation stage. The following actions should be avoided if the buyer wants the best price on a new or used vehicle.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Don't buy based on price alone</strong>: There's an old saying about getting what you pay for. Paying a little more for a better-quality vehicle is better than getting stuck with a lemon because the \"price was right.\"</p></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Don't give up your leverage during negotiations</strong>: A buyer should never tell a car salesperson what's in their budget or how much they want their monthly payment to be. That's giving up leverage during the negotiation process.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\">Don't agree to buy before all questions have been answered: It's best not to leave anything unsaid during the negotiation phase. Ask every relevant question, and don't sign the purchase agreement until all of them have been answered.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Don't go over budget:</strong> Buyers should never stretch their budget too far when buying a car. Not being able to afford the monthly car payments will create financial challenges in other areas. It's best to stick with what they can reasonably afford.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\">Don't rely only on dealer financing: Several financing options exist for buying a car. Dealer financing is only one of them. A loan from a lender other than the dealership might have better terms and a lower interest rate. So, shopping around before making the final decision is more beneficial.</p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">The Bottom Line</strong></p><p class=\"\">Always know the value of the vehicle being bought and how much it will cost to own. Test drive the vehicle before buying it and be prepared to walk away if the deal doesn't feel right. Don't buy based on price. Don't give up leverage in negotiations. Don't agree to buy a car when there are unanswered questions.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Sources:</strong></p><p class=\"\">https://www.gobankingrates.com/saving-money/car/biggest-dos-donts-when-buying-first-car/</p><p class=\"\">https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/advice/dos-and-donts-of-car-buying</p><p class=\"\">https://www.consumerreports.org/buying-a-car/dos-and-donts-when-buying-a-car-from-a-dealer-a5825423505/</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">SPONSORED CONTENT</strong></p><p class=\"\">About OneMain Financial</p><p class=\"\">View Website</p><p class=\"\">OneMain Financial is the leader in offering nonprime customers responsible access to credit and is dedicated to improving the financial well-being of hardworking Americans.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">CONTACT:</strong></p><p class=\"\">Sonakshi Murze</p><p class=\"\">Manager</p><p class=\"\">sonakshi.murze@iquanti.com</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">SOURCE:</strong> OneMain Financial</p><p class=\"\">View the original press release on ACCESS Newswire</p></span></div>",
