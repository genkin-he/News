Advertising revenue was up 32% on higher news ratings, prices and digital ad sales, along with higher ratings for Major League Baseball's postseason.</p><p class=\"\">The company's television segment logged 16% higher revenue thanks to the strong MLB ratings, higher prices for National Football League advertisements, political ads and growth for ad-supported video on demand at the Tubi subsidiary.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Joe Flint at Joe.Flint@wsj.com and Dean Seal at dean.seal@wsj.com</p></span></div>",

The right provider can help financial institutions meet customer expectations, streamline operations, and even expand issuance beyond traditional branches,” said Elisa Tavilla, Director of the Debit practice at Javelin. “Institutions should think beyond the status quo and consider vendors with innovative delivery models, including kiosks, ITMs, and mobile ordering capabilities.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Javelin Strategy &amp; Research </strong></p><p class=\"\">Javelin Strategy &amp; Research, part of the Escalent Group, helps its clients make informed decisions in a digital financial world.
