The Norwegian energy major's capital allocation plans assume a slowdown in organic offshore wind plans and a slowdown in onshore renewables, they say. Some of its low carbon solutions projects also appear to be slowing, they say. The results look like a slight beat to consensus at the net income level, but guidance for a $5 billion buyback in 2025 is slightly below the $6 billion expected. Total shareholder distributions of $9 billion marks a step down versus 2024 levels of $14.6 billion. \"We think there were some lofty expectations into the event around potential distributions.\" Shares trade 3.2% lower at 268.85 Norwegian kroner.
