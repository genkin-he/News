Net income decreased $438 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, year-over-year from $598 million, which included the release of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets of $485 million. Operating profit increased 29 percent to $207 million, or 9.0 percent of sales. The Company recorded $7 million in pre-tax charges within Other Items (see Corporate Information for additional details). Adjusted EBITDA increased three percent year-over-year to $302 million, or 13.1 percent of sales.</p><p class=\"\">Revenues for the full-year 2024 were $8.87 billion, an increase of $287 million from 2023. Net income for the full-year 2024 was $635 million, a decrease of $358 million from $993 million in 2023, which included the release of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets of $485 million. Operating profit increased 35 percent to $876 million, or 9.9 percent of sales for the full-year 2024. Adjusted EBITDA increased 11 percent to $1.11 billion or 12.5 percent of sales for the full-year 2024.</p><p class=\"\">\"NOV's fourth quarter rounded out a solid year during which we grew backlog and revenue, improved profitability, and generated substantial amounts of cash flow,\" stated Clay Williams, Chairman, President and CEO. \"Full-year revenues improved three percent with 38 percent Adjusted EBITDA flow through, and fully-diluted earnings were $1.60 per share. Our longer-cycle capital equipment businesses increased backlog by seven percent, driven by strong offshore production related demand, while market share gains from new, higher margin technologies and services continue to drive growth and improve profitability.</p><p class=\"\">\"Higher levels of profitability combined with normalization of the global supply chain and working capital enabled us to convert 86 percent of our Adjusted EBITDA into Free Cash Flow, and allowed us to increase our cash balance by $414 million and return $337 million in cash to our shareholders, or 41 percent of our Excess Free Cash Flow*. We remain committed to returning at least 50 percent of our Excess Free Cash Flow on an annual basis and expect to achieve that threshold for 2024 via a supplemental dividend in the first half of 2025.</p><p class=\"\">\"For 2025, we expect a more challenging macro environment and geopolitical uncertainties to result in flat-to-lower global industry activity. However, we expect that NOV's growing backlog of higher margin offshore production-related capital equipment, along with continued market adoption of its new technologies, will enable NOV to continue to improve profitability and generate healthy levels of cash flow through the year.\"</p><p class=\"\">Energy Products and Services</p><p class=\"\">Energy Products and Services generated revenues of $1.06 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease of one percent from the fourth quarter of 2023. Operating profit increased $18 million from the prior year to $112 million, or 10.6 percent of sales, and included $3 million in Other Items. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $20 million from the prior year to $173 million, or 16.3 percent of sales. The decrease in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to lower levels of global drilling activity, but this was partially offset by growing adoption of the Company's new technologically advanced product offerings.</p><p class=\"\">Energy Equipment</p><p class=\"\">Energy Equipment generated revenues of $1.29 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease of one percent from the fourth quarter of 2023. The decline in revenue was due primarily to the divestiture of the Company's Pole Products business in early 2024 and lower revenue from aftermarket support; however, this was mostly offset by higher revenue from the segment's growing backlog. Operating profit increased $31 million from the prior year to $152 million, or 11.8 percent of sales, and included $4 million in Other Items. Adjusted EBITDA increased $38 million from the prior year to $185 million, or 14.4 percent of sales. Profitability improved due to strong execution on higher margin projects from the segment's backlog.</p><p class=\"\">New orders booked during the quarter totaled $757 million, representing a book-to-bill of 121 percent when compared to the $628 million shipped from backlog. As of December 31, 2024, backlog for capital equipment orders for Energy Equipment was $4.43 billion, an increase of $279 million from the fourth quarter of 2023.</p><p class=\"\">First Quarter 2025 Outlook</p><p class=\"\">The Company is providing financial guidance for the first quarter of 2025. Guidance is based on current outlook and plans and is subject to a number of known and unknown uncertainties and risks and constitutes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as further described under the Cautionary Statement below. Actual results may differ materially from the guidance set forth below.</p><p class=\"\">For the first quarter of 2025 management expects year-over-year consolidated revenues to be down one to three percent with Adjusted EBITDA between $235 million and $265 million.</p><p class=\"\">Corporate Information</p><p class=\"\">NOV repurchased 7.5 million shares of common stock for $112 million during the fourth quarter. For the full year, the Company repurchased 14.2 million shares of common stock for an aggregate amount of $229 million. Including dividends, NOV returned $337 million in capital to shareholders during 2024. The Company expects to return at least 50 percent of Excess Free Cash Flow (defined as cash flows from operations less capital expenditures and other investments, including acquisitions and divestitures) through a combination of steady, quarterly base dividends, opportunistic stock buybacks, and a supplemental dividend to true-up returns to shareholders on an annual basis.</p><p class=\"\">During the fourth quarter of 2024, NOV recorded $7 million in Other Items, primarily related to severance and facility closure costs (see Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA).</p><p class=\"\">As of December 31, 2024, the Company had total debt of $1.74 billion, with $1.50 billion available on its primary revolving credit facility, and $1.23 billion in cash and cash equivalents.</p><p class=\"\">Significant Achievements</p><p class=\"\">NOV secured multiple orders for advanced gas processing and water treatment equipment packages on three newbuild floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) units destined for operations in Brazil and West Africa.

These non-GAAP financial measures are broadly used to value and compare companies in the oilfield services and equipment industry. Not all companies define these measures in the same way. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should therefore be considered only as supplemental to such GAAP financial measures. Additionally, Free Cash Flow and Excess Free Cash Flow do not represent the Company's residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as the calculation of these measures does not account for certain debt service requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures. Please see the attached schedules for reconciliations of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.</p><p class=\"\">This press release contains certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA. The Company has not provided a reconciliation of projected Adjusted EBITDA. Management cannot predict with a reasonable degree of accuracy certain of the necessary components of net income, such as other income (expense), which includes fluctuations in foreign currencies. As such, a reconciliation of projected net income to projected Adjusted EBITDA is not available without unreasonable effort. The actual amount of other income (expense), provision (benefit) for income taxes, equity income (loss) in unconsolidated affiliates, depreciation and amortization, and other amounts excluded from Adjusted EBITDA could have a significant impact on net income.</p><p class=\"\">Cautionary Statement for the Purpose of the \"Safe Harbor\" Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995</p><p class=\"\">Statements made in this press release that are forward-looking in nature are intended to be \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and may involve risks and uncertainties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements typically are identified by use of terms such as \"may,\" \"believe,\" \"plan,\" \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"should,\" \"forecast,\" and similar words, although some forward-looking statements are expressed differently. These statements may differ materially from the actual future events or results. Readers are referred to documents filed by NOV with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K, which identify significant risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
