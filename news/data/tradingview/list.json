CE calculates that the countermeasures target, at most, $20 billion of annual imports versus the more than $450 billion of Chinese goods in the crosshairs. China also announced nontariff moves, such as a probe into Google. For the most part, these are warnings that it will harm U.S. interests if needed but still give the option to walk the measures back, he says. Beijing presumably hopes it can reach a deal with Trump, but U.S.-China grievances run deep, making de-escalation challenging. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

(the “Company”)   (WKN:A402CQ) (FSE:3TZ)wishes to announce a significant extension to the Halo zone in drillhole QGQ24-18, which intersected 172.6 m (566.3 ft) of 0.43 g/t goldnear surface from a depth of 10.4 m (34.1 ft), including intersectionscontaining 26.3 m (86.3 ft) of 0.88 g/t gold and 20.0 m (65.6 ft) of1.17 g/t gold. Core recovery in the 26.3 m interval was only 47% (seeTable 1 below), which could result in overall lower values due to theloss of mineralized soft sulphide bearing, brecciated, fracturedand/or altered intervals. The 172.6 m intersection extends goldmineralization 60 m from the drill hole QGQ24-13 collar (see Figure 1enclosed and on the Company website www.goldencariboo.com), and extendsgold mineralization vertically by 125 m (410.1 ft) below surface,which returned up to 5.15 g/t gold in outcrop (see News Release dated December 3,2024 and Figure 2 enclosed). A deeperintersection of gold mineralization in QGQ24-18 was also encountered,which returned 19.22 m (63.1 m) of 0.45 g/t gold from 351.66 m (1153.7ft).</p><p class=\"\">Drill hole QGQ24-18, set up at an azimuth of035° and inclination of -45°, was the thirddrill hole completed following the Halo Discovery in holes QGQ24-13 to-15, with an objective to extend mineralization and enhance theunderstanding of the lithological, structural and vein geometries ofthe Discovery. Lithological contacts trend southeast with a steepsouthwest dip, while quartz-carbonate+/-pyrite veins with observedvisible gold occur both parallel and oblique to lithological contacts.Subsequent drill holes QGQ24-19 and QGQ24-20 were drilled in anortherly orientation in approximately 100 m step-outs to extend theHalo Discovery, have been previously announced to contain broad zonesof quartz veining with visible gold (see News Release dated November 26,2024), and assay results are pending.</p><p class=\"\">Golden Cariboo’s President and CEO, Frank Callaghan,stated “Drill hole QGQ24-18 represents another strong follow up tothe Discovery made this past summer, and reinforces our growingconfidence in the Halo zone’s potential. The broad intercepts ofgold mineralization, shallow overburden cover, shallow topography, andlocation approximately 4 kilometers from a major highway in centralBC, demonstrates the exceptional nature of this Discovery.”</p><p class=\"\">Table 1: Reported gold intercepts for QGQ24-18</p><div class=\"tableWrapper-pIO_GYwT\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td

These Miercom results validate our exceptional ability to not only accurately detect and block new malware and critical events, but also to provide the best cyber security product quality to customers, year after year.”</p><p class=\"\">This year, Miercom introduced an important firewall comparison to reflect the quality of cyber security products, by assessing their vulnerability to being hacked.

The other top cyber security vendors had 11, 16, and 21 KEVs.</p><p class=\"\">With the advent of the hybrid mesh firewall platforms, Miercom's 2025 security report has expanded to provide a holistic view of threat prevention across all three hybrid firewall use cases: On-premises, Cloud, and Firewall-as-a-Service (SSE/SASE).
