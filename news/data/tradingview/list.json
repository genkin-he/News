            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan</p><p class=\"\">As the week's tariff rollercoaster levels out a bit, Wall Street stocks are tilting lower again - clouded by a poor reception for Alphabet's results, lingering China tariff hike plans and fresh interest rate rise speculation in Japan.</p><p class=\"\">U.S. stock futures  were back in the red ahead of Wednesday's bell as shares in megacap Alphabet  plunged 7% overnight. The drop came amid doubts about the Google parent's cloud computing business, much like Microsoft last week, and anxiety about its huge investment in artificial intelligence - especially in the light of last week's DeepSeek news.</p><p class=\"\">Following the previous day's sideswipe from Beijing on an anti-monopoly probe into Google there, Alphabet said it would spend $75 billion on its AI buildout this year, 29% more than Wall Street expected, and it missed its cloud revenue target.</p><p class=\"\">Adding to the overnight pressure, shares in Advanced Micro Devices  fell 9% after the company's AI chip revenue failed to meet lofty expectations.</p><p class=\"\">With a deluge of earnings updates across the world this week, the news on global macro policy did not help either.</p><p class=\"\">Japan's yen  surged to its best levels of the year so far after domestic wage numbers rekindled talk of another Bank of Japan rate hike this year.</p><p class=\"\">Japan's December inflation-adjusted real wages rose 0.6% year-on-year thanks to a wintertime bonus bump, with government officials expressing optimism that wage hike momentum is growing.</p><p class=\"\">\"We will continue to raise interest rates and adjust the degree of monetary support, if underlying inflation accelerates toward 2% as we project,\" Kazuhiro Masaki, director-general of the BOJ's monetary affairs department, told parliament.</p><p class=\"\">As Chinese markets returned from the week-long lunar new year holiday, there was a lot to unpack - not least this week's 10% U.S. tariff hikes on Chinese imports, planned retaliation from Beijing by Feb. 10 and the DeepSeek AI developments.</p><p class=\"\">But both mainland China and Hong Kong stock indexes fell on Wednesday as prior day's hopes of a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping to avert the tariff war were doused. U.S. plans to slap tariffs on Canada and Mexico were postponed for a month this week after similar calls between Trump and the leaders of those countries.</p><p class=\"\">Trump said late on Tuesday he was in no hurry to speak to Xi. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters a Trump-Xi call still needed to be scheduled.</p><p class=\"\">EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS</p><p class=\"\">Adding to the tension, the U.S. Postal Service said it would temporarily suspend parcels from China and Hong Kong as Trump ended a trade provision this week used by retailers including Temu and Shein to ship low-value packages duty-free to America.</p><p class=\"\">And in the background, private sector business surveys showed China's services activity expanded at a slower pace in January, with the Lunar New Year holidays worsening employment.</p><p class=\"\">The currency reaction was a bit more mixed, however. While the onshore yuan , guided closely by the People's Bank of China, was reset slightly weaker after the holiday break, the offshore yuan  strengthened for the second day.</p><p class=\"\">The combination of yen and yuan gains weighed on the dollar index  more broadly.</p><p class=\"\">And a retreat in U.S. Treasury yields  dragged on the greenback to boot, with the 10-year slipping back below 4.5%.</p><p class=\"\">Treasury yields ebbed on a mix of trade war angst and the latest employment update, which showed U.S. job openings falling more than expected in December. That takes some of the perceived heat out of the labor market and allows more wiggle room for the Federal Reserve to keep easing policy.</p><p class=\"\">     \"I continue to see a gradual reduction in the level of monetary policy restraint placed on the economy as we move toward a more neutral stance,\" Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson said on Tuesday. \"That said, I do not think we need to be in a hurry to change our stance.\"</p><p class=\"\">Two Fed cuts this year are virtually fully priced for the year - resuming around mid-year.</p><p class=\"\">In a big week for employment numbers, private sector payrolls for January will be released by ADP later on Wednesday and the national payrolls report is due on Friday.</p><p class=\"\">Elsewhere, geopolitical tension added to trade war worries - with Trump's statement on the United States taking over Gaza confounding many who assumed he wanted to withdraw the country from foreign conflicts and remove expensive U.S. military and aid funds from around the world.</p><p class=\"\">Much like the puzzlement over similar contradictions in trade and currency policy, the statement left more confusion about the road ahead. </p><p class=\"\">Gold  seemed the only real beneficiary of the uncertainty and set another new record with gains of almost 10% for the year so far.</p><p class=\"\">In other corporate news, the Nikkei newspaper said Japan's Nissan  will call off merger talks with rival Honda  - abandoning a tie-up that would have created the world's third biggest automaker. Nissan shares fell 4% and Honda's rose 8%.</p><p class=\"\">Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday: </p><p class=\"\">* U.S. January private sector payrolls from ADP, Jan service sector surveys from ISM and S&amp;PGlobal, December international trade balance; Canada Dec international trade  </p><p class=\"\">* Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Fed Board Governor Michelle Bowma, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and Richmond Fed chief Thomas Barkin all speak; European Central Bank chief economist Philip Lane speaks in Washington</p><p class=\"\">* U.S. corporate earnings: Qualcomm, Boston Scientific, Walt Disney, Ford, News Corp, T Rowe Price, MetLife, Uber, Mckesson, Coognizant, Corpay, Allstate, Emereson

(OTCQB: DBLVF) (FSE: 1D4) (the \"Company\" or \"Doubleview\") is pleased to announce further drill hole results from the 2024 drill campaign at its 100% owned Polymetallic Hat Porphyry Project, located in northwestern British Columbia. Long copper-gold-silver-cobalt intercepts in Drill holes H075, H076 and H077 expand the mineralization and potentially will increase the Hat Project's resource in size and grade.</p><p class=\"\">2024 Exploration:</p><p class=\"\">The 2024 drilling program was designed to confirm the integrity of the resource estimate categories, particularly the indicated resource figures and potentially to allow elevating part or all to a measured resource.  Holes were directed to intersect shallow mineralization and to further explore high grade zones. Drilling has confirmed the continuity of mineralization indicating that the deposit exhibits greater consistency than typically expected of a porphyry-style deposit.</p><p class=\"\">Mr. Farshad Shirvani, president &amp; CEO of Doubleview, states: \"The 2024 drill campaign was successful in testing, confirming and improving our resource model. We are encouraged to see the occurrence of mineralization closer to the surface as well as strong mineralization drill holes which proves continuity and allows for more detailed structural interpretations. This will strongly reflect in the upcoming MRE.V 2.0 that will be part of Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) and add value to the Polymetallic Hat Deposit by increasing the metal content. We are continuously working on our exploration model as data becomes available to recognize details of the deposit and its critical and precious metals.\"</p><p class=\"\">The following section illustrates drill holes H075 to H077 intersecting the Hat polymetallic deposit along the strike of major high-grade mineralization.

One half is placed in a stout bag to form the assay sample that is forwarded securely to the independent analytical lab.  The remaining half core is stored on site where it is available for further examination and sampling. The assay cores are subject to a Chain of Custody routine as they are shipped from camp to a bonded carrier for delivery to the lab.</p><p class=\"\">Core samples are analysed at the North Vancouver facility of ALS Canada Ltd. using their PREP-31, PGM-ICP24, ME-MS61, and ME-ICP06 packages.  Each core sample is dried, then crushed to 70% passing a 2mm screen. All material is processed in an automatic Riffle splitter to yield a 250g homogenized, representative sample. This sub-sample is then pulverized to 85% passing a 75-micron screen. All samples are analyzed for Au, Pt, Pd by 50g fire-assay fusion/ICP-ES finish, using PGM-ICP24 package. A separate 0.25g pulp split is analyzed by Four Acid digestion/ICP-MS finish, reporting 48 elements. Over limit elements are analyzed by Ore Grade Four Acid digestion/ICP-ES finish using ME-OG62 assay package. All of Doubleview's core samples are analyzed or assayed at independent ISO 17025 and ISO 9001- certified laboratories.</p><p class=\"\">When initial assays are received and accepted by our staff, a certain fraction of the samples will be sent to a second ISO-certified lab for check assay and verification purposes.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">ING sticks to its call that  will start to lose support once it crosses 1.040, as the euro remains broadly unattractive from a macro fundamental perspective and United States President Donald Trump has indicated that the European Union should be next on the tariff list. </p><p class=\"\">A EUR:USD two-year swap rate gap at -185bps is a mirror of that — via the monetary policy channel — and a key disincentive to chase  much higher, wrote the bank in a note. </p><p class=\"\">Domestically, the eurozone calendar is relatively quiet for the remainder of the week, pointed out ING. Trade news will dominate , although the bank will be interested to hear whether the slightly hotter-than-expected inflation figures trigger some minor change in the narrative coming from European Central Bank officials. </p><p class=\"\">ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane speaks later Wednesday. </p><p class=\"\"> downside remains interesting, stated ING. Japanese nominal cash wages accelerated to 4.8% year over year in December, well above the 3.7% consensus. Real earnings were up 0.6% year over year. That reinforces ING's call for two rate hikes by the Bank of Japan this year and improves the outlook for the yen. </p><p class=\"\">Wenesday, Poland's central bank (NBP) is likely to leave rates unchanged again at 5.75% in line with expectations and market pricing. The decision itself should be a non-event. </p><p class=\"\">Investors may get some information from the statement, which last sent a hawkish signal in January. However, the main event will be Governor Adam Glapinski's press conference on Thursday, added ING. The statement and press conference in January were strongly hawkish. </p><p class=\"\">We can probably expect something similar on Wednesday and Thursday. However, it's hard to imagine at this point what more the governor might add to the hawkish message from January. ING believes the governor's hawkishness has run out and the market may see a more dovish NBP this week. </p><p class=\"\">Despite all this, foreign exchange is the main winner of the whole story, with  reaching its lowest levels in recent weeks since pre-COVID despite all the global volatility. In the bank's view, nothing will change on foreign exchange at the moment. </p><p class=\"\">Due to the collapse in EUR rates, the interest rate differential has widened again and justifies the current  lows in the 4.200-220 level in ING's view. Zloty rates are pricing in roughly 80bps of rate cuts for this year with the first move in July. The market is visibly focused on a peak in inflation and given the bank's current knowledge of the situation, pricing seems \"fair.\"</p></span></div>",

This ecosystem supports diverse content creation and monetization opportunities.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Advertising Products</strong>: Snap Inc. offers a range of advertising products, including AR Ads and Snap Ads, which leverage the platform's visual and interactive capabilities to engage users and provide value to advertisers.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Geographical Performance</strong>: The company reports user engagement and growth across different regions, with specific mention of North America, Europe, and the Rest of the World, highlighting varying growth rates and market characteristics.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">User Metrics</strong>: Daily Active Users (DAUs) increased by 9% year-over-year, reaching 453 million in Q4 2024, indicating strong user engagement and platform growth.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Future Outlook</strong>: Snap Inc. is focused on growing its community, diversifying revenue streams, and investing in the future of augmented reality. The company aims to navigate macroeconomic challenges by prioritizing investments and enhancing user engagement.</li></ul> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Strategic Initiatives</strong></p> <ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Strategic Reprioritization</strong>: The company has undertaken a strategic reprioritization to focus on three key areas: growing its community and deepening engagement, accelerating and diversifying revenue growth, and investing in augmented reality. This includes changes to the advertising platform to enhance delivery and measurement capabilities, despite facing challenges from macroeconomic factors and increased competition.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Capital Management</strong>: The company issued $750 million in convertible senior notes due in 2030, with net proceeds of $671.5 million. It also repurchased $859 million of convertible notes and authorized a $500 million stock repurchase program, although no shares were repurchased under this program in the fourth quarter of 2024.

This is compounded by competition for user attention and the need to penetrate older demographics or developing markets, which may be more difficult and costly.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Advertising Revenue</strong>: The company generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, which is subject to fluctuations based on advertisers' perceptions of the effectiveness of its platform. Changes in data privacy regulations, such as those implemented by Apple and potentially by Google, have already impacted the company's ability to target and measure advertisements effectively, leading to reduced demand and pricing for advertising products.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Operational Dependencies</strong>: Operationally, the company relies heavily on Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services for its computing needs. Any disruption or unfavorable changes in terms by these providers could seriously harm operations. The company also faces risks related to intellectual property protection, as it relies on various legal protections that may not be enforceable in all jurisdictions.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Governance Risks</strong>: The co-founders' control over voting stock presents governance risks, as they can influence major decisions, potentially against the interests of other shareholders. Macroeconomic uncertainties, including inflation, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical conflicts, could adversely impact advertising revenue and operational stability.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Cybersecurity Risks</strong>: The company is also exposed to cybersecurity risks, as it collects and processes sensitive information. Any breach or failure to protect this data could damage its reputation and lead to legal and regulatory consequences.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Management's Discussion and Analysis</strong>: Management acknowledges the challenges posed by declining user growth and increased competition. The company is focusing on product innovation and diversification of revenue streams, such as subscription models, to mitigate these risks. However, the success of these initiatives is uncertain, and the company may face increased costs and regulatory scrutiny.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Market Risks</strong>: The company is exposed to market risks, including fluctuations in advertising demand and pricing, which are influenced by broader economic conditions and changes in data privacy regulations. The reliance on third-party cloud services also presents operational risks that could impact financial performance if service disruptions occur.</li></ul><p class=\"\">SEC Filing: <a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1564408/000156440825000019/snap-20241231.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Snap Inc [ SNAP ] - 10-K - Feb. 04, 2025</a></p></span></div>",
