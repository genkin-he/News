This press release and supporting schedules include the non-GAAP measures adjusted EBITDA; consolidated debt to last twelve months adjusted EBITDA, which we refer to as our leverage ratio; distributable cash flow (DCF); adjusted free cash flow (Adjusted FCF); and Adjusted FCF after distributions.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA is a financial performance measure used by management, industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies to assess the financial performance and operating results of our ongoing business operations. Additionally, we believe adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors for trending, analyzing and benchmarking our operating results from period to period as compared to other companies that may have different financing and capital structures. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for: (i) provision for income taxes; (ii) net interest and other financial costs; (iii) depreciation and amortization; (iv) income/(loss) from equity method investments; (v) distributions and adjustments related to equity method investments; (vi) impairment expense; (vii) noncontrolling interests; and (viii) other adjustments, as applicable.</p><p class=\"\">DCF is a financial performance and liquidity measure used by management and by the board of directors of our general partner as a key component in the determination of cash distributions paid to unitholders. We believe DCF is an important financial measure for unitholders as an indicator of cash return on investment and to evaluate whether the partnership is generating sufficient cash flow to support quarterly distributions. In addition, DCF is commonly used by the investment community because the market value of publicly traded partnerships is based, in part, on DCF and cash distributions paid to unitholders. We define DCF as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for: (i) deferred revenue impacts; (ii) sales-type lease payments, net of income; (iii) adjusted net interest and other financial costs; (iv) net maintenance capital expenditures; (v) equity method investment capital expenditures paid out; and (vi) other adjustments as deemed necessary.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted FCF and Adjusted FCF after distributions are financial liquidity measures used by management in the allocation of capital and to assess financial performance. We believe that unitholders may use this metric to analyze our ability to manage leverage and return capital. We define Adjusted FCF as net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for: (i) net cash used in investing activities; (ii) cash contributions from MPC; and (iii) cash distributions to noncontrolling interests. We define Adjusted FCF after distributions as Adjusted FCF less base distributions to common and preferred unitholders. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, DCF, Adjusted FCF and Adjusted FCF after distributions provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations.</p><p class=\"\">Leverage ratio is a liquidity measure used by management, industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies to analyze our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures.</p><p class=\"\">The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and DCF are net income and net cash provided by operating activities while the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted FCF and Adjusted FCF after distributions is net cash provided by operating activities. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives to GAAP net income or net cash provided by operating activities as they have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.</p><p class=\"\">For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, DCF, Adjusted FCF, Adjusted FCF after distributions and our leverage ratio to their most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the tables below.</p><p class=\"\">Forward-Looking Statements</p><p class=\"\">This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding MPLX LP (MPLX).

(NYSE: LODE) today announced that its subsidiary, Comstock Fuels Corporation (“Comstock Fuels”), was approved by the Oklahoma State Treasurer’s Office to issue up to $152 million in qualified private activity bonds.</p><p class=\"\">This allocation of up to $152 million in Qualified Private Activity Bonds that can be issued by Comstock Fuels represents a major achievement in Comstock Fuels’ plans for financing and building its first 400,000 barrel per year commercial demonstration facility in a soon-to-be-selected site in Oklahoma.</p><p class=\"\">This overall approval by the Oklahoma State Treasurer’s Office comes under the Oklahoma Private Activity Bond Allocation Act and would consist of allocations from the Oklahoma Economic Development Pool, the Oklahoma Exempt Facilities Pool, and the Oklahoma Carryforward Pool. The Oklahoma Development Finance Authority (“ODFA”) sponsored this bond allocation to support the State’s essential infrastructure projects with Comstock’s first Oklahoma commercial biorefining facility.</p><p class=\"\">“This allocation is a foundational component of our overall capital and financing plans for Comstock Fuels, including funding each of our planned Bioleum™ Refineries in the U.S. with dedicated project financing,” said Chad Michael Black, Director of Business Development at Comstock Fuels. “Oklahoma has taken a leadership role in accelerating advanced domestic energy solutions and the support from the State Treasurer’s Office and the ODFA underscores our strong alignment with Oklahoma for developing, deploying and operating diverse, scalable and essential energy infrastructure for our communities.”</p><p class=\"\">“We are rapidly achieving the critical prerequisites for securing the project financing needed to build our first commercial demonstration facility, with over $150 million of that objective supported by Oklahoma’s tax-efficient, municipal revenue bond allocation, $3 million in direct Oklahoma-based grants, and a growing group of strategic investors,” stated Corrado De Gasperis, Executive Chairman of Comstock and Comstock Fuels. “We’re also close to selecting an investment banking partner to facilitate the bond placement and underwriting. We’re thrilled to receive such strong support from Oklahoma as we integrate feedstock, site infrastructure, and offtake into a whole new standard for domestic energy production.”</p><p class=\"\">Private activity bonds under the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) are described generally as any bond: (1) of which more than 10% of the proceeds is to be used in a trade or business of any person or persons other than a governmental unit or which is to be directly or indirectly repaid, or secured by revenues from a private trade or business; and (2) in which an amount exceeding the lesser of 5% or $5 million of the proceeds is to be used for loans to any person or persons other than a governmental unit.</p><p class=\"\">The Federal Tax Reform Act of 1986 established limits on the volume of private activity bonds that may be issued in a state during any calendar year. To ensure compliance with federal law, the Oklahoma legislature passed the Oklahoma Private Activity Bond Allocation Act.</p><p class=\"\">Most private activity bonds must be sold on a taxable basis. However, the Code grants exceptions when certain bonds can be sold on a tax-exempt basis (“Qualified Private Activity Bonds”). Such bonds, with certain exceptions, are subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. The Code also imposes a limitation on the amount of Qualified Private Activity Bonds which may be issued by a state in any calendar year.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Comstock Fuels Corporation </strong></p><p class=\"\">Comstock Fuels Corporation (“Comstock Fuels”) delivers advanced lignocellulosic biomass refining solutions that set industry benchmarks for production of cellulosic ethanol, gasoline, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”), and other renewable Bioleum™ fuels, with extremely low carbon intensity scores of 15 and market-leading yields of up to 140 gallons per dry metric ton of feedstock (on a gasoline gallon equivalent basis, or “GGE”), depending on feedstock, site conditions, and other process parameters. Comstock Fuels additionally holds the exclusive rights to intellectual properties developed by Hexas Biomass Inc. (“Hexas”) for production of purpose grown energy crops in liquid fuels applications with proven yields exceeding 25 to 30 dry metric tons per acre per year. The combination of Comstock Fuels’ high yield Bioleum refining platform and Hexas’ high yield energy crops allows for the production of enough feedstock to produce upwards of 100 barrels of fuel per acre per year, effectively transforming marginal agricultural lands with regenerative practices into perpetual “drop-in sedimentary oilfields” with the potential to dramatically boost regional energy security and rural economies.</p><p class=\"\">Comstock Fuels plans to contribute to domestic energy dominance by directly building, owning, and operating a network of Bioleum Refineries in the U.S. to produce about 200 million barrels of renewable fuel per year by 2035, starting with its planned first 400,000 barrel per year commercial demonstration facility in Oklahoma. Comstock Fuels also licenses its advanced feedstock and refining solutions to third parties for additional production in the U.S. and global markets, including several recently announced and other pending projects.

As intended, Agriculture dealer inventory went down in Q4 by over $700 million due to focused retail sales support and 34% fewer production hours. Our proactive and ongoing efforts to align our business structure with the current industry environment have allowed us to deliver our products with reasonable margin erosion. The challenging market conditions will continue at least through the first half of 2025, and we will keep production levels fairly low by design to drive channel inventory down further.

CNH's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful and relevant information regarding its operating results and enhance the readers' ability to assess CNH's financial performance and financial position. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to identify operational trends, as well as make decisions regarding future spending, resource allocations and other operational decisions as they provide additional transparency with respect to our core operations. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning under U.S. GAAP and are unlikely to be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not intended to be substitutes for measures of financial performance and financial position as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.</p><p class=\"\">CNH's non-GAAP financial measures are defined as follows:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBIT of Industrial Activities under U.S. GAAP is defined as net   income (loss) before the following items: Income taxes, Financial   Services' results, Industrial Activities' interest expenses, net, foreign   exchange gains/losses, finance and non-service component of pension and   other post-employment benefit costs, restructuring expenses, and certain   non-recurring items. In particular, non-recurring items are specifically   disclosed items that management considers rare or discrete events that   are infrequent in nature and not reflective of on-going operational   activities.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBIT Margin of Industrial Activities: is computed by dividing   Adjusted EBIT of Industrial Activities by Net Sales of Industrial   Activities.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted Net Income (Loss): is defined as net income (loss), less   restructuring charges and non-recurring items, after tax.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted Diluted EPS: is computed by dividing Adjusted Net Income (loss)   attributable to CNH Industrial N.V. by a weighted-average number of   common shares outstanding during the period that takes into consideration   potential common shares outstanding deriving from the CNH share-based   payment awards, when inclusion is not anti-dilutive. When we provide   guidance for adjusted diluted EPS, we do not provide guidance on an   earnings per share basis because the GAAP measure will include   potentially significant items that have not yet occurred and are   difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted Income Tax (Expense) Benefit: is defined as income taxes less   the tax effect of restructuring expenses and non-recurring items, and   non-recurring tax charges or benefits.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Adjusted ETR): is computed by dividing a)   adjusted income taxes by b) income (loss) before income taxes and equity   in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates, less   restructuring expenses and non-recurring items.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Net Cash (Debt) and Net Cash (Debt) of Industrial Activities: Net Cash   (Debt) is defined as total debt less intersegment notes receivable, cash   and cash equivalents, restricted cash, other current financial assets   (primarily current securities, short-term deposits and investments   towards high-credit rating counterparties) and derivative hedging debt.   CNH provides the reconciliation of Net Cash (Debt) to Total (Debt), which   is the most directly comparable measure included in the consolidated   balance sheets. Due to different sources of cash flows used for the   repayment of the debt between Industrial Activities and Financial   Services (by cash from operations for Industrial Activities and by   collection of financing receivables for Financial Services), management   separately evaluates the cash flow performance of Industrial Activities   using Net Cash (Debt) of Industrial Activities.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Free Cash Flow of Industrial Activities (or Industrial Free Cash Flow):   refers to Industrial Activities only, and is computed as consolidated   cash flow from operating activities less: cash flow from operating   activities of Financial Services; investments of Industrial Activities in   assets sold under operating leases, property, plant and equipment and   intangible assets; change in derivatives hedging debt of Industrial   Activities; as well as other changes and intersegment eliminations.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Change excl. FX or Constant Currency: CNH discusses the fluctuations in   revenues on a constant currency basis by applying the prior year average   exchange rates to current year's revenues expressed in local currency in   order to eliminate the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. </li></ul><p class=\"\">The tables attached to this press release provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.</p><p class=\"\">Forward-looking Statements</p><p class=\"\">All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this press release including competitive strengths; business strategy; future financial position or operating results; budgets; projections with respect to revenue, income, earnings (or loss) per share, capital expenditures, dividends, liquidity, capital structure or other financial items; costs; and plans and objectives of management regarding operations and products, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements also include statements regarding the future performance of CNH and its subsidiaries on a standalone basis. These statements may include terminology such as \"may\", \"will\", \"expect\", \"could\", \"should\", \"intend\", \"estimate\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"outlook\", \"continue\", \"remain\", \"on track\", \"design\", \"target\", \"objective\", \"goal\", \"forecast\", \"projection\", \"prospects\", \"plan\", or similar terminology. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Rather, they are based on current views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside our control and are difficult to predict. If any of these risks and uncertainties materialize (or they occur with a degree of severity that the Company is unable to predict) or other assumptions underlying any of the forward-looking statements prove to be incorrect, including any assumptions regarding strategic plans, the actual results or developments may differ materially from any future results or developments expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.</p><p class=\"\">Factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others: economic conditions in each of our markets, including the significant uncertainty caused by geopolitical events; production and supply chain disruptions, including industry capacity constraints, material availability, and global logistics delays and constraints; the many interrelated factors that affect consumer confidence and worldwide demand for capital goods and capital goods-related products, changes in government policies regarding banking, monetary and fiscal policy; legislation, particularly pertaining to capital goods-related issues such as agriculture, the environment, debt relief and subsidy program policies, commerce and infrastructure development; government policies on international trade and investment, including sanctions and actions after recent U.S. elections in respect to global trade, tariffs, trade agreements, and the uncertainty of our ability to sell products internationally based on these actions and policies; actions of competitors in the various industries in which we compete; development and use of new technologies and technological difficulties; the interpretation of, or adoption of new, compliance requirements with respect to engine emissions, safety or other aspects of our products; labor relations; interest rates and currency exchange rates; inflation and deflation; energy prices; prices for agricultural commodities and material price increases; housing starts and other construction activity; our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt; price pressure on new and used equipment; the resolution of pending litigation and investigations on a wide range of topics, including dealer and supplier litigation, intellectual property rights disputes, product warranty and defective product claims, and emissions and/or fuel economy regulatory and contractual issues; security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, technology failures, and other disruptions to the information technology infrastructure of CNH and its suppliers and dealers; security breaches with respect to our products; our pension plans and other post-employment obligations; political and civil unrest; volatility and deterioration of capital and financial markets, including pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), terrorist attacks in Europe and elsewhere; the remediation of a material weakness; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from our business initiatives as part of our strategic plan, including targeted restructuring actions to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operations; our failure to realize, or a delay in realizing, all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances or divestitures and other similar risks and uncertainties, and our success in managing the risks involved in the foregoing.</p><p class=\"\">Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions relating to the factors described in this press release, which are sometimes based upon estimates and data received from third parties. Such estimates and data are often revised. Actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside CNH's control.

condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had revised prior periods' results to reflect an immaterial correction for the accounting treatment related to highly inflationary accounting for our unconsolidated affiliate in Türkiye. CNH owns 37.5% of TürkTraktör ve Ziraat Makineleri A.S. (TTRAK.IS) and accounts for its ownership stake under the equity method. The functional currency of Türkiye-based TürkTraktör is the Turkish lira, and the Türkiye economy was deemed highly inflationary in 2022. CNH determined that its translation criteria from Turkish lira into CNH's functional currency of U.S. dollars resulted in an overstatement of CNH's Equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates by $96 million in 2023 and by $67 million in the first half of 2024. Impacts in 2022 were included in the 2023 amount. We have revised our GAAP and Non-GAAP results for all prior periods presented herein.</p><p class=\"\">The prior period impacts to the Company's consolidated statements of operations and the related

The Facilities business   would have experienced growth in the quarter without these account   exits.   Foodservice revenue and Foodservice Organic revenue both   increased 5% compared to the prior year period.     </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">FSS International revenue growth was broad-based across all geographic   regions, largely from ongoing base business growth and net new business   performance--with the U.K., Canada, Chile, and Ireland driving the   increase.

Aramark reported stronger cash flow compared to the prior year period with Net Cash used in operating activities improving approximately $70 million and Free Cash Flow improving approximately $63 million. This performance was led by higher net income and favorable working capital.</p><p class=\"\">At quarter-end, the Company had over $1.7 billion in cash availability.</p><p class=\"\">Aramark commenced repurchasing shares toward the end of the first quarter as part of its $500 million share repurchase program announced in November 2024.

The Company's new business pipeline across the organization remains significant, including in first-time outsourcing. Aramark is confident in its ability to achieve Net New of 4% to 5% of prior year revenue--with retention levels above 95%--in fiscal 2025 and beyond. As a result of the favorable trends in the business, the Company reaffirms its performance expectations for fiscal 2025.</p><p class=\"\">In December 2024, Aramark completed the acquisition of the European-based GPO, Quantum Cost Consultancy Group, further strengthening the Company's position as a leading global professional procurement and supply chain services provider. Quantum has managed spend of $500 million with operations in countries such as Spain, Portugal, Germany, and the Netherlands, serving hotels, restaurants, gaming destinations, and senior and youth residencies.

We believe these financial measures are useful to investors because they enable better comparisons of our historical results and allow our investors to evaluate our performance based on the same metrics that we use to evaluate our performance and trends in our results. These financial metrics are not measurements of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Our presentation of these metrics has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. You should not consider these measures as alternatives to revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share or net cash (used in) provided by operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Revenue (Organic), Foodservice Adjusted Revenue (Organic), Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, Covenant Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow as presented by us may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies because not all companies use identical calculations.</p><p class=\"\">Explanatory Notes to the Non-GAAP Schedules</p><p class=\"\">Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets - adjustments to eliminate amortization expense recognized on acquisition-related intangible assets.</p><p class=\"\">Severance and Other Charges - adjustments to eliminate severance expenses in the applicable period ($6.2 million for the first quarter of 2024).</p><p class=\"\">Spin-off Related Charges - adjustments to eliminate charges related to the Company's prior year spin-off of the Uniform segment, including accounting and legal related expenses, third party advisory costs and other costs.
