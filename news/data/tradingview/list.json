We are focused on reshaping the way travelers search for and compare different types of accommodations, such as hotels, vacation rentals and apartments, while enabling our advertisers to grow their businesses by providing them with access to a broad audience of travelers via our websites and apps. Our platform allows travelers to make informed decisions by personalizing their search for accommodations and providing them with access to a deep supply of relevant information and prices. As of December 31, 2024, we offered access to more than 5.0 million hotels and other types of accommodation in over 190 countries, including over 3.8 million units of alternative accommodation, such as vacation rentals and apartments. Our search platform forms the core of our user experience and can be accessed globally via 53 localized websites and apps available in 31 languages.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Discussion of Results</strong></p><p class=\"\">The discussion of results should be considered together with our unaudited financial information included with this review and the periodic reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Certain information and disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) have been omitted from this review. The unaudited information included with this review is derived from our preliminary internal financial reports and is subject to revision based on the completion of our year-end processes necessary to finalize our audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Recent Trends</strong></p><p class=\"\">Total revenues grew by 3% to €94.8 million in the fourth quarter, compared to the same prior year period, primarily driven by the 5% growth in Referral Revenue. We believe the return to year-over-year growth represents a turning point in our strategic multi-year efforts to rejuvenate the brand and achieve our goal of double-digit revenue growth in the medium-term as previously announced. Our strategic focus on rebuilding the brand has been critical to achieving these results. Net income and Adjusted EBITDA grew by 104% to €5.1 million, and by 52% to €11.1 million, respectively, compared to the same prior year period, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter.</p><p class=\"\">Investments in our branded channel traffic2 across all three reporting segments have fueled the growth during the quarter. These investments assisted us in reaching a larger audience, resulting in a strengthened branded baseline that we believe will have a long-term positive impact. In late December 2024, we launched our new global marketing campaigns featuring our Brand Ambassador, Jürgen Klopp. These campaigns have resonated well with audiences in key launch markets, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, which we believe has benefited our brand during the fourth quarter of 2024 and will continue into 2025.</p><p class=\"\">Referral Revenue grew year-over-year in our Americas and Rest of World segments. In Americas, we observed healthy levels of growth in monetization as compared to the third quarter of 2024 and the fourth quarter of the prior year. In Rest of World, higher branded channel traffic volumes and better booking conversion more than offset the slightly softer monetization for the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year (though monetization in Rest of World showed positive improvements over the course of the fourth quarter). We observed softer monetization in Developed Europe as compared to the same prior year quarter. Referral Revenue in Developed Europe declined 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, continuing the trend of sequential improvement seen throughout the second half of the year, driven by increased branded channel traffic in response to our brand marketing investments.</p><p class=\"\">In conjunction with our revenue growth, operating expenses of €87.0 million remained relatively stable compared to €87.3 million in the same prior year quarter. Operating expenses excluding Advertising Spend of €57.4 million (2023: €57.2 million), decreased by 2% compared to the same prior year period, demonstrating the successful execution of our strategic objective to deliver revenue growth while exercising operational discipline.</p><p class=\"\">_____________________</p><p class=\"\">2 Branded channel traffic refers to traffic to our platform through: one of our localized platform websites, one of our downloadable mobile applications, branded search engine optimization marketing channels (or \"branded free traffic\") for keyword searches that are inclusive of the trivago brand name, and/or paid keyword searches that include the trivago brand name, such as \"trivago\" or \"trivago hotel\".</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Outlook</strong></p><p class=\"\">During the first weeks of 2025, we have observed strong double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in all three reporting segments. We are encouraged by the strong start to the new year, which has exceeded our expectations. We believe the performance marketing channel3 headwinds observed in prior quarters have largely subsided over the course of 2024 and anticipate this will reduce volatility in our upcoming earnings.</p><p class=\"\">Our total Advertising Spend remains at a fraction of historical levels, which we believe highlights the significant upside potential that remains of further increasing our global marketing efforts. We plan to continue pursuing our strategy of prioritizing investing in our brand over short-term profit maximization and to take an opportunity-driven approach to investing, focusing on investments that we believe will deliver long-term benefits. We expect to continue re-investing our profits into our marketing strategy, including further increasing our Advertising Spend in the upcoming year to maintain the positive momentum we have seen so far. We believe trivago is well-positioned, well-capitalized, and ready to sustain its growth trajectory. As a result, for the full year 2025, we expect total revenues to grow by at least high single-digit percentage levels compared to the same period in 2024, and to achieve at least breakeven Adjusted EBITDA levels for the full year-ending 2025.</p><p class=\"\">Revenue, Advertising Spend, and Return of Advertising Spend</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Referral Revenue &amp; Other Revenue</strong></p><p class=\"\">We match our users’ searches with large numbers of hotel and other accommodation offers through our auction platform, which we call our marketplace. With our marketplace, we provide advertisers a competitive forum to access user traffic by facilitating a vast quantity of auctions on any particular day. Advertisers submit hotel room and other accommodation rates and participate in our marketplace primarily by making bids for each user click on an advertised rate for a hotel or other accommodation on a cost-per-click, or CPC, basis. We also offer the option for our advertisers to participate in our marketplace on a cost-per-acquisition, or CPA, basis.</p><p class=\"\">We earn substantially all of our revenue when users of our websites and apps click on hotel and accommodation offers or advertisements in our search results and are referred to one of our advertisers, or when a user makes a booking on the advertiser's website ultimately from a referral from our platform. We call this our Referral Revenue.</p><p class=\"\">_____________________</p><p class=\"\">3 Performance marketing channel traffic refers to traffic to our platform that is acquired for our website by purchasing certain keywords (excluding keyword combinations inclusive of the trivago brand name) from general search engines (referred to as “search engine marketing”), such as Google or Yahoo!, and through advertisements on other online marketing channels such as advertising networks, social media sites, and affiliate websites.</p><p class=\"\">Management has identified three reportable segments: Americas, Developed Europe and Rest of World (RoW). Our Americas segment is comprised of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, the United States and Uruguay. Our Developed Europe segment is comprised of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Our RoW segment is comprised of all other countries. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the most significant countries by revenue in that segment were Japan, Australia, Turkey, New Zealand, and India. We have also determined that our equity method investment in Holisto Limited has met the criteria for an operating segment, however, it does not meet the quantitative thresholds of a separate reportable segment.</p><p class=\"\">We also earn revenue by offering our advertisers business-to-business (B2B) solutions such as data product offerings and subscription fees earned from advertisers for the trivago Business Studio subscriptions. These revenue streams do not represent a significant portion of our total revenue.</p><p class=\"\">Referral Revenue by Segment &amp; Other Revenue (€ millions)</p><div class=\"tableWrapper-pIO_GYwT\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td>     </td><td colspan=\"7\">   Three months ended December 31,   </td><td colspan=\"7\">   Twelve months ended December 31,   </td></tr><tr><td>     </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2024  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2023  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  Δ €  </td><td>  Δ %  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2024  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2023  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  Δ €  </td><td>  Δ % Y/Y  </td></tr><tr><td>  Americas  </td><td>  €  </td><td>  36.0  </td><td>  €  </td><td>  33.3  </td><td>  €  </td><td>  2.7  </td><td>  8%  </td><td>  €  </td><td>  173.6  </td><td>  €  </td><td>  176.4  </td><td>  €  </td><td>  (2.8)  </td><td>  (2)%  </td></tr><tr><td>  Developed Europe  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  37.0  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  37.6  </td><td>     </td><td>  (0.6)  </td><td>  (2)%  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  192.1  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  215.7  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (23.6)  </td><td>  (11)%  </td></tr><tr><td>  Rest of World  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  20.5  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  17.9  </td><td>     </td><td>  2.6  </td><td>  15%  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  90.5  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  84.7  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  5.8  </td><td>  7%  </td></tr><tr><td>  Total Referral Revenue  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  93.5  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  88.8  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  4.7  </td><td>  5%  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  456.2  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  476.8  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  (20.6)  </td><td>  (4)%  </td></tr><tr><td>  Other revenue  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  1.3  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2.9  </td><td>     </td><td>  (1.6)  </td><td>  (55)%  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  4.7  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  8.2  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (3.5)  </td><td>  (43)%  </td></tr><tr><td>  Total revenue  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  94.8  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  91.7  </td><td>  €  </td><td>  3.1  </td><td>  3%  </td><td>  €  </td><td>  460.8  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  485.0  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  (24.2)  </td><td>  (5)%  </td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"\"><em>Note:</em> <em>Some</em> <em>figures</em> <em>may</em> <em>not</em> <em>add</em> <em>up</em> <em>due</em> <em>to</em><em> rounding.</em></p><p class=\"\">Total revenue increased by €3.1 million during the three months ended December 31, 2024, and decreased by €24.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023.

This was partly offset by lower performance marketing channel traffic volumes from increased competition and softer bidding dynamics observed on our platform. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, the overall decline of €24.2 million was the result of lower performance marketing channel traffic volumes from increased competition and softer bidding dynamics on our platform, which outweighed the revenue growth from branded channel traffic in response to our increased brand marketing investments and improved booking conversion.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><em>Americas</em></strong></p><p class=\"\">Referral Revenue increased by €2.7 million and decreased by €2.8 million during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, the growth in branded channel traffic revenue was more than offset by the decline in performance marketing channel traffic volumes, resulting in an overall decline.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><em>Developed Europe</em></strong></p><p class=\"\">Referral Revenue decreased by €0.6 million and €23.6 million during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decreases were primarily driven by lower performance marketing channel traffic volumes and softer bidding dynamics on our platform. Despite the overall decreases, we observed higher revenues generated from branded channel traffic sources, reaching double-digit growth in both the third and fourth quarters of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, as a result of increased brand investments.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><em>Rest of World</em></strong></p><p class=\"\">Referral Revenue increased by €2.6 million and €5.8 million during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases were primarily driven by higher branded channel traffic volumes resulting from our increased brand marketing investments and better booking conversion. These were partly offset primarily by slightly softer bidding dynamics. While revenues generated from performance marketing channels were still lower during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, we saw a year-over- year increase in the third and fourth quarters of 2024, particularly driven by traffic derived from sources other than Google.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><em>Other Revenue</em></strong></p><p class=\"\">Other revenue decreased by €1.6 million and €3.5 million during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease during the three months was driven by lower depositary fee reimbursements and the discontinuation of other B2B revenue sources in the middle of 2024. The decrease for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 was further driven by the progressive reduction of white label revenues as we discontinued the product over the course of 2023.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Advertiser Concentration</strong></p><p class=\"\">We generate the majority of our Referral Revenue from online travel agencies, or OTAs.

The impairment was driven by the decline in revenue observed in 2024 compared to the prior year primarily resulting from the headwinds in our performance marketing channels that have delayed our previously expected growth and continued uncertainty in respect of the overall economic environment.

The impairments were driven by adjustments made to our profitability outlook arising from the announced strategy shift to long-term growth, share price decline during the third quarter of 2023, uncertainty in our operating environment, and the continued uncertainty in respect of the overall economic environment.</p><p class=\"\">Income Taxes, Net Loss and Adjusted EBITDA(1) (€ millions)</p><div class=\"tableWrapper-pIO_GYwT\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td> </td><td colspan=\"6\">Three months ended December 31,</td><td> </td><td> </td><td colspan=\"6\">Twelve months ended December 31,</td></tr><tr><td>     </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2024   </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2023  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  Δ €  </td><td>     </td><td colspan=\"3\">  2024  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2023  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  Δ €  </td></tr><tr><td>  Operating income/(loss)  </td><td>€ </td><td>7.8</td><td>  €  </td><td>          4.4  </td><td>  €  </td><td>          3.4  </td><td>     </td><td colspan=\"2\">  €  </td><td>   (32.2)  </td><td>  €  </td><td>  (156.6)  </td><td>  €  </td><td>   124.4  </td></tr><tr><td>  Other income/(expense)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"4\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td></tr><tr><td>  Interest expense  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (0.0)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (0.0)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  0.0  </td><td colspan=\"4\">  (0.0)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (0.0)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  0.0  </td></tr><tr><td>  Interest income  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  0.8  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  1.1  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (0.3)  </td><td colspan=\"4\">  3.6  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  5.2  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (1.6)  </td></tr><tr><td>  Other, net  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (0.0)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (0.1)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  0.1  </td><td colspan=\"4\">  0.4  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (0.5)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  0.9  </td></tr><tr><td>  Total other income, net  </td><td>  €  </td><td>          0.8  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">          0.9  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">     (0.1)  </td><td>     </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"2\">          3.9  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">          4.7  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">     (0.8)  </td></tr><tr><td>     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"4\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td></tr><tr><td>  Income/(loss) before income taxes  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  8.7  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  5.4  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  3.3  </td><td colspan=\"4\">  (28.2)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (151.9)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  123.7  </td></tr><tr><td>  Expense/(benefit) for income taxes  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2.8  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2.8  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  0.0  </td><td colspan=\"4\">  (6.3)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  12.4  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (18.7)  </td></tr><tr><td>  Income/(loss) before equity method investments  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">          5.8  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">          2.5  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">          3.3  </td><td>     </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"2\">   (22.0)  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  (164.3)  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">   142.3  </td></tr><tr><td>  Loss from equity method investments  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (0.8)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (0.0)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (0.7)  </td><td colspan=\"4\">  (1.7)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (0.2)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (1.5)  </td></tr><tr><td>  Net income/(loss)  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">          5.1  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">          2.5  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">          2.6  </td><td>     </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"2\">   (23.7)  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  (164.5)  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">   140.8  </td></tr><tr><td>     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"4\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td></tr><tr><td>  Adjusted EBITDA(1)  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">   11.1  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">          7.3  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">          3.8  </td><td>     </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"2\">   10.2  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">   54.1  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">   (43.9)  </td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"\"><em>Note: Some figures may not add up due to rounding.</em></p><p class=\"\">_____________________(1) “Adjusted EBITDA” is a non-GAAP measure.

The total weighted-average tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2024 was 31.2%, which primarily reflects the German statutory tax rate of approximately 31.2%. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2024 was 32.9%, compared to 52.5% in the same period in 2023. The change in effective tax rate between the two periods primarily reflects the difference in deferred tax adjustments related to temporary items.</p><p class=\"\">Income tax benefit was €6.3 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, compared to income tax expense of €12.4 million during the same period in 2023. The effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 was 22.1%, compared to (8.2)% in the same period in 2023. The change in effective tax rate between the two periods primarily reflects the non-tax-deductible goodwill impairment recognized in the prior year, the lower amount of trademark impairment recognized in the prior year, and the difference in pre-tax profit and loss positions between the periods.</p><p class=\"\">The difference between the weighted average tax rate and the effective tax rate for both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024 primarily relates to the non-tax-deductible share-based compensation expense in both periods.</p><p class=\"\">The uncertain tax position for unrecognized tax benefits relating to the deductibility of expenses was €8.7 million as of December 31, 2024. This liability is presented within accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024, compared to the presentation in other long-term liabilities as of December 31, 2023.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Net Income/Loss and Adjusted EBITDA</strong></p><p class=\"\">Net income was €5.1 million during the three months ended December 31, 2024, and net loss was €23.7 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. The twelve months ended included an impairment charge of €30.0 million to our indefinite-lived intangible assets. Adjusted EBITDA was €11.1 million and €10.2 million, during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by favorable return on our brand advertising investments particularly during the second half of the year.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Balance Sheet and Cash Flows</strong></p><p class=\"\">Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were €134.1 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to €102.2 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase of €31.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, was mainly driven by €20.3 million cash provided by operating activities and €12.2 million cash provided by investing activities, partly offset by cash used in financing activities of €0.8 million.</p><p class=\"\">Cash provided by operating activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, was primarily driven by the net loss adjusted by non-cash items of €10.3 million and the overall positive change in operating assets and liabilities of €9.9 million. Non-cash items reconciled from net loss include impairment losses of €30.1 million, share-based compensation of €8.5 million, and depreciation of €3.7 million, which includes the reduction from the tax credits recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024, partly offset by a reduction of deferred income taxes of €9.8 million.</p><p class=\"\">The positive change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in accounts payable of €6.9 million, mostly due to the timing of vendor payments as compared to the same prior year period, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of €5.6 million, primarily due to the end of our long-term sponsorship agreement in June 2024 that was included in prepaid advertising, and a decrease in tax receivables of €5.4 million, excluding the €1.4 million tax credits recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024 related to previously capitalized development costs. These positive changes were partly offset by an increase in accounts receivable of €4.3 million due to higher revenues in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, and a decrease in income tax payables of €0.5 million.</p><p class=\"\">Cash provided by investing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, was primarily driven by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of €25.2 million. This was partly offset by the €10.2 million equity investment in Holisto Limited in the third quarter of 2024 and cash outflows of €2.8 million related to capital expenditures, including internal-use software and website development. The €1.0 million non-cash receipt of tax credits presented on the statement of cash flows relates to the total tax credits recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024 (see \"Technology and Content\" for more details). The net €0.4 million credit recorded in property and equipment on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet consists of an initial €1.0 million non-cash credit, net of €0.6 million of accumulated depreciation related to depreciation expense already recognized in prior periods.</p><p class=\"\">Cash used in financing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, was primarily driven by the payments totaling €0.7 million related to withholding taxes on net share settlements of equity awards.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">trivago N.V.

A “non-GAAP financial measure” refers to a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP in such company’s financial statements. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate our operating performance, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions on capital allocation. We also believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating performance and consolidated results of operations in the same manner as our management, and the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure in comparing financial results between periods as these costs may vary independent of core business performance.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, including net income/loss. Some of these limitations are:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect expenses, such as restructuring and other related reorganization costs;</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Although depreciation, amortization and impairments are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated, amortized or impaired may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; and</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.</li></ul><p class=\"\">We periodically provide an Adjusted EBITDA outlook. We are, however, unable to provide a reconciliation of our Adjusted EBITDA outlook to net income/(loss), the comparable GAAP measure, because certain items that are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA cannot be reasonably or reliably predicted or are not in our control, including, in particular, the timing or magnitude of share-based compensation, interest, taxes, impairments, restructuring related costs and/or significant legal settlements and court-ordered penalties without unreasonable efforts, and these items could significantly impact, either individually or in the aggregate, net

The Norwegian energy major's capital allocation plans assume a slowdown in organic offshore wind plans and a slowdown in onshore renewables, they say. Some of its low carbon solutions projects also appear to be slowing, they say. The results look like a slight beat to consensus at the net income level, but guidance for a $5 billion buyback in 2025 is slightly below the $6 billion expected. Total shareholder distributions of $9 billion marks a step down versus 2024 levels of $14.6 billion. \"We think there were some lofty expectations into the event around potential distributions.\" Shares trade 3.2% lower at 268.85 Norwegian kroner.
