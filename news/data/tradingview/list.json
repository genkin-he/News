Operating income increased 5% to a record $469.0 million and operating margins were 26.6% in the quarter, up 90 basis points from the prior year. Operating cash flow in the quarter was a record $550.0 million, free cash flow was a record $498.3 million, and free cash flow to net income conversion was 129%.</p><p class=\"\">On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter earnings per diluted share were a record $1.67. Adjusted earnings in the quarter were a record $1.87 per diluted share, up 11% from the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted earnings adds back non-cash, after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of $0.20 per diluted share.</p><p class=\"\">\"AMETEK delivered strong results in the fourth quarter, with outstanding operating performance driving robust core margin expansion, record earnings and strong cash flow growth,\" stated David A. Zapico, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"Our operational flexibility and disciplined execution allowed us to successfully navigate a continued uncertain macro-economic environment and position AMETEK for continued long-term success.\"</p><p class=\"\">For the full year, AMETEK's sales were $6.94 billion, an increase of 5% over 2023. On a GAAP basis, full year 2024 operating income was $1.78 billion, or 25.6% of sales, and earnings were $5.93 per diluted share. Full year operating cash flow was $1,829 million, up 5%, versus 2023.</p><p class=\"\">Full year adjusted operating income was $1.81 billion, up 6% versus the prior year, and adjusted operating income margins were 26.1%. Full year adjusted earnings were $6.83 per share, an increase of 7% over 2023's comparable adjusted earnings of $6.38 per share. AMETEK established annual records for sales, operating income, EBITDA, operating cash flow, free cash flow and both GAAP and adjusted earnings per share.</p><p class=\"\">A reconciliation of reported GAAP results to adjusted results is included in the financial tables accompanying this release and on the AMETEK website.</p><p class=\"\">Electronic Instruments Group (EIG)</p><p class=\"\">EIG sales in the fourth quarter were $1.21 billion, down 2% from the fourth quarter of 2023.

EMG's fourth quarter operating income was $111.2 million and operating income margins were 20.3% in the quarter.</p><p class=\"\">\"Overall EMG sales were up nicely in the quarter driven by the contributions from the acquisition of Paragon Medical and continued strong growth across our Aerospace and Defense businesses,\" stated Mr. Zapico. \"While this revenue growth was partially offset by the impact of the normalization of inventory levels across our OEM customer base, we were encouraged by our second consecutive quarter of strong organic order growth.\"</p><p class=\"\">2025 Outlook</p><p class=\"\">\"AMETEK delivered solid results in the fourth quarter and for the full year, demonstrating the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK Growth Model and the outstanding contributions from all AMETEK colleagues. We are well positioned as we enter 2025 with leading positions across a diverse set of attractive markets and significant balance sheet capacity to deploy on strategic acquisitions,\" noted Mr. Zapico.</p><p class=\"\">\"For 2025, we expect overall sales to be up low single digits on a percentage basis compared to 2024. Adjusted earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $7.02 to $7.18, an increase of 3% to 5% over the comparable basis for 2024,\" he added.</p><p class=\"\">\"For the first quarter of 2025, overall sales are expected to be roughly flat compared to the same period last year. Adjusted earnings in the quarter are anticipated to be in the range of $1.67 to $1.69 per share, up 2% to 3% compared to the first quarter of 2024,\" concluded Mr. Zapico.</p><p class=\"\">Conference Call</p><p class=\"\">AMETEK will webcast its fourth quarter 2024 investor conference call on Tuesday, February 4, 2025, beginning at 8:30 AM ET.

Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead reflect our expectations, estimates or projections concerning future results or events, including, without limitation, the future sales, gross margins, costs, earnings, cash flows, tax rates and performance of the Company. These statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"expectation,\" \"anticipate,\" \"may,\" \"could,\" \"will,\" \"intend,\" \"belief,\" \"estimate,\" \"plan,\" \"target,\" \"predict,\" \"likely,\" \"should,\" \"forecast,\" \"outlook,\" or other similar words or phrases. These statements are not guarantees of performance and are inherently subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by those statements. We cannot assure you that any of our expectations, estimates or projections will be achieved. The forward-looking statements included in this document are only made as of the date of this document and we disclaim any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. All forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty. Numerous factors could cause our actual results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements, including, without limitation:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Global economic and financial market conditions beyond our control might   materially and negatively impact us.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Competition in our product categories might hinder our ability to execute   our business strategy, achieve profitability, or maintain relationships   with existing customers.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Changes in the retail environment and consumer preferences could   adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of   operations.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Loss or impairment of the reputation of our Company or our leading brands   or failure of our marketing plans could have an adverse effect on our   business.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Loss of any of our principal customers could significantly decrease our   sales and profitability.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product,   marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to   competitive innovation and changing consumer habits.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">We are subject to risks related to our international operations,   including currency fluctuations, which could adversely affect our results   of operations.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">We must successfully manage the demand, supply, and operational   challenges brought on by any disease outbreak, including epidemics,   pandemics, or similar widespread public health concerns.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may   manufacture and market similar products, which could adversely affect our   market share and results of operations.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Changes in production costs, including raw material prices and   transportation costs, from inflation or otherwise, have adversely   affected, and in the future could erode, our profit margins and   negatively impact operating results.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Our reliance on certain significant suppliers subjects us to numerous   risks, including possible interruptions in supply, which could adversely   affect our business.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Our business is vulnerable to the availability of raw materials, our   ability to forecast customer demand and our ability to manage production   capacity.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">The manufacturing facilities, supply channels or other business   operations of the Company and our suppliers may be subject to disruption   from events beyond our control.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Our future results may be affected by our operational execution,   including our ability to achieve cost savings as a result of any current   or future restructuring efforts.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">If our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets become impaired,   we will be required to record impairment charges, which may be   significant.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Sales of certain of our products are seasonal and adverse weather   conditions during our peak selling seasons for certain auto care products   could have a material adverse effect.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">A failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact   our ability to conduct business.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">We rely significantly on information technology and any inadequacy,   interruption, theft or loss of data, malicious attack, integration   failure, failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of   sensitive data residing on our systems or other security failure of that   technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business and   damage the reputation of our brands.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">We may not be able to attract, retain and develop key employees, as well   as effectively manage human capital resources.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">We have significant debt obligations that could adversely affect our   business.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Our credit ratings are important to our cost of capital.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">We may experience losses or be subject to increased funding and expenses   related to our pension plans.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">The estimates and assumptions on which our financial projections are   based may prove to be inaccurate, which may cause our actual results to   materially differ from our projections, which may adversely affect our   future profitability, cash flows and stock price.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">If we pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures, we   might experience operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences   that may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results,   and we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions   or successfully integrate acquired businesses.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Our business involves the potential for product liability claims,   labeling claims, commercial claims and other legal claims against us,   which could affect our results of operations and financial condition and   result in product recalls or withdrawals.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Our business is subject to increasing government regulations in both the   U.S. and abroad that could impose material costs.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Increased focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations,   customers, consumers and shareholders on environmental, social and   governance (ESG) issues, including those related to sustainability and   climate change, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial   condition and results of operations and damage our reputation.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">We are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may expose us   to significant liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our   results of operations and financial condition. </li></ul><p class=\"\">In addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we consider immaterial could affect the accuracy of any such forward-looking

However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful comparisons to the corresponding historical or future period, and are used for management incentive compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that are not reflective of the Company's on-going operating performance, such as restructuring and related costs, network transition costs, acquisition and integration costs, impairment of intangible assets, a litigation matter, the loss on extinguishment of debt and the December 2023 Argentina Economic Reform. In addition, these measures help investors to analyze year over year comparability when excluding currency fluctuations as well as other Company initiatives that are not on-going.  We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are an enhancement to assist investors in understanding our business and in performing analysis consistent with financial models developed by research analysts. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in methods and in the items being adjusted.</p><p class=\"\">We provide the following non-GAAP measures and calculations, as well as the corresponding reconciliation to the closest GAAP measure in the following supplemental schedules:</p><p class=\"\">Segment Profit.  This amount represents the operations of our two reportable segments including allocations for shared support functions. General corporate and other expenses, amortization expense, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, other items, net, restructuring and related costs, network transition costs and acquisition and integration costs have all been excluded from segment profit.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings per Common Share (EPS).  These measures exclude the impact of restructuring and related costs, network transition costs, costs related to acquisition and integration, the loss on extinguishment of debt and the December 2023 Argentina Economic Reform.</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Tax Rate. This is the tax rate when excluding the pre-tax impact of restructuring and related costs, network transition costs, costs related to acquisition and integration, the loss on extinguishment of debt, and the December 2023 Argentina Economic Reform, as well as the related tax impact for these items, calculated utilizing the statutory rate for where the impact was incurred.</p><p class=\"\">Organic.  This is the non-GAAP financial measurement of the change in revenue or segment profit that excludes or otherwise adjusts for the change in hyperinflationary markets and impact of currency from the changes in foreign currency exchange rates as defined below:</p><p class=\"\">Change in hyperinflationary markets. The Company is presenting separately all changes in sales and segment profit from our Egypt and Argentina affiliates due to the designation of the economies as highly inflationary as of October 1, 2024 and July 1, 2018, respectively.</p><p class=\"\">Impact of currency. The Company evaluates the operating performance of our Company on a currency neutral basis. The Impact of Currency is the change in foreign currency exchange rates year-over-year on reported results, which is calculated by comparing the value of current year foreign operations at the current period USD exchange rate versus the value of current year foreign operations at the prior period USD exchange rate. The impact of currency also includes (gains)/losses of currency hedging programs, and it excludes hyperinflationary markets.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted Comparisons.  Detail for Adjusted Gross profit, Adjusted Gross margin, adjusted SG&amp;A and adjusted SG&amp;A as percent of Net sales and Adjusted Other items, net are also supplemental non-GAAP measure disclosures. These measures exclude the impact of restructuring and related costs, network transition costs, acquisition and integration costs and the December 2023 Argentina Economic Reform.</p><p class=\"\">EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as Net earnings before Income tax provision, Interest expense, the Loss on extinguishment of debt, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes the impact of the costs related to restructuring, network transition costs, a litigation matter, the December 2023 Argentina Economic Reform, impairment of intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, and share based payments.</p><p class=\"\">Free Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by capital expenditures, net of the proceeds from asset sales.</p><p class=\"\">Net Debt. Net Debt is defined as total Company debt, less Cash and cash equivalents.</p><p class=\"\">Currency-neutral. Currency-neutral excludes the Impact of currency as defined above on key measures. Hyper inflationary markets are excluded from this calculation.</p><p class=\"\">Energizer Holdings, Inc.</p><p class=\"\">Supplemental Schedules - Segment Information</p><p class=\"\">For the Quarter Ended December 31, 2024</p><p class=\"\">(In millions - Unaudited)</p><p class=\"\">Operations for Energizer are managed via two product segments: Batteries &amp; Lights and Auto Care. Energizer's operating model includes a combination of standalone and shared business functions between the product segments, varying by country and region of the world. Shared functions include the sales and marketing functions, as well as human resources, IT and finance shared service costs. Energizer applies a fully allocated cost basis, in which shared business functions are allocated between segments. Such allocations are estimates, and may not represent the costs of such services if performed on a standalone basis.
