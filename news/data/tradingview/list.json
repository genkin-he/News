While management maintains a cautious commercial outlook, the company’s Fit To Win cost savings initiatives should boost results. Net price will likely be a headwind due to competitive pressures in Europe, and sales volumes are projected to be flat or down slightly compared to 2024 levels. Although markets are expected to recover gradually, the company may choose to exit unprofitable businesses following restructuring actions and renewed focus on driving economic profit. Management anticipates lower operating costs due to between $175 and $200 million in Fit To Win benefits as well as higher production network utilization. Foreign currency translation will likely be an earnings headwind based on current exchange rates.</p><p class=\"\">O-I expects free cash flow of between $150 and $200 million in 2025, a significant improvement from the $128 million use of cash in 2024. Higher anticipated free cash flow is attributed to improved earnings as well as lower capital expenditures and tax payments, although restructuring cash outflows are expected to increase compared to the previous year. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be between $400 and $450 million, down significantly from $617 million in 2024.</p><p class=\"\">Guidance primarily reflects the company’s current view on sales and production volume, mix and working capital trends; it does not reflect potential impact of tariffs on U.S. imports or retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports. O-I’s adjusted earnings outlook assumes foreign currency rates as of January 31, 2025, and a full-year adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 33 to 36 percent. The earnings and cash flow guidance ranges may not fully reflect uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions, currency rates, energy and raw materials costs, supply chain disruptions, labor challenges, and success in global profitability improvement initiatives, among other factors.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Conference Call Scheduled for February 5, 2025</strong></p><p class=\"\">O-I CEO Gordon Hardie and CFO John Haudrich will conduct a conference call to discuss the company’s latest results on Wednesday, February 5, 2025, at 8:00 a.m. ET.

Management believes that its presentation and use of certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow, segment operating profit, segment operating profit margin, net debt and adjusted effective tax rate provide relevant and useful supplemental financial information that is widely used by analysts and investors, as well as by management in assessing both consolidated and business unit performance. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and should be considered supplemental in nature and should not be considered in isolation or be construed as being more important than comparable GAAP measures.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted earnings relates to net earnings (loss) attributable to the company, exclusive of items management considers not representative of ongoing operations and other adjustments because such items are not reflective of the company’s principal business activity, which is glass container production. Adjusted earnings are divided by weighted average shares outstanding (diluted) to derive adjusted earnings per share. Segment operating profit relates to earnings (loss) before interest expense, net, and before income taxes and is also exclusive of items management considers not representative of ongoing operations as well as certain retained corporate costs and other adjustments. Segment operating profit margin is calculated as segment operating profit divided by segment net sales. Adjusted effective tax rate relates to provision for income taxes, exclusive of items management considers not representative of ongoing operations and other adjustments divided by earnings (loss) before income taxes, exclusive of items management considers not representative of ongoing operations and other adjustments. Management uses adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, segment operating profit, segment operating profit margin, and adjusted effective tax rate to evaluate its period-over-period operating performance because it believes these provide useful supplemental measures of the results of operations of its principal business activity by excluding items that are not reflective of such operations.  The above non-GAAP financial measures may be useful to investors in evaluating the underlying operating performance of the company’s business as these measures eliminate items that are not reflective of its principal business activity.</p><p class=\"\">Net debt is defined as total debt less cash. Management uses net debt to analyze the liquidity of the company.</p><p class=\"\">Further, free cash flow relates to cash provided by operating activities less cash payments for property, plant, and equipment. Management has historically used free cash flow to evaluate its period-over-period cash generation performance because it believes these have provided useful supplemental measures related to its principal business activity. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures, since the company has mandatory debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from these measures. Management uses non-GAAP information principally for internal reporting, forecasting, budgeting and calculating compensation payments.</p><p class=\"\">The company routinely posts important information on its website – www.o-i.com/investors.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Forward-Looking Statements</strong></p><p class=\"\">This press release contains “forward-looking” statements related to O-I Glass, Inc.

Adjusted operating income was $169 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, compared with $182 million, or $1.16 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024 and $158 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2023.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">New insurance written (NIW) was approximately $13 billion, down 2% from the third quarter of 2024 primarily from seasonality partially offset by an estimated increase in refinance originations and up 27% from the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily driven by estimated higher originations. NIW for the current quarter was comprised of 96% monthly premium policies and 86% purchase originations.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Primary insurance in-force (IIF) was a record $269 billion, up from $268 billion in the third quarter of 2024 and up 2% from $263 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Persistency remained elevated at 82%, down slightly from 83% in the third quarter of 2024 and down from 86% in the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease year-over-year was primarily driven by a decline in mortgage rates in September 2024. Approximately 70% of our IIF had mortgage rates below 6%.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Net premiums earned were $246 million, down 1% from $249 million in the third quarter of 2024 and up 2% from $240 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Net premiums decreased sequentially, primarily driven by higher ceded premiums and increased year over year driven by premium growth from attractive adjacencies and growth in primary insurance in-force, partially offset by higher ceded premiums.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Losses incurred for the fourth quarter of 2024 were $24 million and the loss ratio was 10%, compared to $12 million and 5%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024 and $24 million and 10%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2023. The current quarter reserve release of $56 million from favorable cure performance and loss mitigation activities compares to a reserve release of $65 million and $53 million in the third quarter of 2024 and fourth quarter of 2023, respectively. The sequential increase in losses and the loss ratio were primarily driven by a lower reserve release and new delinquencies are up 1% excluding hurricane-related delinquencies.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Operating expenses in the current quarter were $58 million and the expense ratio was 24%. This compared to $56 million and 22%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024 and $59 million and 25%, respectively in the fourth quarter of 2023. The sequential increase was driven by incentive-based compensation while the year-over-year decrease was driven in part by the impact of our cost reduction initiatives.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Net investment income was $63 million, up from $61 million in the third quarter of 2024 and $56 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, driven by the continuation of elevated interest rates and higher average invested assets.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Net investment loss in the quarter was $(7) million, as compared to $(1) million sequentially and $(1) million in the same period last year. The current period was primarily driven by the identification of assets that upon selling allow us to recoup losses through higher net investment income.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Annualized return on equity for the fourth quarter of 2024 was 13.0% and annualized adjusted operating return on equity was 13.5%. This compares to third quarter 2024 results of 14.7% and 14.8%, respectively, and to fourth quarter 2023 results of 13.8% and 13.9%, respectively.</li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Capital and Liquidity </strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">We returned $354 million to shareholders in 2024 inclusive of quarterly dividends and share repurchases.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">During the quarter, we announced two quota share reinsurance agreements with a panel of highly-rated reinsurers that will cede approximately 27% of a portion of expected new insurance written for the 2025 and 2026 book years.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">As previously announced, we paid approximately $28 million, or $0.185 per share, dividend in the fourth quarter.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">For the full year 2024, we repurchased 7.6 million shares at a weighted average share price of $31.95 for a total of $243 million.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">EMICO completed a distribution of approximately $230 million in the fourth quarter that will primarily be used to support our ability to return capital to shareholders and bolster financial flexibility.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Enact Holdings, Inc. held $243 million of cash and cash equivalents plus $298 million of invested assets as of December 31, 2024. Combined cash and invested assets increased $98 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to a contribution from EMICO, partially offset by share buybacks and our quarterly dividend.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">PMIERs sufficiency was 167% and $2.1 billion above the PMIERs requirements, compared to 173% and $2.2 billion above the PMIERs requirements in the third quarter of 2024.</li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Recent Events </strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">In January 2025, Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) upgraded the Insurer Financial Strength rating for EMICO to A from A- and also upgraded Enact’s senior debt rating to BBB.

These forward-looking statements may address, among other things, our expected financial and operational results, the related assumptions underlying our expected results, guidance concerning the future return of capital and the quotations of management. These forward-looking statements are distinguished by use of words such as “will,” “may,” “would,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “believe,” “designed,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “target,” “could,” “should,” or “intend,” the negative of these terms, and similar references to future periods. These views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements contained herein speak only as of the date of this press release. Factors or events that we cannot predict, including risks related to an economic downturn or a recession in the United States and in other countries around the world; changes in political, business, regulatory, and economic conditions; changes in or to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the “GSEs”), whether through Federal legislation, restructurings or a shift in business practices; failure to continue to meet the mortgage insurer eligibility requirements of the GSEs; competition for customers; lenders or investors seeking alternatives to private mortgage insurance; an increase in the number of loans insured through Federal government mortgage insurance programs, including those offered by the Federal Housing Administration; and other factors described in the risk factors contained in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC, may cause our actual results to differ from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Although Enact believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Enact can give no assurance that its expectations will be achieved and it undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">GAAP/Non-GAAP Disclosure Discussion</strong></p><p class=\"\">This communication includes the non-GAAP financial measures entitled “adjusted operating income (loss)”, “adjusted operating income (loss) per share,\" and “adjusted operating return on equity.\" Adjusted operating income (loss) per share is derived from adjusted operating income (loss). The chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and allocates resources on the basis of adjusted operating income (loss). Enact Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) defines adjusted operating income (loss) as net income (loss) excluding the after-tax effects of net investment gains (losses), restructuring costs and infrequent or unusual non-operating items, and gain (loss) on the extinguishment of debt. The Company excludes net investment gains (losses), gains (losses) on the extinguishment of debt and infrequent or unusual non-operating items because the Company does not consider them to be related to the operating performance of the Company and other activities. The recognition of realized investment gains or losses can vary significantly across periods as the activity is highly discretionary based on the timing of individual securities sales due to such factors as market opportunities or exposure management. Trends in the profitability of our fundamental operating activities can be more clearly identified without the fluctuations of these realized gains and losses. We do not view them to be indicative of our fundamental operating activities. Therefore, these items are excluded from our calculation of adjusted operating income. In addition, adjusted operating income (loss) per share is derived from adjusted operating income (loss) divided by shares outstanding. Adjusted operating return on equity is calculated as annualized adjusted operating income for the period indicated divided by the average of current period and prior periods’ ending total stockholders’ equity.</p><p class=\"\">While some of these items may be significant components of net income (loss) in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company believes that adjusted operating income (loss) and measures that are derived from or incorporate adjusted operating income (loss), including adjusted operating income (loss) per share on a basic and diluted basis and adjusted operating return on equity, are appropriate measures that are useful to investors because they identify the income (loss) attributable to the ongoing operations of the business. Management also uses adjusted operating income (loss) as a basis for determining awards and compensation for senior management and to evaluate performance on a basis comparable to that used by analysts. Adjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income (loss) per share on a basic and diluted basis are not substitutes for net income (loss) available to Enact Holdings, Inc.’s common stockholders or net income (loss) available to Enact Holdings, Inc.’s common stockholders per share on a basic and diluted basis determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, the Company’s definition of adjusted operating income (loss) may differ from the definitions used by other companies.</p><p class=\"\">Adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) available to Enact Holdings, Inc.’s common stockholders to adjusted operating income (loss) assume a 21% tax rate.</p><p class=\"\">The tables at the end of this press release provide a reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted operating income (loss) and U.S. GAAP return on equity to adjusted operating return on equity for the three months and twelve months ending December 31, 2024 and 2023, as well as for the three months ended September 30, 2024</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Exhibit A: </strong>Consolidated Statements of Income (amounts in thousands, except per share

Non-GAAP Information</strong></p><p class=\"\">Funds from Operations</p><p class=\"\">The company calculates FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). FFO represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.</p><p class=\"\">FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring the company's operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year-over-year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. The company also believes that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare the company's operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the company's properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of the company's properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact the company's results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of the company's performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as the company does, and, accordingly, the company's FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of the company's performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of the company's liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company's cash needs, including the company's ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. FFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.</p><p class=\"\">Cash Net Operating Income</p><p class=\"\">The company uses NOI internally to evaluate and compare the operating performance of the company's properties. The company believes cash NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the company's financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level, and when compared across periods, can be used to determine trends in earnings of the company's properties as this measure is not affected by (1) the non-cash revenue and expense recognition items, (2) the cost of funds of the property owner, (3) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP or (4) general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to the property owner. The company believes the exclusion of these items from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating the company's properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. Cash NOI is a measure of the operating performance of the company's properties but does not measure the company's performance as a whole. Cash NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income as computed in accordance with GAAP.</p><p class=\"\">Cash NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. The company defines cash NOI as operating revenues (rental income, tenant reimbursements (other than tenant improvement reimbursements), ground lease rental income and other property income) less property and related expenses (property expenses, ground lease expense, property marketing costs, real estate taxes and insurance), adjusted for non-cash revenue and operating expense items such as straight-line rent, amortization of lease intangibles, amortization of lease incentives and other adjustments. Cash NOI also excludes lease termination fees, tenant improvement reimbursements, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other nonproperty income and losses, acquisition-related expense, gains and losses from property dispositions, extraordinary items, tenant improvements, and leasing commissions. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating cash NOI, and accordingly, the company's cash NOI may not be comparable to the cash NOIs of other REITs.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About American Assets Trust, Inc.</strong></p><p class=\"\">American Assets Trust, Inc. is a full service, vertically integrated and self-administered real estate investment trust (\"REIT\"), headquartered in San Diego, California.

As we respond to the evolving housing environment, we will continue to remain nimble and execute our differentiated strategy — including investing in technology and accelerating product innovation — while delivering sustained value for all our stakeholders.\"</p><p class=\"\">Third Quarter Fiscal 2025 Results</p><p class=\"\">Net sales for the third quarter fiscal 2025 increased 15.3% to $644.9 million compared to the prior-year period. The number of U.S. homes sold in the third quarter fiscal 2025 increased 14.1% to 6,437 driven by an increase in demand across all sales channels. The ASP per U.S. home sold increased 2.8% to $94,900 due to an increase in the number of units sold through company-owned retail sales centers during the quarter. The number of Canadian factory-built homes sold in the quarter decreased to 209 homes compared to 249 homes in the prior-year period due to softening demand in certain markets.</p><p class=\"\">Gross profit increased by 28.1% to $181.0 million in the third quarter fiscal 2025 compared to the prior-year period. Gross profit margin was 28.1% of net sales, a 280-basis point expansion compared to 25.3% in the third quarter fiscal 2024. Gross margin expansion reflects higher ASPs on new homes sold through company-owned retail sales centers which also generated a greater percentage of total revenue in addition to lower input costs and acquisition synergy capture when compared to the prior-year period.</p><p class=\"\">Selling, general, and administrative expenses (\"SG&amp;A\") in the third quarter fiscal 2025 increased to $108.2 million from $85.1 million in the same period last year. SG&amp;A during the quarter increased due to higher variable compensation from higher sales volumes and profitability as well as investments in people and information systems to support future growth. SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales was 16.8%, compared to 15.2% in the prior year period.</p><p class=\"\">Net income increased by 31.0% to $61.5 million for the third quarter fiscal 2025 compared to the prior-year period. The increase in net income was driven by higher sales and gross profit partially offset by higher SG&amp;A in the quarter.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter fiscal 2025 increased by 25.7% to $83.3 million compared to the third quarter fiscal 2024. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 12.9%, compared to 11.8% in the prior-year period.</p><p class=\"\">As of December 28, 2024, Champion Homes had $581.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $11.5 million in the current quarter. The Company repurchased and retired $20 million of its common stock during the third quarter under the previously announced repurchase program. On January 30, 2025, the Board of Directors refreshed the share repurchase authorization to provide for $100 million of potential future repurchases.</p><p class=\"\">Conference Call and Webcast Information:</p><p class=\"\">Champion Homes' management will host a conference call tomorrow, February 5, 2025, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time, to discuss Champion Homes' financial results and an update on current operations.</p><p class=\"\">Investors and other interested parties can listen to a webcast of the live conference call by logging onto the Investor Relations section of Champion Homes' website at ir.championhomes.com.

Champion Homes uses these Non-GAAP Financial Measures for business planning purposes and in measuring its performance relative to that of its competitors. Champion Homes believes that these Non-GAAP Financial Measures are useful financial metrics to assess its operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that Champion Homes believes are not representative of its core business. These Non-GAAP Financial Measures are not intended to replace, and should not be considered superior to, the presentation of Champion Homes' financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP.</p><p class=\"\">Champion Homes defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss attributable to Champion Homes, Inc. plus expenses or minus income, (a) the provision for income taxes, (b) interest income or expense, net, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations, (e) non-cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets, (f) equity in net earnings or losses of ECN, (g) charges related to the remediation of the water intrusion product liability claims; and (h) other non-operating income and costs, including but not limited to those costs for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses, including the change in fair value of contingent consideration, and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales reported in the income statements.</p><p class=\"\">Champion Homes defines Adjusted Net Income as net income or loss attributable to Champion Homes, Inc. plus expenses or minus income (net of tax where applicable), (a) gain or loss from discontinued operations, (b) non-cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets, (c) equity in net earnings or losses of ECN, (d) charges related to the remediation of estimated water intrusion product liability, and (e) other non-operating income or expense including, but not limited to those costs for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses, including the change in fair value of contingent consideration, and idle facilities. Champion Homes defines Adjusted EPS as Adjusted Net Income divided by shares outstanding.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are not measures of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss, net sales, operating income or earnings per share prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. These Non-GAAP Financial Measures do not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities as defined by U.S. GAAP. Champion Homes believes that similar Non-GAAP Financial Measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate its performance and that of its competitors. However, Champion Homes use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures may vary from that of others in its industry. The Non-GAAP Financial Measures are reconciled from the respective measure under U.S. GAAP in the tables below.</p><p class=\"\">Forward-Looking Statements</p><p class=\"\">Statements in this press release, including certain statements regarding Champion Homes' strategic initiatives, and future market demand are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for \"forward-looking statements\" provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
