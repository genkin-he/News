Agricultural research firm SovEcon says that the average domestic price for Russian wheat has risen to 15,526 rubles, or $158 per metric ton. In U.S. dollars, that's up 9% since the start of the year, according to SovEcon. The firm says that exporters have been increasingly buying up Russian wheat in recent months, supporting the higher price. However, exports fell back in January, SovEcon says — and Russia's ability to supply wheat to the world may prove to be weaker in 2025 due to troubled weather this winter. CBOT wheat is up 1.1%.

Year-end profit for the Vienna-based bank including Russia and Belarus came to 1.16 billion euros, better than Citi had anticipated, the analyst says. Citi says that the bank's result excluding Russia and Belarus, given the number of one-offs the bank faced including a provision and the effect of deconsolidating its Belarus business, is largely in line with expectations.

The slight fall in the bank's 2025 return on tangible equity to 11.5% from a range of 11.5% to 12% previously, given consensus expectations at 10.4%, should offer relief to investors fearing a steeper downgrade.

BNP Paribas's investment and protection services unit disappointed but the business should benefit later this year from external growth, the analyst says.

The bulk of the banks' earnings, which remain supported by net interest income, is expected to stay resilient amid the high-for-longer interest rate environment, he writes. The banks' 4Q loan momentum may also see some pick-up, with data suggesting that overall loans have risen in December from November, he says. Higher confidence around the economy with Singapore's low unemployment rate could have partly contributed to an improvement in lending conditions, Yeap adds. (amanda.lee@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

They include a 15%-20% decline in current coal prices, UBS says, noting 45% of Origin's coal costs are unhedged. Origin also wants to expand a battery at the Eraring power station in Australia to become one of the largest battery storage systems in the world. \"We do not believe these incremental earnings (A$100 million per annum from 2H FY 2026) are factored into consensus estimates,\" UBS says.

CPKC has 41% of its revenue tied to cross-border trade, according to RBC. Sustained tariffs, the analysts say, over a longer period of time could derail its growth plans. \"Moreover, we see many of the company's Investor Day growth targets as dependent on cross-border trade and therefore flag risk to long-term consensus EPS growth estimates should tariffs at current levels be sustained,\" the analysts say.

The Canadian Automotive Partnership Council in a meeting with Canadian lawmakers warned tariffs pose an existential threat to the industry in Canada and the U.S. and costs ultimately being borne by consumers. The industry body notes bilateral automotive trade is balanced, with Canadian exports to the U.S. at C$82 billion and imports at C$79 billion in 2023. And it stresses Canadian-made vehicles don't pose a threat to U.S. automotive jobs or production mandates: fewer than 10% of vehicles sold in the U.S. are produced in Canada, whereas the U.S. assembles about half of the vehicles sold in Canada and exports more vehicles to Canada than to any other country.

A 10% universal tariff imposed by the U.S. might shave 0.1% to 0.2% off eurozone GDP, he says in a note. But a 25% tariff, as imposed but suspended on Canada and Mexico, would have a more-than-proportionately larger effect because it would be harder for companies and exchange-rate moves to cushion the blow, Kenningham warns. A ball-park estimate is that would cut eurozone GDP by around 0.5%, leaving growth close to zero this year.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Evie Liu</p><p class=\"\">PepsiCo beat Wall Street estimates for profit in the fourth quarter but missed on revenue. The stock is falling on Tuesday, but some analysts say shares in the snack and beverage giant could bounce back as it invests in new products and further expands internationally.</p><p class=\"\">The maker of Pepsi and Mountain Dew sodas said on Tuesday that adjusted earnings per share were $1.96 in the final three months of 2024. Analysts polled by FactSet expected earnings of $1.94. Revenue came in at $27.78 billion, slightly below the expectations of $27.89 billion.</p><p class=\"\">Pepsi's revenue was hurt by subdued trends in the North America market, with numbers particularly disappointing in the Quaker Foods business, which suffered from a fallout due to product recalls in 2024.</p><p class=\"\">Pepsi shares tumbled 4.4% to around $144 in Tuesday trading, on pace for largest percent decrease since Oct. 5, 2023, when it fell 5.2%. The stock has declined 16% over the past 12 months.</p><p class=\"\">Still, while sales came slightly lower than a year ago, fourth-quarter earnings were up 14% on a constant currency basis.</p><p class=\"\">\"Our enhanced multiyear productivity initiatives enabled us to invest in our businesses, and deliver improvements in our gross margin, operating margin expansion and EPS in 2024,\" said CEO Ramon Laguarta in a statement.</p><p class=\"\">Pepsi, along with many packaged-food companies, has faced some challenges over the past year. Consumers are pulling back from spending amid inflation pressure, while the rising popularity of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs could further dampen appetite for snacks and sugary drinks.</p><p class=\"\">This year, Donald Trump's administration might bring more changes that could negatively affect the food industry, including more prominent labels about harmful ingredients, restrictions on food additives, and cuts to the food stamp program that many low-income households rely on for consumption.</p><p class=\"\">On top of the regulatory pressure, there is also a general trend toward healthier foods. Pepsi's most popular products have historically catered to taste rather than health. The company has been working to evolve its portfolio toward more health and wellness options.</p><p class=\"\">Laguarta said the company will continue to expand in international business, while improving performance in North America. He expects the productivity initiatives to help fund investments and aid profitability.</p><p class=\"\">For 2025, management expects a low-single-digit increase in organic revenue and a mid-single-digit increase in core constant currency earnings per share.</p><p class=\"\">Weaker foreign currencies are expected to hurt revenue and earnings by about three percentage points, the company said. That means a low-single-digit increase to core earnings per share in 2025 compared with 2024 results of $8.16.</p><p class=\"\">Pepsi announced a 5% increase in annualized dividend per share, beginning with the June 2025 payment. Total cash returns to shareholders in 2025 are guided at $8.6 billion, comprised of dividends of $7.6 billion and share repurchases of $1 billion.</p><p class=\"\">Some analysts say uncertainties facing Pepsi might be priced in, and the company is better positioned than peers to grow in the coming years.</p><p class=\"\">\"Pepsi's diversified product offering, which includes globally known brands in snacks and beverages, is often a competitive advantage, as it provides a nice mix of at- and away-from-home products,\" wrote Edward Jones analyst Brittany Quatrochi in a Tuesday note.</p><p class=\"\">The analyst noted that Pepsi's product innovation has driven solid growth in snacks, and it's improving with beverages. With nearly 40% of its sales outside of North America, Pepsi is also geographically diverse.</p><p class=\"\">\"International growth, especially in emerging markets, should benefit Pepsi,\" she wrote. \"Usually when people reach the middle class in those markets, they tend to spend more on packaged beverages and snacks.\"</p><p class=\"\">Pepsi's strong distribution system could help it gain share in those growing markets versus smaller competitors, said Quatrochi, who has a Buy rating for the stock and expects Pepsi to grow earnings at a high-single-digit rate.</p><p class=\"\">Garrett Nelson, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research also maintained his Buy rating on the stock, but trimmed the 12-month price target to $175 from $190.</p><p class=\"\">Pepsi has a \"masterful track record of providing conservative guidance and then exceeding it,\" he wrote. Despite headwinds, Nelson sees value in Pepsi shares at current levels following the recent slide.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires throughout the day.</p><p class=\"\">1149 ET - Base metal prices rise, with LME three-month copper up 0.5% at $9,158.50 a metric ton and LME three-month aluminum up 0.6% at $2,636.50 a ton. The market has bounced back from losses incurred by President Trump's proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which have been postponed a month after last-minute agreements on Monday. An additional 10% China tariff has proceeded. This has eased market worries of reduced industrial growth and demand. Canada and Mexico are significant suppliers to the U.S. across the whole base-metals complex, ranging from around 20% of copper imports to nearly half of its aluminum imports. News of the delay also sent the U.S. dollar lower, a tailwind for metals as it becomes cheaper for international buyers to purchase dollar-denominated commodities. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1141 ET - Gold futures rise, having set a fresh record slightly earlier in the session. Futures are up 0.5% at $2,871.60 a troy ounce, having peaked at $2,874.50 in European late afternoon trading. The precious metal has traded in a relatively narrow range, with rising U.S. bond yields and a stronger dollar limiting the upward rally, XS.com's Rania Gule says in a note. That said, concerns about potential economic fallout from President Trump's tariffs and other inflationary policies provide strong support for gold as a safe-haven asset, Gule writes. The overall upward trend for gold remains intact, and any corrective pullbacks should be seen as buying opportunities as supportive factors haven't fundamentally changed, Gule says. As markets remain uncertain, gold will likely stay a focus for investors both as a hedge and an investment opportunity, Gule adds. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1132 ET - JBS, the world's largest meatpacker, says it's investing $200 million in two of its largest U.S. beef plants at a time when meatpackers are broadly struggling to make a profit because of a lack of cattle, driving up costs. The company said $150 million will go to its Cactus, Texas, plant to improve the part of the facility where carcasses are processed into primal cuts and expand its ground beef room. JBS says it will put $50 million toward its Greeley, Colo., plant to build a new distribution center. JBS said the investments will improve efficiencies and could increase production capacity at the two plants that both have the capability to slaughter about 6,000 cattle a day. \"We believe now is the time to invest in the United States,\" said Wesley Batista Filho, JBS' U.S. CEO. (patrick.thomas@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1127 ET - U.S. farmers carried an optimistic outlook into 2025, according to the latest Ag Economy Barometer published by Purdue University and the CME Group. Surveyed farmers say that their view of current conditions of the agricultural economy have improved, buoyed by a month of gains for row crop prices on the CBOT. Farmers are increasingly expecting to have a 'more robust' year financially than last year — although some concerns remain. Some 42% of surveyed farmers identified trade policy as their top policy concern over the next five years. Even so, 40% of farmers now say a trade war is likely or very likely, down 8 points from last month's survey. Some 29% say a trade war is unlikely or very unlikely, which is an 8 point increase from last month. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1042 ET - Grain merchant ADM says as part of its plan to cut costs it could shutter or divest facilities that are in need of repair, have a history of poor performance or are located in areas with excess capacity. CEO Juan Luciano said on a call with investors that the company has identified about $2 billion worth of opportunities. The company is facing pressure from low crop prices and falling profit margins in its oilseed processing business. \"We will execute on this over time,\" Luciano said. (patrick.thomas@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1010 ET - Lean hog futures on the CME are higher in early trading, with the most-active contract up 0.8%. Traders appear to be pulling back from the steep selling seen to start the week, with contract limits in today's session extended to 6 cents a pound after the limit-down close Monday, following a drop of 4 cents a pound. While the hog market recalibrates amid tariff turmoil, there exists fundamental pressure points for hog demand. Pork carcass cutout prices shed 94 cents per hundredweight on Monday, according to USDA data, following a strong start to 2025 pricewise. Live cattle futures are down 0.2%. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0952 ET - CBOT grain futures are mixed, with traders maintaining a reserved approach as China responds to Trump tariffs with retaliatory measures of its own targeting energy exports among other things. The tariffs make no mention of raw soybeans, but traders are wondering nonetheless about whether China will curb its purchases. \"Remember, we are looking to see if there is any new commodity buying by China, versus just 'maneuvering to avoid tariffs,\" says Naomi Blohm of Total Farm Marketing in a note. The USDA announced a new flash sale of corn to South Korea for 132,000 metric tons. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0936 ET - U.S. natural gas futures hand back some of the previous day's gains as weather forecasts continue to vary over how cold February is likely to be. China announced a 15% tariff to be placed on imports of U.S. LNG as of Feb. 10, in response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. \"In the immediate term, Chinese offtakers may shy away from U.S.-sourced spot LNG purchases--but U.S. LNG may simply backfill other Asian supply that China lifts instead,\" Eli Rubin of EBW Analytics says in a note. The tariffs could affect longer-term contracting, however, he adds. The Nymex front month is down 5.2% at $3.177/mmBtu. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0928 ET - New U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods were met with retaliation from China, resulting in selling in CBOT soybean futures overnight. But that selling has moderated, with the most-active soybean contract now down only 0.3% pre-market. Traders who have spoken to WSJ say that a lot of market activity has become reactive to new headlines, but is showing restraint in light of trade uncertainty. \"I think the trade is well braced for this,\" says Terry Reilly of Marex. Reilly adds that many traders likely \"learned their lesson\" after handling the fallout of the trade war with China in Trump's first term. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0922 ET - The dollar recovers some ground after yesterday's choppy session, which ended with a small decline in the WSJ Dollar Index as tariffs on Mexico and Canada were delayed. The trade war with China goes on and markets remain worried about the potential fallout of a prolonged period in which tariffs would loom over the global economy. BBH says in a report that investors should look through the noise and focus on the fact that the U.S. still has strong growth and elevated inflation, \"and a more hawkish Fed continues to favor higher U.S. yields and a stronger dollar.\" The greenback strengthens 0.3 against the yen and is stable versus the euro. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)</p><p class=\"\">0910 ET - Oil futures are lower as China retaliates against U.S. tariffs with duties on U.S. exports including oil and LNG, to take effect Feb. 10. The tariff is particularly negative for WTI, says TP ICAP's Scott Shelton in a note. \"I would assume with a $7 tax roughly, that arb is firmly shut and WTI will have to go elsewhere in the next few months as we go into turnarounds.\" U.S. refineries reduce their crude use during the maintenance season, leading to builds in U.S. crude stocks. WTI is down 2.7% at $71.16 a barrel. Brent is 1.8% lower at $74.61 a barrel. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0853 ET - ADM falls 2% premarket after saying it expects an uncertain 2025 and posts a 6% decline in sales for the quarter ending Dec. 31 compared with a year ago, and below analyst estimates. ADM says operating profit at its crushing subsegment, which turns oilseeds into oils and biofuels, was 46% lower versus the prior year quarter, because of higher manufacturing costs among other issues. \"With softer market conditions and policy uncertainty around the world going into 2025, we are focused on improving our operational performance, accelerating costs savings, and simplifying our portfolio,\" says ADM CEO Juan Luciano in a statement.
