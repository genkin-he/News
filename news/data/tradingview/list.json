            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Mackenzie Tatananni</p><p class=\"\">Trump Media and Technology Group's decision to use Moov Financial to handle its payment-processing services marks the start of an unlikely partnership.</p><p class=\"\">Moov is \"committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills and we embrace diversity, creativity, and equal opportunity,\" according to a job posting dated Feb. 1. Those values are seemingly at odds with those of Trump Media's majority shareholder, President Donald Trump, who has made quashing diversity, equity, and inclusion an objective of his administration.</p><p class=\"\">Neither Moov nor Trump Media immediately responded to requests for comment. In a statement Monday, Moov CEO Wade Arnold praised Trump Media for \"building a dynamic platform for free expression.\"</p><p class=\"\">On Monday, Trump Media said it had signed an agreement with Moov to handle payment processing for its Truth Social platform and video streaming service Truth+. The company's Truth. Fi fintech services brand, which is expected to roll out later this year, will also use Moov's secure payment processing, Trump Media said.</p><p class=\"\">Moov, founded in 2017 as an open-source fintech platform, is also the organizer of fintech_devcon, an annual developer conference. In 2021, Moov unveiled a \"diversity scholarship\" that would allow recipients from \"underrepresented communities\" to attend the first of those conferences.</p><p class=\"\">According to a profile on Built In, a tech-oriented job board, Moov boasts a \"dedicated diversity and inclusion staff\" as well as an equal-pay policy and required unconscious-bias training. The same profile mentions \"hiring practices that promote diversity,\" including partnerships with \"diversity-focused communities and recruiting platforms.\"</p><p class=\"\">All that contrasts with actions taken by Trump, the majority owner of Trump Media Group, since he was sworn into office on Jan. 20.</p><p class=\"\">On Jan. 22, Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to \"end illegal DEI\" and terminate so-called DEI discrimination in the federal workforce. The mandate revoked Executive Order 11246, which was signed by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965 to establish requirements for nondiscriminatory hiring practices for government contractors.</p><p class=\"\">In an order issued Jan. 27, Trump eliminated DEI offices and policies within the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security, claiming \"the Armed Forces have been afflicted with radical gender ideology.\"</p><p class=\"\">The president also appeared to blame diversity initiatives at the Federal Aviation Administration for the midair collision that killed 67 people in Washington, D.C., last week. During a press conference on Jan. 30, Trump claimed, without evidence, that the Biden administration allowed people with intellectual and psychiatric impairments to work for the FAA.</p><p class=\"\">Trump appeared to walk back his remarks later that day, saying DEI \"may have\" contributed to the crash. But the White House released a memo doubling down on claims that the Biden administration \"egregiously rejected merit-based hiring,\" which led to the FAA recruiting people with \"severe intellectual disabilities.\"</p><p class=\"\">Truth Social positioned itself as an alternative to Twitter and Facebook when it launched in 2022. The platform says it provides a safe harbor from censorship by large tech corporations and that it is free of political discrimination.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Traders and farmers hope that the administration is using tariff threats as leverage in trade negotiations, as opposed to following through with a major disruption to agricultural trade.</p><p class=\"\">\"I think after last time, people learned their lesson,\" said Terry Reilly, head grains and oilseeds analyst with Marex in Chicago. \"I think the trade is well braced for this.\"</p><p class=\"\">Grain futures trading in Chicago settled higher Tuesday, continuing the positive momentum that grain futures have all had since the start of the year, with corn rising 8%, soybeans up 6%, and wheat up 5% since Jan. 1.</p><p class=\"\">The trade war between the U.S. and China that raged during Trump's first term cut into U.S. exports, particularly for soybeans - with export sales of U.S. soybeans to top buyer China falling by over 60% from 2017 to 2019, according to data from the Department of Agriculture.</p><p class=\"\">There were many stops and starts in the negotiations leading to a partial trade deal between the two nations in late 2019, which called for increased purchasing of U.S. exports by China.</p><p class=\"\">This time, traders and analysts appear ready for the potential chaos that may ensue in negotiations between both sides. Grain traders are moving carefully in recent sessions, limiting the amount of fluctuation seen in futures prices.</p><p class=\"\">\"It appears that the trade is reluctant to price in a tariff premium or discount given the speed of developments,\" said Jake Hanley, managing director and senior portfolio specialist with Burlington, Vt.-based Teucrium Trading LLC.</p><p class=\"\">The fluid nature of the news coming out of the White House has traders glued to news coverage and Trump's Truth Social account, where he provided confirmation about Mexican and Canadian tariffs being delayed.</p><p class=\"\">In the case of China, retaliatory tariffs didn't target U.S. agriculture, outside of agricultural equipment coming out of the country. The measure focused on other mostly energy commodities, including oil, gas and coal.</p><p class=\"\">Farmers nationwide have become more positive about their chances to have a profitable year in 2025 and that a trade war can be avoided. In a survey conducted jointly by Purdue University and the CME Group and released this month, a growing percentage of farmers say that they don't believe a new trade war is coming - with 29% of the population calling it 'unlikely' or 'very unlikely', up 8 points from the previous month.</p><p class=\"\">Meanwhile, 40% see a potential trade war as 'likely' or 'very likely', but that's down 8 points from the previous month.</p><p class=\"\">\"Recent improvements in crop and livestock prices have provided a boost to farmers' current sentiment,\" said Michael Langemeier, the principal investigator for the barometer and a professor at Purdue's school for Commercial Agriculture, in the release.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Kirk Maltais at kirk.maltais@wsj.com</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Joy Wiltermuth</p><p class=\"\">It still pays to stick with shorter-term bonds, but concerns about growth are back</p><p class=\"\">President Trump's trade-war tactics have been tough for investors to parse, especially as stocks zigzagged to start the week amid mixed message from the bond market.</p><p class=\"\">Shorter 2-year Treasurys yields BX:TMUBMUSD02Y on Tuesday were near 4.21%, only slightly below their 200-day moving average, according to FactSet data. Longer 10-year yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Ywere closer to 4.51%, far above their average for the same time frame.</p><p class=\"\">Tracking yields over longer stretches can help establish trends. The curious thing, however, is that both of these yields remain comfortably above levels from late August, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the time had come for rate cuts.</p><p class=\"\">It also comes despite warnings from Wall Street last year that investors should lock in yields before rate cuts ruin the opportunity. But the Fed already has cut its short-term policy rate by 1 percentage point since September.</p><p class=\"\">\"There are two narratives the bond market is wrestling with,\" said Lawrence Gillum, chief income strategist at LPL Research, in a phone interview Tuesday.</p><p class=\"\">Yields on Treasurys that mature in two years or less reflect concerns about potential price increases and the Federal Reserve's careful approach to rate cuts, Gillum said.</p><p class=\"\">Yet another recent theme relates to tariffs, and how they tend to increase prices, but also slow economic growth. Gillum expects Trump's tariffs to apply downward pressure on 10-year yields, bringing them down to the low 4% range in the back-end of the year, as investors react to growth concerns.</p><p class=\"\">See: The tariff wars aren't over. China hits back over new 10% tariffs.</p><p class=\"\">How should investors be positioned now? The biggest \"bang for your buck,\" on a yield per duration basis for the Bloomberg Corporate Index, would be to keep exposure in bonds short, according to Gillum.</p><p class=\"\">The chart looks at different bond maturity buckets from the corporate index, helping to measure the sensitivity a bond portfolio may have to rate changes over time.</p><p class=\"\">\"Right now the economy is in good shape, but it probably [won't be] toward the end of the year,\" Gillum told MarketWatch. \"If you are managing a fixed-income portfolio relative to an industry index, and trying to outperform, our advice is stay neutral. Don't take a lot of rate risk, until we see the economic data soften.\"</p><p class=\"\">Meanwhile, \"there's a lot of value in the front-end,\" Gillum said, adding that it's still possible to collect around 4.5% on shorter-duration bonds, higher than seen much of the past decade.</p><p class=\"\">Trump's start-stop strategy on tariffs adds other risks for investors to consider. BofA analysts estimate that the S&amp;P 500 index SPX could see as much of an 8% hit to earnings per share from 25% tariffs on Mexico and China and 10% incremental tariffs on China.</p><p class=\"\">See: As Trump's tariffs grip markets, a key indicator flashes a warning for bullish investors</p><p class=\"\">Concerns about stocks stumbling from near record highs would bolster the case for owning bonds in a portfolio, but investors also don't want to wait for potentially drastic Fed rate cuts and a faltering economy to add duration.</p><p class=\"\">\"The big takeaway,\" according to Gillum, is that \"volatility in fixed-income isn't going to go away.\"</p><p class=\"\">The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.8% on Tuesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA was 0.4% higher and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP was up 1.2%, according to FactSet.</p><p class=\"\">Related: Stock-market investors are getting nervous about this bond-market move that's only happened twice in over 40 years</p><p class=\"\">-Joy Wiltermuth</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Nicholas Jasinski</p><p class=\"\">The Federal Reserve's Mary Daly is in no rush to lower interest rates until inflation is closing in on the central bank's 2% target.</p><p class=\"\">A solid economic backdrop gives the Fed the luxury of time to hold policy where it is until disinflation progress resumes, the San Francisco Fed President said on Tuesday. \"[The economy] came into 2025 in a very good place,\" Daly said at an event hosted by the Commonwealth Club World Affairs of California.</p><p class=\"\">\"Growth is solid, the labor market is solid, and inflation is coming down, albeit gradually, but we're heading toward our 2% target.\"</p><p class=\"\">Daly has led the San Francisco Fed since 2018. She was a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policymaking body, in 2024, before rotating off the voting list in 2025. The San Francisco Fed will next get a vote in 2027.</p><p class=\"\">The FOMC held its target for the federal-funds rate at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% at its January meeting. It cut rates by a total of a percentage point at its final three meetings of 2024.</p><p class=\"\">Daly sees the positive economic momentum continuing this year, giving the Fed the ability to let still-restrictive interest rates slow inflation and watch what government policies are enacted.</p><p class=\"\">\"I remind everybody, the world is always full of uncertainty,\" Daly said. \"In my time at the Fed, I've lived through a financial crisis and a pandemic, and those were extraordinarily uncertain times...Uncertainty is not a paralysis. It just means we have to watch and be careful and thoughtful as we navigate the information we have. So that's how I'm approaching 2025 as a monetary policy maker: We can take our time.\"</p><p class=\"\">The primary sources of uncertainty in 2025 include decisions by President Donald Trump's administration, as shown by the on-again, off-again tariff episode among the U.S., Mexico, and Canada over the weekend and on Monday.</p><p class=\"\">While tariffs can have non-economic goals that are outside the areas central banks assess, she said she doesn't see a significant risk to U.S. growth. She will be evaluating the effect of enacted and potential tariffs by their impact on inflation.</p><p class=\"\">\"They're really not that big by economic damage, there's some economic damage,\" Daly said. \"But as much as I hate them, I can't gin myself to say they're terrible.\"</p><p class=\"\">Immigration policies are another potential area of economic disruption, should the U.S. labor force be meaningfully affected, Daly said. Other factors are potential tax reductions and deregulation. The ultimate impact on the economy will depend on the scope, magnitude, and timing of those policies</p><p class=\"\">\"The way we have to think about it as policy makers is to [focus on the] net effect of all of those, and we don't know what it is yet,\" Daly said. \"If you take preemptive action...you can end up making a policy mistake.\"</p><p class=\"\">The FOMC's next meeting is on March 18-19, when officials will have two more months of inflation and jobs data to consider. Futures are pricing in a roughly 85% chance of a continued pause in interest rates.</p><p class=\"\">Market pricing and the FOMC's median projection both call for a total of a half of a percentage point of interest-rate cuts this year.</p><p class=\"\">\"The Fed is in a good position to wait and see,\" Daly said. \"We will get inflation down...and if it takes more than the rest of this year, we'll continue our work.\"</p><p class=\"\">Write to Nicholas Jasinski at nicholas.jasinski@barrons.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The move brings the Stamford, Conn., company's corporate headcount down to about 300 employees, Lovesac said, and includes layoffs and redistributing jobs elsewhere in the company.</p><p class=\"\">Lovesac, and many of its U.S. competitors, have shifted their manufacturing operations out of China and into other countries in Southeast Asia such as Indonesia and Vietnam in recent years. Trump's latest tariffs could result in higher prices for home goods and weigh on furniture makers' sales as consumers continue to shy away from big-ticket purchases, further delaying the sector's recovery after the pandemic.</p><p class=\"\">When Trump began raising tariffs on China in 2018, Lovesac made 90% of its products in China. The company has since reduced that rate to between 15% to 19%. Lovesac also makes less than 1% of its products in Mexico, another target of Trump's tariff measures.</p><p class=\"\">\"We're not pursuing any drastic cost-cutting measures, but we're just being very prudent and not adding many new costs as we enter these new frontiers,\" Nelson said.</p><p class=\"\">Lovesac said it aims to reduce its manufacturing in China to 10% to 15% by the end of the year and is considering raising prices to counteract the effects of the tariff.</p><p class=\"\">Nelson said he doesn't expect the imminent 10% tariff hike for China-made goods to have a meaningful effect on the company's earnings, however. He said Lovesac's workforce reduction will allow the company to expand into new categories within the next three years.</p><p class=\"\">Lovesac mostly sells sectional sofas and plans to branch out into couches and chairs, Nelson said.</p><p class=\"\">\"That's a big opportunity for us and we believe that these other categories will be seeing recoveries,\" he said.</p><p class=\"\">Lovesac, also known for its knotted bean bags, had about 2,000 employees total in April 2024, according to its latest proxy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p class=\"\">In December, Lovesac posted a drop in third-quarter sales to $149.9 million and guided for lower earnings and sales for fiscal 2025. The company also guided for sales to grow 7% to 12% and earnings per share to at least double in fiscal 2026, without taking into account any potential new tariffs.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Sabela Ojea at sabela.ojea@wsj.com; @sabelaojeaguix</p></span></div>",
