But Ferrari has been sheltered from the turmoil thanks to its limited exposure to China and its ability to maintain margins as it sells to more exclusive customers than ordinary manufacturers.</p><p class=\"\">In China, sports cars are a smaller part of the luxury market than other regions. Ferrari wants to keep sales in the country below 10% of its overall deliveries as it is a lower-margin region due to high taxes.</p><p class=\"\">Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan accounted for only around 8% of the company's global car shipments in 2024.</p><p class=\"\">Analysts also expect Ferrari to weather any trade charges levied on European imports into the U.S., should President Trump follow through with threats to hit the EU with tariffs.</p><p class=\"\">Ferraris are exclusively produced in Italy, so all of its cars for the U.S. market are imports, but analysts at Bernstein say the company is protected by its strong pricing power.</p><p class=\"\">Net profit in the quarter grew to 386 million euros from 294 million euros, ahead of the 335 million euros analysts had forecast.</p><p class=\"\">Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization rose to 643 million euros from 558 million euros, generating a 37.0% margin. Meanwhile, earnings before interest and taxes increased to 468 million euros from 372 million euros, generating a 27.0% margin.</p><p class=\"\">Analysts had forecast Ebitda of 631 million euros and EBIT of 442 million euros.</p><p class=\"\">Ferrari set its full-year 2025 revenue target at more than 7 billion euros, after achieving 2024 revenue of 6.68 billion euros.</p><p class=\"\">The company is targeting 2025 adjusted Ebitda of at least 2.68 billion euros, from 2.56 billion euros in 2024, with a margin of at least 38.3%.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Washington DC, Feb.  04, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — <!-- -->Washington DC - Feb. 4, 2025 - Students For Liberty (SFL) is excited to announce the final lineup of their yearly flagship event, <!-- -->LibertyCon International 2025, taking place on February 7-8 at the Washington DC Downtown Westin. With students active in 111 countries, previous LibertyCon events have been hosted in Africa, Europe, Latin America, and South America. The theme of this year's convention is <em>From Impossible To Inevitable</em>, focusing on the positive achievements in civil rights and economic freedoms happening in the world. </p><p class=\"\">This year will also debut the <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Students For Liberty</strong> partnership with <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">CiVL</strong>, a streaming platform that “inspires humanity to build beyond politics.” The platform allows individuals to gain access to award-winning films, shows, live streams, documentaries, and debates completely free. <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Justin Arman</strong>, founder of CiVL, talked about how CiVL is “thrilled to partner with SFL to collaborate on this mission.” </p><p class=\"\">“So many are over partisanism and the culture war. We believe we’re entering an era of optimism and creativity, which is why we founded CiVL.” Arman continued, “We’re collaborating with remarkable creators on a catalog that inspires humanity to build beyond politics, to choose innovation over coercion, and to embrace human respect in the pursuit of a lasting prosperity.”</p><p class=\"\">CiVL will be streaming the bulk of LibertyCon International main stage presentations live throughout the weekend on the CiVL platform for free, which includes many celebrity guests, political movers and shakers in the liberty sphere, and a heavily promoted immigration debate. </p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Mayor of Knox County, Tennessee, Glenn Jacobs</strong> has been announced as the keynote speaker for LibertyCon International 2025. Mayor Jacobs is currently serving his second term as Mayor of Knox County, Tennessee. Prior to becoming Mayor in 2018, he enjoyed a successful career in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) under the stage name “Kane” that culminated in his induction into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2020. </p><p class=\"\">Elected as a member of the Republican Party, Mayor Jacobs has a long libertarian streak running through him, especially when it comes to civil rights and economic freedom. “I was taught, growing up, that there are two ends of the political spectrum: left and right. But there's so much more than that. For me, it's about liberty versus authoritarianism.” The bookshelf in his office backs this sentiment up, with such titles as “Man, Economy, and State” by Murry Rothbard, “Human Action” by Ludwig von Mises, “More Guns, Less Crime” by John R. Lott Jr., and “End the Fed” by former Congressman Ron Paul. Mayor Jacobs will be delivering his keynote speech during the Students For Liberty awards dinner Saturday evening. </p><p class=\"\">Opening the convention on Friday evening is jazz, R&amp;B and blues musician <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Daryl Davis</strong>, who is not only an international star still touring to this day, but is also an activist who made a name for himself over the decades by converting over 200 klansmen. Through communication and compassion, Davis spent years confronting and converting numerous members of the Klu Klux Klan mostly around his home in and around Maryland. </p><p class=\"\">“If you spend five minutes with your worst enemy - it doesn't have to be about race, it could be about anything... you will find that you both have something in common. As you build upon those commonalities, you're forming a relationship and as you build about that relationship, you're forming a friendship.” Davis’ talk is titled From Hate To Harmony and is expected to be a highlight of the convention. </p><p class=\"\">Appearing on a panel to discuss the entertainment industry and how the individual panelists found their path into the freedom movement is Hollywood actor and producer <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Mark Pellegrino</strong>. Known for playing memorable characters like Lucifer in the series Supernatural, Paul Bennett in Dexter and more recently Virgil Poe in the series American Rust, Pellegrino co-founded the American Capitalist Party, which advocates “for reason, for individual rights, for limited Constitutional government, and for laissez-faire capitalism.” </p><p class=\"\">Appearing alongside Pellegrino on the entertainment panel is professional wrestler and recent TNA world champion <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Nic Nemeth</strong>. Known for over twenty years in WWE under his stage name Dolph Ziggler, Nemeth does podcasting, stand up comedy and is the current TNA World Champion. Nemeth and Pellegrino will share the stage with fellow actor and serial entrepreneur <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Brando Eaton</strong>, known for playing roles in Dexter and American Sniper, and running almost a dozen different business prospects in his hometown Nashville. Rounding out their discussion is TV personality <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Emily Austin</strong>, who made a name for herself interviewing NBA stars on her show Hoop Chat, while also working as an MTV anchor and routinely serving as a Miss Universe judge.</p><p class=\"\">Considered the biggest feature of the conference for many is Immigration Debate: Who Exactly Should We Be Letting In? On Friday night. Hosted by co-founder and CEO of the non-profit Emergent Order Foundation, <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">John Papola</strong>, the immigration debate distinctly tries to draw lines on two very different ideologies with regards to who should be allowed to enter the country and who should be turned away. </p><p class=\"\">Born in Venezuela, economist <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Daniel DiMartino</strong> believes that “America should welcome many more highly skilled immigrants (college educated and young), and effectively restrict illegal and even low-skilled legal immigration; that is, of people who tend to not speak English or receive more government benefits than they pay in taxes.” </p><p class=\"\">George Mason economist <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Bryan Caplan</strong> disagrees with the restrictions, believing that “there are massive economic gains of low-skilled immigration.” He claims “we benefit from drivers, gardeners, and nannies as well as doctors, programmers, and bankers,” and continues by stating that “anyone concerned about immigrants who consume more benefits than they pay in taxes should carefully study the math to see how common this really is, and push for restricting government spending rather than human beings.”</p><p class=\"\">Distinguished Professor Emerita of Economics and of History, and Professor Emerita of English and of Communication, adjunct in classics and philosophy, at the University of Illinois at Chicago, <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Deirdre McCloskey</strong> will be returning again with her wit and wisdom with a discussion she calls “Equality of Permission.” </p><p class=\"\">Co-founder and former CEO of Whole Foods Market, <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">John Mackey</strong>, will also join us on the main stage to talk about his life as an entrepreneur and to promote his new book titled The Whole Truth: Adventures of Love, Life, and Capitalism. He will also be taking part in the book author signing station set up throughout the weekend. </p><p class=\"\">Many notable speakers from multiple groups and diverse backgrounds across the globe will also be taking part in the conference throughout the weekend.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb.  04, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Double Deuce Exploration Corp. (CSE-DD) Double Deuce Exploration Corp. (the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has signed a Definitive Option Agreement (the “Agreement”) from a single private owner (The “Vendor”) to acquire a 100% undivided interest in the Lac Big-Rush Property (the “Property”), located in a highly prospective area within the Chibougamau Mining Camp of Quebec. This prolific camp has experienced a revival of interest over the last few years due to a number of companies focused on advancing noteworthy projects in the resource development stage. For example, Iamgold Corporation’s Nelligan project is host to 73.5 million tonnes at 0.84 gram per tonne (“g/t”) totalling 2.0 Moz in the indicated resource category and 129.5 millions tonnes at 0.87 g/t totalling 3.6 Moz in the inferred resources category (Iamgold press release dated February 23, 2023).</p><p class=\"\">The property is composed of 40 claim units covering approximately 2,214 hectares and is located on the Eeyou-Istchee Baie-James territory. The Property is approximately 32 kilometers from the town of Chibougamau, accessible year round via highway 113 and then by well-travelled gravel roads. A 100% undivided interest in the property can be acquired by the Company in consideration of a total $30,000 cash payment, incurring $300,000 in exploration expenditures and issuing 600,000 shares of the Company within the next three years.</p><p class=\"\">Micheal Dake, Chief Executive Officer of Double Deuce, stated: “We are pleased to have acquired the Lac Big-Rush Property, located in this prolific and highly-prospective mining camp in Quebec, a Tier-1 mining jurisdiction. We believe this asset has tremendous discovery potential, seeing as it has noteworthy historical drill hole data, yet hasn’t had any exploration work done to it since the early 1980’s. We look forward to compiling the historical data and the planning of a preliminary exploration campaign in the coming months.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">THE TRANSACTION</strong></p><p class=\"\">Pursuant to the Option Agreement between the private Vendor and the Company, the Company may acquire 100% interest in the Property and will have the exclusive rights to explore and develop the Property over the next three (3) years in consideration of:</p><p class=\"\">(i)      Total cash payments of $30,000 to the Vendor as follow:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">$5,000 paid upon the signature of the Letter of Intent;</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">$5,000 paid upon the signature of the formal Option Agreement (The “Agreement”);</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">$10,000 payable on the First anniversary date of the Agreement;</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">$10,000 payable upon the receipt of a Positive Preliminary Economic Assessment.</li></ul><p class=\"\">(ii)      Total issuance of 600,000 common shares of the Company on or before the following dates:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">400,000 common shares upon signature of the formal Option Agreement;</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">100,000 common shares on the first anniversary date of the Agreement;</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">100,000 common shares upon the receipt of a Positive Preliminary Economic Assessment;</li></ul><p class=\"\">At the end of this period, the Company will have acquired 100% interest in the Property.</p><p class=\"\">The Vendor will retain a 2% Net Smelter Royalty (NSR) from the proceeds of any commercial production. The Company will have the right to purchase up to 1% of the remaining NSR for the sum of $1,000,000 at any time, by providing the Vendor written notice to that effect. The Vendor will have a 2 km area of interest surrounding the Property. The Transaction is subject to the CSE approval.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p><p class=\"\">The Lac Big-Rush property is part of the Chibougamau Mining Camp with a total metal endowment of 1.6 billion pounds copper lbs Cu and 3.2 Moz gold mined since the 1950’s, mostly from underground mines (1). The property location, along the east-west Faribault and Croteau inverse faults and shears, is included in a gold bearing area, neighboring to the east of the Northern Superior Croteau Project. The geology property is characterised by basalt, amphibolite interlayered with gabbro sills of the Bruneau Formation.</p><p class=\"\">The Croteau mineralized system hosts an inferred near surface resources of 640 000 oz at 1.73 g/t hosted in iron carbonate altered shear system with quartz veining which known limit is about 300 meters from the Lac Big-Rush property to the west (2).</p><p class=\"\">The Lac Big-Rush Property has had limited exploration work performed from the early 1950’s until the early 1980’s, when Noranda drilled approximately 10 diamond drill holes (“DDH”). According to public records, about 20 DDH were drilled on the property since early 1950’s and before 1986. Two historical gold showings, Tadd and Croteau West, are listed in the Province Sigeom database.</p><p class=\"\">The Tadd showing (UTMnad83Z18 527390E, 5536868N) is interpreted as a 2.3 meters wide mineralized quartz vein on average followed over 50 meters of strike length. The mineralized structure has an east-west orientation and is strongly dipping. Two drilled results returned 7.2 and 5.3 grams per tons over 0.7 metres from DDH BG 84-4 (Sigeom). Gold values are hosted in gabbro affected by iron carbonate pervasive alteration (Sigeom).</p><p class=\"\">The Croteau showing (UTMnad83Z18 528680E, 5536628N) located about 2.6km east of the Tadd showing is an outcropping mineralized occurrence. A channel sample returned 3 g/t Au over 1.5 meters during Cree Mineral Exploration Board 2018 prospecting program (assessment report GM-71214).</p><p class=\"\">The Company will undertake a detailed review of historical works before mobilizing resources on the ground.</p><p class=\"\">Martin Demers P.
