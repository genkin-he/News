            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Krystal Hur</p><p class=\"\">Wall Street's AI trade soured last week, but investors are still firmly clutching the playbooks that worked so well over the past two years.</p><p class=\"\">They are positioning for big technology shares to keep climbing by scooping up options contracts that would pay out if stocks such as Apple and Amazon.com race higher in the next few weeks.</p><p class=\"\">Tech stocks were throttled by the emergence of Chinese upstart DeepSeek, whose artificial-intelligence platform appears up to snuff with Silicon Valley models, despite being developed at a fraction of the cost. The shares took another hit Monday after President Trump brandished tariff threats against China, Canada and Mexico.</p><p class=\"\">Those incidents flustered traders, who for two years faithfully drove up big tech stocks, betting that cutting-edge U.S. chips put them at the forefront of the AI revolution. Shares of Nvidia, the graphics-chip maker at the heart of the frenzy, declined 17% in a single session last week, losing almost $600 billion in market value.</p><p class=\"\">Yet after both incidents, many of the big tech stocks stormed back. The Nasdaq Composite is off 2.6% from its Dec. 16 all-time high and clinging to a 1.8% advance for 2025.</p><p class=\"\">\"It seems like you can't escape this tech trade right now,\" said Brad Roth, chief investment officer of Pennsylvania-based Thor Financial Technologies.</p><p class=\"\">A slate of generally encouraging earnings results and commentary from executives reassured investors that the spending spigots are still wide open. Companies including Meta Platforms and Microsoft said the emergence of DeepSeek wouldn't deter them from ambitious investments.</p><p class=\"\">Four of the big tech stocks in the Magnificent Seven — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Meta — have climbed since Jan. 24, before DeepSeek spooked investors. Meta is the bright spot: Its shares have hit repeated all-time highs and are in the midst of a 12-session winning streak, their longest on record.</p><p class=\"\">Nvidia, on the other hand, has taken the hardest hit. The graphic-chip maker's stock is down 17% over the past seven sessions. Excluding Nvidia, the Magnificent Seven have gained more than $160 billion in market value over that period, according to Dow Jones Market Data. (Shares of Microsoft and Tesla have declined as well.)</p><p class=\"\">In coming days, investors will parse earnings reports from the likes of Amazon, Take-Two Interactive Software and ON Semiconductor for insights into how companies will weather sweeping policy changes under Trump. Friday's monthly jobs report will give investors their next chance to gauge the economy's strength.</p><p class=\"\">Traders have pounced on options tied to the highflying tech stocks. More than $40 billion in options contracts tied to the Magnificent Seven changed hands last week, the biggest weekly tally so far this year, according to Cboe Global Markets data. More than $26 billion was tied to call options that offer the right to buy a stock, at a set price, by a certain date.</p><p class=\"\">Call option activity tied to Meta Platforms reached its highest level since April 2024, according to Cboe, while activity tied to Microsoft hit levels not seen since July 2023.</p><p class=\"\">In recent days, some of the most actively traded Apple contracts have been calls tied to shares jumping to $245 and $250, Cboe data show. They closed Tuesday at $232.80. For Amazon, traders snapped up bets that the stock would climb to $255 and $260, up from Tuesday's close of $242.06.</p><p class=\"\">One factor behind the quick bounceback in tech stocks? Some investors are already skeptical about DeepSeek's capabilities and whether the company poses a threat to the AI trade. OpenAI said it is probing whether the company trained its chatbot using OpenAI's models, casting doubt on just how impressive DeepSeek's technology is.</p><p class=\"\">Others point out that some U.S. companies such as Meta and Apple could benefit from a cheaper large language model, or LLM, the technology underlying chatbots like ChatGPT. Some executives have cheered having broader access to AI models.</p><p class=\"\">Options activity was bullish ahead of Alphabet's earnings report Tuesday afternoon, but the company reported a slowdown in sales growth for its most recent quarter, disappointing investors.</p><p class=\"\">Rhett Zeid, a full-time trader in New Jersey, added to his pile of Tesla calls expiring in June during the tech rout last week. The 26-year-old has been a staunch Tesla bull since the pandemic, when a launch of Elon Musk-owned SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket convinced him of the chief executive's business acumen.</p><p class=\"\">He plans to start gradually selling those calls when the stock reaches $455, a roughly 16% increase from Tuesday's close. Zeid says the emergence of DeepSeek hasn't changed his belief that the EV maker will eventually produce the fully driverless robotaxis that Musk has teased for years, making Tesla's stock the AI play \"of the century.\"</p><p class=\"\">\"I mean, it\"'s pretty much a sealed deal,\" said Zeid. \"2025 and beyond should be pretty awesome.\"</p><p class=\"\">Some analysts, though, say they expect more volatility ahead.</p><p class=\"\">One longstanding point of concern is the staggering valuations of some of the stocks. The S&amp;P 500's information-technology sector, which houses Nvidia and Apple, was recently trading at roughly 27 times its expected earnings over the next 12 months. The communication-services sector, which includes Meta and Alphabet, trades at 21 times. The broader S&amp;P 500's multiple is 22.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Krystal Hur at krystal.hur@wsj.com</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Mengqi Sun</p><p class=\"\">Many in the cryptocurrency industry are optimistic that a new task force formed by the U.S. securities regulator will provide a road map for growth in the industry that contrasts with the regulation-by-enforcement approach under the Biden administration.</p><p class=\"\">The Securities and Exchange Commission, under acting Chairman Mark Uyeda, said on Jan. 21 it is launching a task force \"dedicated to developing a comprehensive and clear regulatory framework for crypto assets.\" Republican SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, known among crypto enthusiasts as \"CryptoMom,\" is leading the task force. The regulator announced a few more adviser appointments to the task force on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"\">The formation of the task force, announced a day after President Trump's inauguration, was welcomed by the virtual currency industry, which has been eagerly awaiting moves by Trump to bring it greater legitimacy. Crypto policy advisers are already putting out proposals for what the SEC should first tackle under its existing jurisdiction and are hoping the regulator will act right away without waiting for Congress to pass legislation or confirm Trump's nominee for SEC chairman, Paul Atkins.</p><p class=\"\">The SEC has said the task force would set clear regulatory lines under its current jurisdiction provided by Congress, in addition to imposing enforcement actions. It would also provide paths for crypto companies to register with regulators and frameworks for what industry players would need to disclose to the government. The task force, consisting of agency staff, will also hold roundtables and solicit public input via an agency email address.</p><p class=\"\">\"There are a lot of tools that the SEC has and just hasn't been exercised in the past; this is a process that will start this conversation,\" said Kristin Smith, chief executive of crypto-advocacy group Blockchain Association.</p><p class=\"\">First steps</p><p class=\"\">Smith said the agency could do several things right away that could help companies better understand the rules of the road. These include issuing more interpretive guidance on various issues, such as when staking, a method by which some crypto networks process and validate a transaction, should be considered a security by regulators. In staking, crypto investors can essentially pledge their computing power and crypto holdings to a network for a specified period in exchange for a reward.</p><p class=\"\">The industry could also benefit from new rule-setting with comment periods allowing the public to weigh in, she said. Also, companies could be encouraged to request so-called no-action letters to the SEC in which they can ask the agency's staff to address whether a product or service would violate securities law.</p><p class=\"\">The crypto industry has criticized the approach taken by the SEC over the past four years under former Chair Gary Gensler, in which the regulator relied primarily on enforcement actions to regulate crypto retroactively and adopted legal interpretations along the way, rather than proposing rules.</p><p class=\"\">\"The result has been confusion about what is legal, which creates an environment hostile to innovation and conducive to fraud. The SEC can do better,\" the agency said in the statement announcing the task force.</p><p class=\"\">Industry response</p><p class=\"\">Some crypto companies are answering the agency's call for ideas.</p><p class=\"\">A16z Crypto, venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz's crypto arm, in a blog post proposed changes that the firm says the SEC can adopt \"immediately and easily\" to make crypto more accessible while providing investor protections. One thing the regulator could do, the firm suggests, is to enable traditional broker-dealers to transact in the crypto space. The firm's chief compliance officer, a co-author of the blog post, said current regulations restrict broker-dealers from engaging with crypto because they require brokers to obtain separate approvals and impose more rules on those looking to provide custody for crypto assets.</p><p class=\"\">A16z also said the SEC should develop tailored requirements for broker-dealers to register to deal in crypto assets and establish oversight mechanisms to ensure compliance with anti-money-laundering rules. The SEC can also work with industry groups, such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, to issue joint guidance on the operational risks related to crypto, the firm said.</p><p class=\"\">J.W. Verret, a securities law and forensic accounting professor at George Mason University who has served on the SEC investor advisory committee, hopes the SEC can also issue guidance on defining what qualifies as a security.</p><p class=\"\">He added that the regulator could also adopt a private offering exemption, similar to an existing exemption used often by venture-capital firms investing in Silicon Valley startups. Verret said that could be a way to implement Peirce's \"safe harbor\" idea of giving a grace period from certain securities law requirements to decentralized network developers. He said the proposed exemption would allow investors to back decentralized crypto projects, or those without a central company running the project.</p><p class=\"\">Verret is optimistic that the SEC is listening to the crypto community, even as debate over how to regulate the industry continues.</p><p class=\"\">\"The ethos of crypto is to embrace debate — that is the strength of crypto, and having these open forums at the SEC would be a great thing. It would be helpful to the SEC and to the community,\" he said.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Mengqi Sun at mengqi.sun@wsj.com</p></span></div>",

LVMH founder Bernard Arnault said on the company's latest earnings call that customers feel \"ripped off\" after luxury brands raised prices aggressively in recent years.</p><p class=\"\">It is also not a great time to ask American consumers for more money, as demand is fragile. After 10 consecutive quarters of shrinking, U.S. luxury spending showed signs of improvement at the end of last year, based on credit-card data from Bank of America. Brands hope that improving demand from U.S. shoppers will eventually offset weak sales to Chinese consumers, and won't want to do anything that might upset the recovery.</p><p class=\"\">Moving some manufacturing stateside would allow brands to avoid tariffs altogether. Luxury companies might even save money in the long term — energy is much cheaper in the U.S. than in Europe and subsidies are available in some states to build factories that provide local jobs.</p><p class=\"\">Luxury brands already do plenty of outsourcing, but it tends to happen nearby. According to consulting firm Bain, around 55% of global luxury goods are produced in Italy, mainly by independent factories that take on work for big brands.</p><p class=\"\">The \"Made in Italy\" or \"Made in France\" labels on expensive handbags and clothing do increase their appeal to some consumers. And certain luxury goods can't be manufactured elsewhere as they are tied to a specific region. Champagne production must happen in northeast France, Swiss watch manufacturing in Switzerland.</p><p class=\"\">But mass-market luxury brands such as Gucci or Prada are a bit more footloose. Moncler, the maker of $3,000 Puffer jackets, manufactures in low-cost Romania. This hasn't dented its appeal, says Bernstein luxury analyst Luca Solca. Once a luxury brand operates the factory itself and keeps standards high, its customers are less likely to react badly to production in a new country.</p><p class=\"\">Manufacturing outside Europe hasn't harmed LVMH-owned Louis Vuitton either. The brand already has three large factories in America that produce handbags for the local market. These purses carry a \"made in U.S.A. of imported materials\" label and shoppers don't seem to mind. Louis Vuitton ranked as Americans' favorite luxury brand in the latest UBS consumer survey.</p><p class=\"\">LVMH's Arnault said the company might move even more production to the U.S. in the future. Tax increases in France, coupled with the threat of tariffs, make producing in America more appealing. It is also good business considering LVMH makes a quarter of its sales in the U.S. these days.</p><p class=\"\">Certain labels are prized by consumers precisely because their goods are handmade in Europe — that means Hermès probably won't be relocating to Texas any time soon. But for brands a little lower in the luxury hierarchy, American factories could turn out to be a smart defense in a more protectionist global economy.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Carol Ryan at carol.ryan@wsj.com</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Feb.  05, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Aerospike, Inc. (“Aerospike”), today unveiled Database 8, a major upgrade of its flagship multi-model distributed database. Version 8 adds distributed ACID transactions to support large-scale online transaction processing (OLTP) applications. Building on its enterprise-grade operations and best-in-class efficiency, Aerospike 8 is the first real-time distributed database to guarantee strict serializability of ACID transactions with industry-leading performance and efficiency at a fraction of the cost of other systems.</p><p class=\"\">For industries and applications like banking, e-commerce, inventory management, healthcare, order processing and telecom — or any digital business requiring mission-critical transactional workloads — reliable, consistent, and scalable distributed OLTP systems are non-negotiable. Yet, legacy databases have struggled to deliver.</p><p class=\"\">For nearly a decade, Aerospike has set the standard in strong consistency for single-record requests, achieving millions of transactions per second (TPS) with sub-millisecond latency, whether at gigabytes or petabytes of data. Aerospike Database 8 expands data consistency guarantees with strict serializability (the highest-level guarantee) to distributed multi-object transactions with low latency, even while serving massive concurrent connections.</p><p class=\"\">Now, businesses can achieve the most stringent level of guarantees, eliminating inconsistencies that can lead to costly errors while benefitting from real-time performance. Since Aerospike requires a fraction of the hardware resources of other databases, enterprises benefit from both substantial operational cost savings and the opportunity to embrace new environmental sustainability goals.</p><p class=\"\">“Aerospike has always been a transaction powerhouse, with customers scaling to hundreds of millions of TPS on massive amounts of data,” said Subbu Iyer, CEO of Aerospike. “With 8.0, Aerospike has solved one of the most challenging problems in distributed systems so that enterprises can break free from the decades-old trade-off between transactional consistency and high performance — and scale mission-critical applications without compromise.”</p><p class=\"\">Building Powerful, Scalable OLTP Applications Has Never Been Easier</p><p class=\"\">Aerospike’s distributed transaction support simplifies OLTP development by moving the burden of building and maintaining transaction management logic from the application to the database. Developers get Aerospike's intuitive transaction APIs to speed and simplify development. Spring developers can immediately write to the same Spring Data transaction APIs they are used to, and Java developers can code to the standard Spring Framework transaction management APIs without any knowledge of Aerospike internal processes.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">The Aerospike Multi-model Database Advantage</strong></p><p class=\"\">Aerospike’s multi-model database engine (supporting document, key-value, graph, and vector data types) also significantly reduces development and operational complexity. Developers can choose the best data model for each specific use case, reducing overhead and enhancing agility.</p><p class=\"\">The Aerospike multi-model database can be deployed on premises and on all major public clouds, giving developers and operators the flexibility needed to deploy real-time applications wherever and however they like, including in hybrid environments.</p><p class=\"\">Try Aerospike Database 8.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Brian Swint</p><p class=\"\">Stocks have been dealt two major shocks in the past two weeks — the DeepSeek threat and President Donald Trump's tariffs saga. And yet they've powered on, still trading close to record highs.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, none of the issues that have put markets on edge have gone away. But the quick recovery from what could be serious scares shows that traders are an optimistic bunch--and it's hopefully a good sign for the rally that is now into its third year.</p><p class=\"\">After a 0.7% rally Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 closed just 1.3% off its record high set last month. The Nasdaq jumped 2.4% yesterday to finish within 3% of its high set in December. The market's resilience looks likely to be tested Wednesday, though, as stock futures fell ahead of the open after earnings from Alphabet and Advanced Micro Devices.</p><p class=\"\">Last week, the news that Chinese startup DeepSeek was able to develop artificial intelligence models — apparently at a fraction of the price of U.S. counterparts — sent a jolt through the technology sector, but it quickly recovered. This week, President Donald Trump's announcement of tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China, sent shockwaves through the market, at least until some of them were delayed.</p><p class=\"\">There are plenty of other bad things to pay attention to, if you want to look more closely. Stocks, especially Big Tech, are trading on historically high multiples. The Federal Reserve, spooked by sticky inflation, may not be able to lower interest rates much more. And Trump continues to overwhelm anyone trying to keep up with a whirlwind of new initiatives, the latest being his proposal to take over Gaza.</p><p class=\"\">But it's also worth making a list of the good things. Tariffs still appear, on balance, to be more of a negotiating tactic than a serious threat--even tension with China may simmer down as leaders put phone calls in their diaries. Executives from the biggest tech companies have all shrugged off the threat from DeepSeek. Their comments range from Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai welcoming the competition, to Microsoft's Satya Nadella saying it will stoke demand for AI, to Palantir arguing that a lower AI cost structure will help business.</p><p class=\"\">The bond market, often seen as the wiser older sibling to stocks, has remained calm these past two weeks. Yields are pushing further away from peaks seen last month--the 10-year yield was below 4.5% early Tuesday, down from as high as 4.8% in January. That could be seen as both a sign of composure and a positive indicator for shares, which are valued relative to bonds.</p><p class=\"\">Of course things may still go south. In the early 2000s, the dot com bubble took two slow, long years to burst before it could recover. And keep in mind that traders tend to overreact, both on the way up and the way down. But for now, the market looks like it's staying on its feet.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Organized by the Royal Ocean Racing Club (RORC), the regatta will take place from July 17 to August 1, 2025, in Cowes, on the Isle of Wight. Founded in 1957 and often referred to as the “Unofficial World Cup of Offshore Sailing”, the Admiral’s Cup is making its return after more than twenty years of absence, with the last edition held in 2003. The competition brings together the world’s top sailors for a series of coastal and offshore races, including the Rolex Fastnet Race.</p><p class=\"\">The initiative to participate in the Admiral’s Cup was spearheaded by Peter Harrison, a YCM member and owner of the Jolt boats, with the full support of Pierre Casiraghi, Vice President of the Club and founder of Team Malizia. \"Peter is a great sailor with an outstanding team,\" said Casiraghi. \"When he proposed that we take part in the Admiral’s Cup with the Jolt boats, I immediately accepted this incredible challenge.\" The Monegasque team will field two top-tier boats: the TP52 Jolt 3, skippered by Peter Harrison in the IRC Big Boat class, and the Carkeek 40 Jolt 6, helmed by Pierre Casiraghi. \"We have a solid training program, high-performance boats, and a determined team,\" Casiraghi added. \"Consistency will be key: two poor races can make everything more complicated. We must stay focused and approach each day as a new challenge.\"</p><p class=\"\">This initiative is part of the Yacht Club de Monaco’s broader sporting strategy, inspired by the vision of its President, HSH. Prince Albert II, with the goal of promoting high-level sailing and inspiring younger generations. \"We have followed Boris Herrmann’s journey in the Vendée Globe with pride, admiring his commitment and courage,\" declared the Sovereign Prince. \"This new project embodies our sporting vision. These challenges inspire us and ignite new passions.\"</p><p class=\"\">To take on this new challenge, the Monegasque crew will rely on the expertise of world-class sailors, including Boris Herrmann and Will Harris from Team Malizia, as well as Cole Brauer, the first American woman to complete a solo, non-stop circumnavigation in 130 days, and runner-up in the 2024 Global Solo Challenge. Peter Harrison shares this enthusiasm: \"The Yacht Club de Monaco is a major force in world sailing. Competing in the Admiral’s Cup is a unique opportunity to showcase our experience and passion.\"</p><p class=\"\">The Admiral’s Cup 2025 will bring together over 15 teams representing prestigious yacht clubs, including the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron, the Yacht Club Costa Smeralda, and the New York Yacht Club, a three-time winner of the event. Australia, represented by the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia, is the defending champion, having won the last edition in 2003. The competition will feature a mix of technical inshore races and demanding offshore challenges, where consistency and the overall performance of the crew will be decisive.</p><p class=\"\">By participating in this event, the Yacht Club de Monaco reaffirms its ambition to guide its members toward excellence and to strengthen its influence on the international stage. A great challenge that the Monegasque team is ready to take on with determination and passion.</p><p class=\"\"><em>For more information:</em></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><em>Press Office LaPresse </em></strong><em>- </em><em>ufficio.stampa@lapresse.it</em></p><p class=\"\">A photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/8cf1b899-3c1d-4789-9c8d-c4219a22e967</p></span></div>",
