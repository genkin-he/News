            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">(The Insurer) - The hotly anticipated launch of the rated carrier from industry veteran Brian Duperreault’s start-up Mereo has now been slated for 1.4, having secured ~$650mn in capital with the ambition of growing the pool to $1bn by the end of the year, The Insurer understands.</p><p class=\"\">This will mark Bermuda’s first meaningful reinsurance launch since Canopius Re was granted its Class 4 licence among a number of start-ups that began life during the pandemic. </p><p class=\"\">Mereo Insurance, the main balance sheet vehicle, was approved in December by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) as a Class 3B insurer. The vehicle is expected to secure an A- AM Best rating after receiving a preliminary A- financial strength assessment in February last year.</p><p class=\"\">It will underwrite across a broad spectrum of property, casualty and specialty classes and is looking to participate both on a proportional and non-proportional basis.</p><p class=\"\">The start-up's ILS fund – Mereo ILS Opportunities Limited – has also been approved by the BMA, with the Neil Strong-led vehicle understood to have already been active at 1 January after a successful initial fundraising.</p><p class=\"\">It has been a long journey for executive chairman Duperreault and his senior management team – led by London market stalwart David Croom-Johnson as CEO and CUO of Mereo Insurance – to get to the point of bringing a rated reinsurance start-up to the market.</p><p class=\"\">After a number of start-ups entered the market in 2020 and 2021, fundraising efforts for new balance sheet vehicles have proved challenging – despite some of the best reinsurance underwriting conditions in over a decade amid the hard market that came in at the start of 2023, at least in property cat.</p><p class=\"\">Instead, investors seeking underwriting risk have preferred the ILS market or to support existing balance sheets either through equity or by backing sidecar-style vehicles. </p><p class=\"\">As a result, even an industry heavyweight such as Duperreault – the former AIG, Marsh McLennan and Ace CEO – has faced a number of investor headwinds since the project's genesis in 2023.</p><p class=\"\">After initial suggestions of a 2024 launch, Mereo was most recently slated to begin underwriting at the start of 2025, but it was confirmed at the end of last year that it would not be taking part in 1 January reinsurance renewals via its rated balance sheet. </p><p class=\"\">Although it had received a preliminary A- financial strength assessment from AM Best in February last year, it was understood that while Mereoʼs capital was in place for 1.1, the final timing of rating approvals was too late to participate in January renewals.</p><p class=\"\">Mereo has reportedly secured support from private equity firm Susquehanna as a major investor. It has been reported there are six key investors made up of a mix of private equity and trade capital. </p><p class=\"\">However, determined not to miss out on the underwriting opportunity, it has been underwriting collateralised deals through its ILS fund, successfully deploying up to $250mn in capacity with “competitive” terms, according to sources.</p><p class=\"\">Mereo has been contacted for comment.</p><p class=\"\">Broad appetite</p><p class=\"\">According to its website, Mereo will have an appetite in its property book to support regional, nationwide and global carriers, with a focus on cat excess of loss business.</p><p class=\"\">It is expected to build a book that is 70 percent US and 30 percent international with a mix of wind, earthquake, wildfire, severe convective storm and flood exposures. </p><p class=\"\">Outside the US, targeted regions will include Europe, Canada, the Caribbean, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.</p><p class=\"\">In addition to cat, Mereo will look to write classes of property business including political violence, terror, nuclear, industry loss warranties and parametrics.</p><p class=\"\">Its specialty book is expected to cover a “broad” mix of classes including marine, energy, aviation, space, political risks, accident and health, crop and contingency, writing on a proportional and non-proportional basis, with a “modest” appetite for retro.</p><p class=\"\">Target clients are set to include global insurers, P&amp;C-focused carriers, Lloyd’s syndicates and MGAs.</p><p class=\"\">Meanwhile, in casualty, Mereo will look to write a “broad” mix of general and excess liability, professional indemnity, E&amp;O, D&amp;O and cyber, across target industries including marine, energy, transportation, financial lines, mid-market general liability and cyber.</p><p class=\"\">It will aim to access business through quota shares of “proven carriers with impressive track records”, according to its website.</p><p class=\"\">Seasoned management team</p><p class=\"\">In addition to former Aegis London CEO Croom-Johnson, members of the leadership team include ex-Hamilton CFO Jonathan Reiss, who holds the same role at Mereo Advisors and Mereo Insurance. JLT veteran Derek Walsh is chief legal counsel and COO of both entities, while former Fidelis executive Richard Holden serves as deputy CUO of Mereo Insurance and CUO of Mereo ILS.</p><p class=\"\">According to the start-up’s website, Lawrence Minicone is CEO of Mereo Advisors and CIO of Mereo Insurance, and Federico Waisman is chief analytics and risk officer for Mereo Insurance.</p><p class=\"\">Former IQUW, Securis and Execution Noble executive Strong is president of Mereo Advisors and Mereo Insurance and CEO of Mereo ILS.</p><p class=\"\">Duperreault is chairman of Mereo Advisors and Mereo Insurance. </p><p class=\"\">A 1 April launch for Mereo Insurance will put it in the mix during a renewal season that is heavily dominated by Australasia, including the key Japanese renewal, but which also includes a meaningful number of US deals.</p><p class=\"\">The next major renewal date is the US wind-heavy 1 June and 1 July renewals, led by Florida and the Southeast.</p><p class=\"\">The belated arrival of Mereo’s balance sheet vehicle will not represent the only reinsurance launch of note this year.</p><p class=\"\">In parallel, Oak Reinsurance – led by former RenaissanceRe European CUO Cathal Carr – is gearing up to make its mark. </p><p class=\"\">Based in London and underwriting through Lloyd's Syndicate 2843, Oak Re received approval to begin underwriting from 1 January 2025. With projected gross written premiums of $300mn for its inaugural year, Oak Re is backed by prominent capital providers, including Bain Capital and Hampden Agencies.</p></span></div>",

That's an acceleration of 50 basis points from the prior quarter and driven by a healthy spending environment and exposure in specific verticals, Miller says. PayPal made branded checkout its number one priority in 2024, with a big focus on improving the customer experience, according to CEO Alex Chriss. So far, the company feels good about the desktop experience for branded checkout, but sees \"gaps\" in the mobile experience, Chriss tells analysts.

About one in five surveyed companies currently uses generative AI in M&amp;A processes, and more than half expect to integrate it into their dealmaking by 2027, according to the report. Late followers to adopt AI will be outbid for good deals and find themselves staying too long in the process for bad deals, Bain &amp; Company says.

The French advertising group ended the year with strong momentum in the fourth quarter, when organic net revenue growth of 6.3% beat expectations. \"[Publicis] is targeting 4%-5% of organic growth in net revenue for 2025, similar to its guidance for 2024. However, we still anticipate upside potential given its history of being conservative in terms of providing future projections,\" the analyst says. Shares in Publicis rise 1.6%.

CEO Juan Luciano said on a call with investors that the company has identified about $2 billion worth of opportunities. The company is facing pressure from low crop prices and falling profit margins in its oilseed processing business. \"We will execute on this over time,\" Luciano said.

Research firm DesRosiers Automotive Consultants says its data indicate vehicle sales in January rose 3.1% from the same year-ago month, and in terms of volumes matching the best January ever recorded, back in 2018. On a seasonally-adjusted basis, light-vehicle sales came at a \"strapping\" 2.15 million, DesRosiers says. The firm adds it's difficult to put January's performance in context, given Trump's tariff threat. As a result, DesRosiers says it's hard to discern whether strong sales were the result of fears over sharply higher car prices, or a sign of solid domestic demand.

The Italian lender issued a higher-than-expected buyback of 2 billion euros and raised its 2025 net income target to well above 9 billion euros on the back of expected revenue growth and declining costs, the analysts say. \"Overall, fee trends are encouraging and the slight step-up in buyback amounts welcome,\" they say.

CPKC has 41% of its revenue tied to cross-border trade, according to RBC. Sustained tariffs, the analysts say, over a longer period of time could derail its growth plans. \"Moreover, we see many of the company's Investor Day growth targets as dependent on cross-border trade and therefore flag risk to long-term consensus EPS growth estimates should tariffs at current levels be sustained,\" the analysts say.

While some companies continued M&amp;A during this time--navigating unfavorable market realities to deliver inorganic growth--many didn't have this option, the report says. Foundational shifts in technology, sector profit pools, and the broader global economy demanded a strategic response, the management-consulting firm says. \"We expect that the two biggest inhibitors to deals in 2024--namely, interest rates and regulatory challenges--will ease in 2025,\" it adds.

The Denver home builder adds that it's continuing to work with its suppliers but stressed that things remain fluid. \"Typically suppliers will keep a number of months of supply on hand. So if this is just a short-term negotiating tactic, the new home builders may not even feel it,\" says Francescon. While the U.S. paused plans for 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for one month, a 10% levy on imports from China went into effect today.

As we drew a close to the Year of Dragon, our CEO, Mr. Chan Chun Sing, Jeffrey would like to report to you our numerous key achievements in 2024 and share his visions for the year ahead.</p><p class=\"\">“2024 was a remarkable year for Click.” said Jeffrey, founder and CEO of Click. “Not only did we accomplish the historical public listing by raising US$5.6 million on Nasdaq, we also achieved countless breakthroughs in our business.”</p><p class=\"\">“We experienced significant growth across all segments. As for the seniors nursing solution services, we achieved a record of over 170,000 service hours in calendar year 2024, expecting a growth of 60% as compared to that of 2023. In particular, we project our logistic solution services would record a spectacular growth of 90%. To further extend our coverage, in December 2024, we entered a cooperation agreement with Care U Professional Nursing Service Limited, one of the leading nursing service providers in Hong Kong, in order to tap into the prominent government-sponsored CCSV scheme aiming to provide community care services to senior citizens in Hong Kong.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Key 2024 Achievements</strong></p><p class=\"\">- Strong growth in revenue – projected 40% surge in overall revenue in calendar year 2024 compared to that of 2023.

Therefore, we continue to expect high demand of human resources outsourcing services in the market. Meanwhile, as aging population becomes a global phenomenon, we will continue to invest big in the seniors nursing solution sector. We will expand our collaboration with business partners and may consider M&amp;A options when opportunities arise.”</p><p class=\"\">“Furthermore, embracing technology has always been a key to our success. Our CTO, Nixon Chau, former GM of SenseTime Group, a leading AI software company, will lead our team to expand into the smart home solutions market for seniors in Hong Kong. Needless to say, we will continue to invest in expanding our talent pool which has been the bedrock to our business, and will extend services to cover property management, food and beverages, and retailing, sectors all currently facing labour shortages in Hong Kong. We are currently the only Nasdaq-listed company focusing on seniors nursing HR solution in Hong Kong and will continue to sustain strong growth by providing a convenient platform to connect our talents with our clients’ HR shortfall.”</p><p class=\"\">“Looking ahead, I remain fully confident in all our business developments and I hope you feel the same.

Stock index futures rallied in overnight trade after President Trump late Monday agreed to delay 25% tariffs on Canada for a month. Stocks extended their gains today as chip stocks rallied.</p><p class=\"\">However, stock gains are limited after the US imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese goods. China retaliated immediately and announced 15% tariffs on US coal and liquified natural gas and 10% levies on US oil and agriculture equipment. China also declared export control on tungsten-related materials, and the State Administration for Market Regulation said it would launch a probe into Google regarding anti-trust law breaches. The Chinese tariffs are set to take effect on February 10, potentially leaving room for negotiation.</p><p class=\"\">Stocks remained higher despite today's weaker-than-expected US economic reports. The Dec JOLTS job openings fell -556,000 to 7.6 million, showing a weaker labor market than expectations of 8.0 million. Also, Dec factory orders fell -0.9% m/m, weaker than expectations of -0.8% m/m and the biggest decline in 6 months.</p><p class=\"\">Hawkish comments Monday evening from Chicago Fed President Goolsbee were bearish for stocks and bonds when he said, \"The Fed has got to be a little more careful and more prudent of how fast interest rates can come down because there are risks that inflation is about to start kicking back up again.\"</p><p class=\"\">Corporate earnings results today are mixed. Palantir Technologies is up more than +25% after reporting better-than-expected Q4 revenue and forecasting full-year revenue above consensus. Also, Cummins is up more than +4% after reporting stronger-than-expected Q4 net sales. On the negative side, Estee Lauder is down more than -18% after forecasting Q3 organic net sales below consensus. Also, Merck is down more than -11% after projecting weaker-than-expected full-year total sales. </p><p class=\"\">Earnings season is in full swing as companies report Q4 earnings results. Megacap technology companies Alphabet and Advanced Micro Devices are set to report earnings after today's close. Qualcomm will release earnings on Wednesday.

T-notes recovered early losses and are little changed as short covering emerged on today's weaker-than-expected US economic reports on Dec JOLTS job openings and Dec factory orders. </p><p class=\"\">T-notes initially moved lower as the safe-haven demand for T-notes subsided after President Trump delayed imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a month. T-notes are also weighed down by negative carryover from a rise in European government bond yields today. In addition, T-notes were undercut by the inflationary implications of the 10% US tariffs on Chinese goods, which are hawkish for Fed policy. </p><p class=\"\">European government bond yields today are moving higher.
