This enabled us to achieve significant cost savings, deliver strong cash flow, and implement a comprehensive product launch program for the 2025 season.</p><p class=\"\">Challenging market conditions in the fourth quarter</p><p class=\"\">The year's challenging market situation continued into the fourth quarter, with subsequently lower consumer demand. The Group's sales declined organically by 3% and the operating income, excluding items affecting comparability, amounted to SEK -694m (-168) for the fourth quarter.</p><p class=\"\">In the Husqvarna Forest &amp; Garden Division, organic growth was unchanged for the quarter, with growth in handheld and wheeled products, as well as in parts and accessories. Sales in the Gardena Division decreased, with growth for hand tools, while sales of watering products declined. In the Husqvarna Construction Division, sales declined in North America due to a continuation of the challenging market situation, however, our sales increased in Europe.</p><p class=\"\">Strong cash flow and reduced net debt</p><p class=\"\">For the full year 2024, operating income, excluding items affecting comparability, amounted to SEK 3.2bn (5.0). The decrease was due to lower sales volumes with higher promotional activities and a negative product mix. This was partly offset by good results from savings programs, which generated SEK 735m. Direct operating cash flow increased to SEK 6.9bn (6.5), driven by substantial inventory reductions. We have reduced net debt by SEK 1.2bn compared to last year. The Board will propose to the Annual General Meeting a dividend of SEK 1.00 (3.00) for the year, in line with our dividend policy, representing 32% of earnings per share excluding items affecting comparability, or 43% of earnings per share.</p><p class=\"\">Improving results in North America</p><p class=\"\">In recent years, the Husqvarna Forest &amp; Garden Division has taken decisive actions to improve results in North America. Low-margin business has been discontinued and the production structure has been consolidated. We are now entering the next step where we divest our manufacturing facility in Orangeburg, SC, to Flex Ltd. In parallel, we have entered a long-term supplier agreement with Flex, to ensure continued production of the division's wheeled products and assembly of handheld products in the US. This is a partnership that will build profitability, improve capital efficiency, enhance production flexibility and strengthen our competitiveness in North America. Related cost savings are expected to amount to SEK 350m by 2030 (see page 9).</p><p class=\"\">Our strategic transformation continues</p><p class=\"\">Our long-term transformation is about delivering value to customers, shareholders and employees through growth in the focus areas; robotic mowers, battery-powered products, watering and solutions for the professional market. Since 2021 we measure our progress through operational ambitions, including share of electrification, number of connected devices, and sales of robotic mowers. During the year, the share of electrified products reached 44% (42) of our sales of motorized products. Connected devices grew to 4.9 million (4.5). For robotic mowers, net sales amounted to SEK 7.2bn (8.1). We strengthened our position and grew in the professional robotics market. However, sales in the residential segment declined due to increased competition in the low-value segments, as well as restrained consumer spending, particularly for the high value segments. For the 2025 season, we have significantly expanded our range with new boundary wire-free robotic mowers.</p><p class=\"\">As the current strategic period for the Group approaches its end, our focus remains firm — we are continuing to prioritize areas with profitable growth potential, and we will present an update of our strategy at a Capital Markets Day in the fourth quarter of 2025.</p><p class=\"\">We deliver on our sustainability targets</p><p class=\"\">Our ambition to electrify the product range is the main enabler to consistently reduce our carbon footprint. To date, we have reduced CO(2) emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) by -56% compared with the base year of 2015. With that, we have exceeded our target of a -35% reduction by 2025. Work to reduce CO(2) emissions is continuing and includes exploring alternative fuels for some of our products.</p><p class=\"\">I would like to express my gratitude to all colleagues and business partners for their efforts and support during the year. Together, we will continue to focus on opportunities in the market, strengthen our position and aim to increase our profitability. Our cost-saving efforts are successful, and we are well prepared for the 2025 season, with a strong product range and many exciting launches for our customers.\"</p><p class=\"\">Pavel Hajman, CEO</p><p class=\"\">Webcast presentation and telephone conference</p><p class=\"\">A webcast presentation of the Q4 report hosted by Pavel Hajman, CEO and Terry Burke, CFO will be held at 10:00 CET on February 5, 2025.</p><p class=\"\">To view the presentation, please use the link: https://husqvarnagroup.creo.se/4f888317-fb0e-4ca4-9abd-4d677a0dda92</p><p class=\"\">The dial-in to the telephone conference (in order to ask questions): +46 (0) 8 505 100 31 (Sweden) or +44 207 107 06 13 (UK)</p><p class=\"\">Dates for Financial Reports 2025</p><p class=\"\">April 24           Interim report for January-March 2025</p><p class=\"\">April 29           Annual General Meeting 2025</p><p class=\"\">July 18            Interim report for January-June 2025</p><p class=\"\">October 21      Interim report for January-September 2025</p><p class=\"\">Contacts</p><p class=\"\">Terry Burke, CFO and Executive Vice President, Finance, IR &amp; Communication</p><p class=\"\">+46 8 738 90 00</p><p class=\"\">Johan Andersson, Vice President, Investor Relations</p><p class=\"\">+46 702 100 451</p><p class=\"\">Husqvarna AB (publ), P.O.

Lenders took steps to clean up their balance sheets and restore profitability amid high interest rates in recent years and have continued to hand money back to shareholders even as central banks moved to lower rates.</p><p class=\"\">Santander said Wednesday that it expects to return 10 billion euros to shareholders through stock repurchases from its earnings this year and next on top of its dividend. The bank said it plans to start with a new program of about 1.59 billion euros on Thursday for which it already obtained regulatory authorization.</p><p class=\"\">Its plans came hot on the heels of buyback announcements on Tuesday from UBS Group, Intesa Sanpaolo and BNP Paribas.</p><p class=\"\">Santander said it was confident it would be able to boost profitability again in 2025, raising a key profitability target despite projecting broadly stable revenue for the year.</p><p class=\"\">Net profit for the fourth quarter was 3.265 billion euros, up 11% on year, Santander said.</p><p class=\"\">Total income for the quarter rose 10% to 16.03 billion euros, mainly driven by higher net fee income. Net interest income--the difference between what a bank earns on loans and what it pays clients for deposits--came to 11.99 billion euros, up 6.8% on the prior quarter.</p><p class=\"\">Analysts had expected Santander to post a net profit of 2.95 billion euros on revenue of 15.39 billion euros, according to consensus estimates provided by Visible Alpha.</p><p class=\"\">The bank attributed the profit rise to increases at its main income streams that offset higher costs and a hit from a U.K. provision related to cover potential costs from a court ruling on the disclosure of dealer commissions on car loans.</p><p class=\"\">For 2025, Santander expects revenue of about 62 billion euros, mid-high single digit growth in net fee income, lower costs and a return on tangible equity--a key profitability metric for banks--of more than 17%. It had previously targeted a 2025 return on tangible equity of 15% to 17%.</p><p class=\"\">\"Our track record shows that in a challenging market we outperform peers and in 2025 we expect to grow our bottom line and profitability--with revenue stable and costs falling,\" Santander's Executive Chair Ana Botin said.</p><p class=\"\">The bank's full-year revenue climbed 7.9% to 61.88 billion euros in 2024 and its return on tangible equity for the year stood at 16.3%, up from 15.1% a year before.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Adria Calatayud at adria.calatayud@wsj.com</p></span></div>",
