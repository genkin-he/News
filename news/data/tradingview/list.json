            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Brian Swint</p><p class=\"\">Stocks have been dealt two major shocks in the past two weeks — the DeepSeek threat and President Donald Trump's tariffs saga. And yet they've powered on, still trading close to record highs.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, none of the issues that have put markets on edge have gone away. But the quick recovery from what could be serious scares shows that traders are an optimistic bunch--and it's hopefully a good sign for the rally that is now into its third year.</p><p class=\"\">After a 0.7% rally Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 closed just 1.3% off its record high set last month. The Nasdaq jumped 2.4% yesterday to finish within 3% of its high set in December. The market's resilience looks likely to be tested Wednesday, though, as stock futures fell ahead of the open after earnings from Alphabet and Advanced Micro Devices.</p><p class=\"\">Last week, the news that Chinese startup DeepSeek was able to develop artificial intelligence models — apparently at a fraction of the price of U.S. counterparts — sent a jolt through the technology sector, but it quickly recovered. This week, President Donald Trump's announcement of tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China, sent shockwaves through the market, at least until some of them were delayed.</p><p class=\"\">There are plenty of other bad things to pay attention to, if you want to look more closely. Stocks, especially Big Tech, are trading on historically high multiples. The Federal Reserve, spooked by sticky inflation, may not be able to lower interest rates much more. And Trump continues to overwhelm anyone trying to keep up with a whirlwind of new initiatives, the latest being his proposal to take over Gaza.</p><p class=\"\">But it's also worth making a list of the good things. Tariffs still appear, on balance, to be more of a negotiating tactic than a serious threat--even tension with China may simmer down as leaders put phone calls in their diaries. Executives from the biggest tech companies have all shrugged off the threat from DeepSeek. Their comments range from Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai welcoming the competition, to Microsoft's Satya Nadella saying it will stoke demand for AI, to Palantir arguing that a lower AI cost structure will help business.</p><p class=\"\">The bond market, often seen as the wiser older sibling to stocks, has remained calm these past two weeks. Yields are pushing further away from peaks seen last month--the 10-year yield was below 4.5% early Tuesday, down from as high as 4.8% in January. That could be seen as both a sign of composure and a positive indicator for shares, which are valued relative to bonds.</p><p class=\"\">Of course things may still go south. In the early 2000s, the dot com bubble took two slow, long years to burst before it could recover. And keep in mind that traders tend to overreact, both on the way up and the way down. But for now, the market looks like it's staying on its feet.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Organized by the Royal Ocean Racing Club (RORC), the regatta will take place from July 17 to August 1, 2025, in Cowes, on the Isle of Wight. Founded in 1957 and often referred to as the “Unofficial World Cup of Offshore Sailing”, the Admiral’s Cup is making its return after more than twenty years of absence, with the last edition held in 2003. The competition brings together the world’s top sailors for a series of coastal and offshore races, including the Rolex Fastnet Race.</p><p class=\"\">The initiative to participate in the Admiral’s Cup was spearheaded by Peter Harrison, a YCM member and owner of the Jolt boats, with the full support of Pierre Casiraghi, Vice President of the Club and founder of Team Malizia. \"Peter is a great sailor with an outstanding team,\" said Casiraghi. \"When he proposed that we take part in the Admiral’s Cup with the Jolt boats, I immediately accepted this incredible challenge.\" The Monegasque team will field two top-tier boats: the TP52 Jolt 3, skippered by Peter Harrison in the IRC Big Boat class, and the Carkeek 40 Jolt 6, helmed by Pierre Casiraghi. \"We have a solid training program, high-performance boats, and a determined team,\" Casiraghi added. \"Consistency will be key: two poor races can make everything more complicated. We must stay focused and approach each day as a new challenge.\"</p><p class=\"\">This initiative is part of the Yacht Club de Monaco’s broader sporting strategy, inspired by the vision of its President, HSH. Prince Albert II, with the goal of promoting high-level sailing and inspiring younger generations. \"We have followed Boris Herrmann’s journey in the Vendée Globe with pride, admiring his commitment and courage,\" declared the Sovereign Prince. \"This new project embodies our sporting vision. These challenges inspire us and ignite new passions.\"</p><p class=\"\">To take on this new challenge, the Monegasque crew will rely on the expertise of world-class sailors, including Boris Herrmann and Will Harris from Team Malizia, as well as Cole Brauer, the first American woman to complete a solo, non-stop circumnavigation in 130 days, and runner-up in the 2024 Global Solo Challenge. Peter Harrison shares this enthusiasm: \"The Yacht Club de Monaco is a major force in world sailing. Competing in the Admiral’s Cup is a unique opportunity to showcase our experience and passion.\"</p><p class=\"\">The Admiral’s Cup 2025 will bring together over 15 teams representing prestigious yacht clubs, including the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron, the Yacht Club Costa Smeralda, and the New York Yacht Club, a three-time winner of the event. Australia, represented by the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia, is the defending champion, having won the last edition in 2003. The competition will feature a mix of technical inshore races and demanding offshore challenges, where consistency and the overall performance of the crew will be decisive.</p><p class=\"\">By participating in this event, the Yacht Club de Monaco reaffirms its ambition to guide its members toward excellence and to strengthen its influence on the international stage. A great challenge that the Monegasque team is ready to take on with determination and passion.</p><p class=\"\"><em>For more information:</em></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><em>Press Office LaPresse </em></strong><em>- </em><em>ufficio.stampa@lapresse.it</em></p><p class=\"\">A photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/8cf1b899-3c1d-4789-9c8d-c4219a22e967</p></span></div>",

Google Cloud revenue grew to nearly $11.96 billion in the fourth quarter from $9.19 billion a year earlier, below a FactSet forecast of $12.16 billion. Weaker-than-expected growth in cloud computing suggests the AI frenzy isn't automatically translating into big bucks for infrastructure providers, Coatsworth says. Alphabet shares are down 7.4% premarket at $191.12. (mauro.orru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0952 GMT - Alphabet's capital-expenditures target for the year raises fears among investors that the Google owner might be wasting money, AJ Bell's Dan Coatsworth writes in a note to clients. Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said the group expects to invest roughly $75 billion in capex this year. Investors would have welcomed large capex in the past as a sign that Alphabet was doing everything in its power to cash in on the AI frenzy, Coatsworth says. \"Now the reverse is true,\" he says. \"There are fears it might be digging itself a big hole and potentially wasting money if rivals like DeepSeek have shown it is possible to do things a lot cheaper.\" Alphabet shares are down 7.5% premarket at $190.91. (mauro.orru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0950 GMT - Base metal prices are mixed, with LME three-month copper flat at $9,174 a metric ton and LME three-month aluminum down 0.5% at $2,615 a ton. Metal prices rebounded on-week as the U.S. pushed back Canadian and Mexican tariffs one month, but trade tensions and global growth risks are still pressing, RBC Capital Markets' Sam Crittenden says. The U.S. imposed another Chinese import tariff of 10%, while China retaliated with fresh levies, including critical mineral export restrictions. President Trump and China's President Xi will talk over the coming days and U.S. tariffs won't be implemented until Feb. 10, so they could strike a deal before implementation, Crittenden writes. Tariff uncertainty has prompted a significant disconnect between LME and U.S. commodities exchange Comex copper pricing, with the market factoring in more potential trade disputes, the analyst adds. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0935 GMT - TotalEnergies' fourth-quarter results were better than expected and should lift investor sentiment after a weak third quarter, Quilter Cheviot energy and materials analyst Maurizio Carulli writes. Its earnings were boosted by the stabilization of refining margins, which were particularly low in the prior quarter, he adds. The French oil-and-gas company has navigated a challenging 2024 environment well and its attractive long-term growth profile means it is well-positioned for the future, Carulli adds. TotalEnergies shares rise 1% to 57.56 euros. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0933 GMT - Shares of Google owner Alphabet are down Wednesday premarket after the tech giant posted revenue below market expectations for the fourth quarter. Alphabet stock closed 2.6% higher at $206.38 ahead of results on Tuesday. Shares fell in after-hours trading and are down 7% Wednesday premarket, touching a low of $191.10. Revenue in the fourth quarter grew 12% to $96.47 billion, below a FactSet forecast of $96.72 billion. Alphabet hasn't reported a growth rate that low since 2023. (mauro.orru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0932 GMT - Singapore's FTSE Straits Times Index edged 0.2% lower to close at 3815.37, erasing earlier gains amid lingering concerns over U.S. tariffs. \"The proverbial tariff can has just been kicked down the road, with the idea of imposing levies on U.S. imports from its two closest neighbors still not off the table entirely,\" says Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, in an email. Among the worst performers on Singapore's benchmark index, Genting Singapore fell 2.0%, Jardine Matheson Holdings lost 1.4% and SATS Ltd. was down 1.2%. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0919 GMT - TotalEnergies' integrated LNG division meant its fourth-quarter adjusted earnings beat consensus expectations, RBC Capital Markets analysts Biraj Borkhataria and Adnan Dhanani write. The French oil-and-gas company's other divisions were all broadly in line with expectations, they add. Given TotalEnergies hosted its capital markets day in October, is isn't surprising that it didn't outline any major changes to guidance, the analysts write. TotalEnergies shares rise 1% to 57.56 euros. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0912 GMT - The U.K. FTSE 100 index could rise to a new all-time high if the Bank of England signals additional future interest-rate cuts during Thursday's rate decision, Capital.com's Daniela Sabin Hathorn says in a note. \"A BOE rate cut could renew investor interest in U.K. stocks,\" she says. The FTSE 100 reached a new high of 8692.84 on Jan. 31. Any hints of more interest-rate cuts could reignite a U.K. equities rally, Hathorn says. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0910 GMT - Malaysia's benchmark Kuala Lumpur Composite Index ended 0.6% higher at 1574.51 amid bargain hunting. However, continuing concerns about rising U.S.-China trade tensions, fueled by the latest round of tit-for-tat tariffs, could limit further upside in the local benchmark's rebound, TA Securities analyst Stephen Soo says in a note. The KLCI could find support at 1550 and face resistance at 1605, he adds. Among gainers, Gamuda added 4.8% and YTL Power International rose 4.3%. Meanwhile, QL Resources lost 1.1% and SD Guthrie was 0.6% lower. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0859 GMT - The Polish zloty trades steady ahead of the National Bank of Poland's policy decision later. The central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged. This means the decision will be a \"non-event\" with the focus on any signals about future policy, ING analyst Frantisek Taborsky says in a note. The policy statement Wednesday and NBP Governor Adam Glapinski's press conference Thursday could both sound hawkish again by indicating rates will remain restrictive, Taborsky says. \"However, it's hard to imagine at this point what more the governor might add to the hawkish message from January.\" The NBP's decision is expected at 1400 GMT. EUR/PLN trades at 4.2112. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0851 GMT - Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.9% to close at 20597.09, weighed by consumer stocks. U.S.-China tariff developments remained in focus as the U.S. Postal Service said it will pause parcels from China and Hong Kong. Analysts say markets are waiting for the U.S. and China to hold talks on a deal to prevent the trade fight from escalating. Nongfu Spring dropped 6.9%, Trip.com Group lost 6.4% and China Mengniu Diary fell 4.6%. Among advancers, Lenovo Group rose 4.0%, while Orient Overseas (International) and Zhongsheng Group gained 3.1% each. (kimberley.kao@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0850 GMT - Pandora's results are broadly mixed, with 4Q performance in line with expectations but guidance softer than anticipated, RBC Capital Markets analyst Piral Dadhania says in a note. The Danish jeweler reported revenue of 11.97 billion Danish kroner ($1.67 billion) for the final quarter of 2024, up 11% organically on year. Analysts had forecast revenue of 11.85 billion kroner, according to company-compiled consensus. However, the group's guidance of organic revenue growth between 7% and 8% in 2025 is slightly softer than expected, which could prompt low-single-digit earnings revisions, the analyst says. The company expects the EBIT margin target by 2026 at the lower end of the 26% to 27% range, which will likely be received with some caution, Dadhania says. Shares are down 1.3% at 1,356.50 kroner.

Market sentiment is also muted after the Trump administration discussed the potential inclusion of bitcoin in a newly proposed U.S. sovereign wealth fund, sparking speculation over institutional adoption, they say. \"Traders remain focused on regulatory developments and macroeconomic shifts.\" Bitcoin rises 1.1% to $97,523, according to LSEG.

Inevitably, a sustained strength in dollar forces overseas investors to sell dollar-based assets, tightening financial conditions and this typically triggers the Federal Reserve to ease its policy, they say. \"One should look at the U.S. current account deficit for clues on the Fed's policy path.\" The 10-year U.S. Treasury-German Bund yield spread is 212 basis points, up 1 basis point, according to Tradeweb.(emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0943 GMT - The U.K. Debt Management Office auction of the July 2053 green gilt at 1000 GMT is expected to perform well in relative value terms, RBC Capital Markets analysts say in a note. Wednesday's tap is likely to be the final one for the green gilt, which should support demand for the bond, the analysts say. \"We have also observed that outgoing 30-year conventional gilts have consistently outperformed into the end of their tapping cycles,\" RBC says. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0919 GMT - Uncertainties remain around U.S. trade tariffs but easing tensions could improve risk appetite, driving U.S. Treasury yields higher, says Christopher Tahir at Exness. \"Uncertainties about further trade developments could leave investors cautious while new decisions from China and the U.S. could fuel volatility,\" the senior market strategist says in a note. \"Should trade tensions ease, risk appetite could improve, leading to a rebound in yields if traders move out of Treasury bonds.\" The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield falls 3 basis points to 4.480%, according to LSEG data. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0912 GMT - The U.K. FTSE 100 index could rise to a new all-time high if the Bank of England signals additional future interest-rate cuts during Thursday's rate decision, Capital.com's Daniela Sabin Hathorn says in a note. \"A BOE rate cut could renew investor interest in U.K. stocks,\" she says. The FTSE 100 reached a new high of 8692.84 on Jan. 31. Any hints of more interest-rate cuts could reignite a U.K. equities rally, Hathorn says. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0909 GMT - Bank Indonesia may cut rates by 25 bps in 1Q, bringing its policy rate to 5.50%, likely at its February policy meeting, as it prioritizes postpandemic easing, Barclays economist Brian Tan says in a note. Despite stable 4Q GDP growth, policymakers are expected to remain focused on reversing previous rate hikes, he notes. With USD/IDR stable around 16,300, another cut is likely, he reckons. Inflation softened in January, prompting a downward revision to Tan's 2025 average inflation forecast to 1.4% from 1.7%, below BI's 1.5%-3.5% target. If electricity discounts are extended beyond February, inflation could fall further, strengthening the case for continued monetary easing, he adds.

The central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged. This means the decision will be a \"non-event\" with the focus on any signals about future policy, ING analyst Frantisek Taborsky says in a note. The policy statement Wednesday and NBP Governor Adam Glapinski's press conference Thursday could both sound hawkish again by indicating rates will remain restrictive, Taborsky says. \"However, it's hard to imagine at this point what more the governor might add to the hawkish message from January.\" The NBP's decision is expected at 1400 GMT. EUR/PLN trades at 4.2112. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0844 GMT - Singapore's retail sales will likely pick up this year, says OCBC's Selena Ling. Retail sales contracted 2.9% on year in December, marking its worst performance since February 2022, she writes. But with the Singapore Tourism Board expecting 17 million-18.5 million visitors this year that could generate S$29 billion to S$30.5 billion in revenue, things look brighter for the retail sector. Domestic consumption is also expected to be supported by a resilient labor market, Ling says. However, she cautions that external headwinds pose as a key risk for the retail sector, and a challenging trade environment may dampen near-term market sentiment. OCBC expects Singapore's retail sales to expand around 2% in 2025 compared to 2024's 1.2% and 2023's 2.3%.(amanda.lee@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0837 GMT - The Canadian dollar rises to a two-week high against the U.S. dollar as it continues to recover after President Trump agreed to pause a 25% tariff on Canada, ING's Francesco Pesole says in a note. The Canadian dollar could rise further if tariff risks are entirely priced out, he says. There is a residual 1% risk premium embedded into USD/CAD. \"That said, we are not sure markets will or should move to a completely optimistic stance on the U.S.-Canada trade spat.\" There are no clear hints Canada will be spared from another round of potential universal tariffs. USD/CAD could fall to 1.42 in the short-term but risks remain skewed to 1.45 this summer. USD/CAD falls to a low of 1.4289. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0830 GMT - Yields on U.K. government bonds, or gilts, fall ahead of an anticipated interest-rate cut by the Bank of England this week. Markets price in a 98% probability of a 25 basis-point cut to 4.5% on Thursday, LSEG Refinitiv data show. \"I suspect this Thursday's BOE will be sufficiently dovish to strongly raise odds of another cut already at the March meeting,\" Saxo's John Hardy says in a note. The 10-year gilt yield falls 3 basis points to 4.488%, Tradeweb data show. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0822 GMT - The euro's gains will likely prove limited as it remains broadly unattractive given weak macroeconomic fundamentals and President Trump's threats to impose tariffs on the EU, ING analyst Francesco Pesole says. Wide eurozone-U.S. interest rate differentials in favor of the dollar reflect these factors, he says in a note. Trade news will dominate euro price action, although it will be interesting to hear whether the unexpected acceleration in January eurozone inflation triggers some change in the narrative from European Central Bank members. The ECB's chief economist, Philip Lane, is due to speak at 1400 GMT in Washington, DC. The euro rises 0.2% to $1.0402. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0811 GMT - Singapore's retail sales could strengthen this year after a soft performance in 2024, buoyed by new attractions and other tailwinds, UOB associate economist Jester Koh writes in a note. Retail sales fell again in December due to weak tourist arrival numbers. For the full year, retail sales growth fell to 1.2% from 2.3% in 2023, with eight of 14 retail sales categories declining, he notes. Looking ahead, he expects new attractions, including Singapore's fifth zoological park, to lend support to sales. The upcoming budget 2025 is likely to be expansionary and further support measures could also lift sales, he adds. (amanda.lee@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0803 GMT - The 10-year French-Spanish government bond yield spread is gradually nearing the 5 basis point threshold, signalling improving sentiment over France, Natixis analysts say in a note. The spread hasn't reached this level since last November, they say, describing it \"a sign that investor perception of France is less pessimistic than before.\" The 10-year French-Spanish yield differential is 5.6 basis points, according to LSEG data. French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou used special executive powers on Monday to push the 2025 budget through parliament without a vote, while facing a no-confidence motion on Wednesday.
