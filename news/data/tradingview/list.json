Nissan would face pressure surviving amid stiff competition in the U.S. and China, especially as it has a larger risk exposure to U.S. tariffs on Mexico than Honda and Toyota, the analyst says. However, even if the merger goes through, that wouldn't solve the challenges the two companies face. Both carmakers lack compelling EV offerings, and the combined entity would need to build a new EV model pipeline, he says. The two could benefit from larger scale and cost synergy, but that would take time to realize, Sun says. In any case, Nissan would find it difficult to \"play a smaller role in the new entity rather than standing on an equal footing with Honda,\" he adds. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

Financial markets on Tuesday had a muted reaction to China's retaliatory tariffs of 10%-15% on select U.S. goods, but there's a chance of a stronger reaction down the line if negotiations don't see results, Mohi-uddin says. Should U.S. tariffs on China remain at 10% this year, the impact should be manageable, he notes, adding that the measures will trim about 0.5% from China's GDP growth this year from its 5.0% rate in 2024. However, should the tariffs be raised to 20%-30%, growth may fall closer to 4.0%, Mohi-uddin estimates.

(kosaku.narioka@wsj.com; @kosakunarioka)</p><p class=\"\">0717 GMT - The yuan may still face more downward pressure, Maybank's FX analysts say in a research report. \"China remains the only country that President Trump has allowed tariff to take effect on,\" the analysts say. \"Notwithstanding the fact that his trade policies and end goals remain murky at this stage, the developments thus far suggest that China is still taking the brunt of his trade policies,\" the analysts say. Taking into account the tariffs' deadlines, a scenario of an impasse on U.S.-China negotiations would probably prompt the PBOC to \"relent\" on USD/CNY fixings and allow USD/CNY to trend higher, the analysts add. USD/CNH is little changed at 7.2861. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0714 GMT - The impact of Trump's 10% tariff on Chinese exports on China's GDP growth this year looks manageable, Bank of Singapore chief economist Mansoor Mohi-uddin writes in a note. If the 10% levy is maintained for the rest of 2025, that would shave around 0.5% off China's GDP growth, he says. But if tariffs are raised to 20% to 30%, that would likely drag China's economic growth this year to 4.0% from 5.0% last year, he adds. That said, Beijing's retaliation, with targeted tariffs aimed at U.S. exports amounting to only $14 billion, leaves the door open for a potential deal with Washington to avert a broader trade war, he adds.

Trump agreed to postpone the tariffs on Mexico and Canada for a month after talks with the leaders of both countries. \"Perhaps, it is at that point, that we will see tariffs shift from being used as a bargaining chip to further certain political aims, to actually being used as a measure to address trade imbalances,\" Brown says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0659 GMT - Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have dodged tariff bullets for now, but they shouldn't get too comfortable, Moody's Analytics economists say. The three appear obvious targets given their hefty trade surpluses with the U.S. One possible reason is security ties with the U.S. Another is the fact that Japan is among the U.S.'s biggest foreign investors. Korean and Taiwanese firms have been ramping up investment too. That's come at China's expense, aligning with the U.S. bid to curb its influence in supply chains, they add. But the mood could shift and tariffs could come. The economies also face collateral damage. Carmakers like Toyota and Kia have plants in Mexico, and Taiwanese and Korean chip and electronics producers in the U.S. face disruptions via trade barriers or surging production costs.

Foreign and institutional investors were net buyers. LG Energy Solution and Samsung SDI gained 3.6% and 3.4%, respectively, after the government prepared a new aid plan for the EV battery industry. Memory-chip maker SK Hynix added 4.0%. Mobile internet giant Kakao climbed 5.6% after agreeing to develop AI Products with OpenAI. Meanwhile, LG CNS, an IT service affiliate of LG Group, fell 9.9% on its stock exchange debut. USD/KRW settled 1.3% lower at 1,444.30 in Seoul onshore trading.

The city's retail sales by value fell 7.3% in 2024.The easing of visa policies for mainland Chinese visitors to Hong Kong and continued increase in foreign tourists have boosted Hong Kong's visitor numbers, they add. The opening of Kai Tak Sports Park in March and multiple major events including concerts and sporting events should also attract high-spending tourists in 2025 and encourage local consumption, they say. There were encouraging signs in higher visitor numbers from China and other countries over the Lunar New Year holiday, which have boosted hotel bookings and luxury spending, CGS International says. (jiahui.huang@wsj.com; @ivy_jiahuihuang)</p><p class=\"\">0439 GMT - Japan's cash earnings jumped in December, while Moody's Analytics' Stefan Angrick sees little evidence of sustained real wage growth. At first glance, the data suggests things are turning around as monthly cash earnings rose solidly, the economist says, adding that the devil is in the details. Though nominal pay growth is picking up, the gains are uneven, and real cash earnings climbed only 0.6% on year, he says, describing it \"a far more modest gain than the glossy nominal figure.\" The pay bump was also driven significantly by temporary factors, such as bonuses. Wage growth is likely to improve despite strong headwinds expected in 2025, including, but not limited to, a potential inflation spike, he adds. Much depends on the spring wage negotiations. If pay gains come in below 5%, that could delay the rate hikes, he adds. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0422 GMT - Hong Kong PMI data show continued concern among private sector firms about the year ahead as global uncertainty rises. The headline S&amp;P Global PMI for January signaled only a modest improvement in business conditions and slipped to its lowest since September 2024. Weak external demand was the main growth constraint, says Tim Moore, economics director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. \"Survey respondents noted subdued willingness to spend among clients amid concerns about the near-term global economic outlook, in particular the impact of potential U.S. tariffs.\" Export sales fell at the fastest pace since September 2024, while new business from Mainland China decreased to the greatest extent since April 2022. Despite an upturn in total new work, Hong Kong firms remain pessimistic about the year ahead, Moore says.

USD/SGD is little changed at 1.3524. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0339 GMT - The Bank of Korea may cut its policy rate later this month despite January's pickup in domestic inflation, Barclays economist Bum Ki Son writes in a note. Headline inflation accelerated to 2.2% from 1.9% in December, but the BOK may focus on soft core inflation and weak domestic demand, Son says. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, ticked up to 1.9% from 1.8% in December. BOK policymakers see forex-related pressures as limited and oil prices as a one-off shock, he notes. \"As such, we believe inflation is unlikely to stop the BOK from cutting rates 25bp at its February meeting,\" he says.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on KEC International</p><p class=\"\">We revise our EPS estimates by -8.3%/-5.2% factoring in slower margin recovery amid higher revenue mix of non-T&amp;D and upgrade the rating to ‘Accumulate’ from Hold due to recent sharp correction in the stock with a revised TP of Rs930 (Rs997 earlier). KEC International (KEC) reported a revenue growth of 6.8% YoY, while EBITDA margin expanded by 85bps YoY to 7.0%. The domestic T&amp;D opportunity pipeline remains strong, driven by increasing momentum in the power sector. Internationally, T&amp;D prospects are expanding across key regions, including the Middle East, Africa, CIS, and the Americas, with Saudi Arabia leading investments in energy transition and T&amp;D infrastructure. SAE Towers continues to witness healthy demand; however, the depreciation of the Brazilian currency against the USD has tempered growth in this segment. Meanwhile, the Oil &amp; Gas sector continues to face challenges due to tendering delays from Oil PSUs. Persistent labor shortages and collection delays in Water projects and Railways have prompted management to revise its topline growth guidance downward from ~15% to 12-14% YoY. In response, the company remains selective in Civil and Railway order bookings, prioritizing cash flow certainty and shorter execution cycles.</p><p class=\"\">Outlook</p><p class=\"\">We remain positive on KEC for the long term given its 1) strong order book, 2) healthy execution momentum, 3) robust T&amp;D outlook, especially in renewable energy, and 4) expansion of Cables business. The stock is currently trading at a P/E of 17.7x/13.8x on FY26/27E earnings. We value the stock at a PE of 18x on Sep’26E EPS (same as earlier). Upgrade to ‘Accumulate’.</p><p class=\"\">For all recommendations report, click here</p><p class=\"\">Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.
