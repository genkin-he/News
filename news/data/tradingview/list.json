However, the cryptocurrency market remains volatile, and external factors—such as tariff policies, broader economic conditions, and Bitcoin’s performance—can influence XRP’s price. </p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Could XRP reach $5?</strong></p><p class=\"\">According to projections from DeepSeek AI, a predictive analytics platform mentioned in the article, XRP could trade in the $3.50 to $5.00 range by late 2025. This forecast assumes a favorable outcome in Ripple’s ongoing legal matters and increased institutional interest through the On-Demand Liquidity platform. </p></span></div>",

On the monetary policy front, CreditSights expects the PBOC to allow only moderate FX depreciation and delay high-profile monetary easing, such as rate cuts, to avoid escalation. On the fiscal front, the firm anticipates more expansionary policies to cushion against external risks. Retaliatory measures and headlines could dampen global risk sentiment and are negative for Asian credits, despite their limited direct exposure to U.S. revenues, Zeng and Stephanie Sim note. \"We expect market sentiment towards China $ bonds to weaken if no concrete incremental fiscal stimulus are rolled out by 1H,\" they write.
