EBITDA decreased 2.2% YoY (-7.1% QoQ) to INR 10,846 Mn, missed our estimates mainly due to higher-than-expected operating expenses. EBITDA margin contracted 143 bps YoY (-19 bps QoQ) to 22.7%.

However, long-term growth remains strong, supported by innovation, premiumization, capacity expansion, and ecommerce momentum. We expect Revenue/EBITDA/Adj.

It <br/>is not necessarily the case that all financial information in this press <br/>release is equivalent to financial statements of companies in the United <br/>States. It may be difficult to enforce any right or claim arising under U.S. <br/>federal securities laws because the Offeror and Makino Milling Machine Co., <br/>Ltd.

The French oil-and-gas company's other divisions were all broadly in line with expectations, they add. Given TotalEnergies hosted its capital markets day in October, is isn't surprising that it didn't outline any major changes to guidance, the analysts write.

(kimberley.kao@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0850 GMT - Pandora's results are broadly mixed, with 4Q performance in line with expectations but guidance softer than anticipated, RBC Capital Markets analyst Piral Dadhania says in a note. The Danish jeweler reported revenue of 11.97 billion Danish kroner ($1.67 billion) for the final quarter of 2024, up 11% organically on year. Analysts had forecast revenue of 11.85 billion kroner, according to company-compiled consensus. However, the group's guidance of organic revenue growth between 7% and 8% in 2025 is slightly softer than expected, which could prompt low-single-digit earnings revisions, the analyst says. The company expects the EBIT margin target by 2026 at the lower end of the 26% to 27% range, which will likely be received with some caution, Dadhania says. Shares are down 1.3% at 1,356.50 kroner. (andrea.figueras@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0847 GMT - Novo Nordisk's 2025 outlook is reassuring, says Sheena Berry at Quilter Cheviot. The Danish pharmaceutical company expects a robust 16%-24% sales growth for the year, Berry says. Fourth-quarter sales rose 30%, outpacing expectations, although this was partly driven by insulin rebate adjustments, she notes. The performance of key growth drivers, Ozempic and Wegovy, remains strong, with Ozempic meeting expectations and Wegovy slightly underperforming. Novo Nordisk is set to initiate a new CagriSema Phase 3 trial in 2025 and plans to file with regulators in the first quarter of 2026, a slight delay to ensure a secure supply chain.

The Irish research firm forecasts that DCC could receive 1.365 billion pounds for the division. This is more than 15 times the FY 2025 Ebitda expectations of 88 million pounds, the analyst adds in a note. Assuming that most of the cash will be returned to shareholders, this means that the disposal will unlock significant value as the deal could be far ahead of DCC's current valuation, Grant adds. DCC said in its third-quarter update that the disposal is progressing in line with expectations, the analyst says. Shares are down 2.4% at 53.65 pounds. (michael.susin@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0838 GMT - Novo Nordisk's initial 2025 outlook is just ahead of Jefferies's expectations. But given a higher starting point and stronger currency effects it suggests up to 6% sales and 10% EBIT consensus upgrades, analysts at the bank write. Novo Nordisk's fourth-quarter sales beat expectations by 5%, mostly on positive U.S. gross-to-net adjustments--the discount offered between the list price and the actual net sales price--for its insulins. Sales of Wegovy were shy of expectations while Ozempic and Rybelsus were in line. A better gross margin, higher research and development costs but less selling and distribution spend helped EBIT beat by 9% and EPS by 6%. The stock will likely tick higher initially but could then fade, Jefferies says. Shares trade 4.2% higher at 617.20 Danish kroner. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0837 GMT - GSK needs to convince investors of a sustainable vaccine outlook after it cut the 2025 sales target of its jabs, Shore Capital analyst Sean Conroy says. The British pharma company now guides for a low single-digit decrease in vaccine sales for this year after a slowdown in the U.S., notably for its RSV shot Arexvy that missed consensus estimates by 18%, the analyst says. \"Some tangible evidence the transient challenges facing Shingrix [shingles vaccine] and Arexvy can be navigated will likely be needed to reinstill the conviction in management's longer-term expectations for these,\" he says in a note. Shares are up 5.7% at 1,458.50 pence. (helena.smolak@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0834 GMT - The cancellation of the \"de minimis\" rule, which allowed low-value shipments to bypass duties and custom scrutiny, as well as the subsequent suspension of Chinese goods shipments by the U.S. Postal Services, should be manageable for PDD Holdings' Temu, says Nomura analyst Jialong Shi tells Dow Jones Newswires. Temu has been preparing for this change in the past year, Shi notes, pointing to the company introducing a half consignment model in early 2024. Under this model, merchants typically ship products to the U.S. in bulk rather than relying on the so-called \"de minimis\" exemption, which was recently revoked by President Trump, Shi notes. While Temu still has significant growth potential in the U.S. market at this stage, uncertainties remain over whether the U.S. government will introduce new regulations to these Chinese companies, he says.

The French oil-and-gas company has navigated a challenging 2024 environment well and its attractive long-term growth profile means it is well-positioned for the future, Carulli adds.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Joseph Pisani and Betsy McKay</p><p class=\"\">Elon Musk, the billionaire adviser to President Trump, has targeted the U.S. Agency for International Development as part of the Trump administration's push to slash federal spending.</p><p class=\"\">In less than two weeks, the administration has moved swiftly to dismantle the work of the 10,000-person, $40 billion foreign assistance agency and the thousands of people who work in nonprofits and other groups that partner with it.</p><p class=\"\">This weekend, Musk's Department of Government Efficiency moved to exert control over the foreign-aid organization, clashing with security officials and ultimately accessing the agency's classified systems. The administration closed USAID's headquarters at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., to workers on Monday, instructing them to work remotely.</p><p class=\"\">Trump said he planned to fold USAID into the State Department by executive order, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Monday that he was the acting director of USAID. The administration removed the agency's website, USAID.gov, and placed it into a subsection of the State Department's website.</p><p class=\"\">Musk suggested on his social-media platform X that he wanted to close down the agency entirely — and USAID's X profile was taken down.</p><p class=\"\">On Tuesday, all of USAID's Washington facilities were closed, as the agency prepared to put nearly all of its remaining 1,400 staffers on administrative leave, two officials said.</p><p class=\"\">The big announcement came later that night: Nearly all USAID staff would be put on paid administrative leave starting Saturday morning, with aides working around the world ordered to come home within 30 days, barring special circumstances.</p><p class=\"\">Here's what to know about USAID:</p><p class=\"\">What is USAID?</p><p class=\"\">USAID provides financial aid to countries around the world — combating human trafficking, battling diseases, feeding people in places with famine and supporting American-allied countries affected by war, such as Ukraine. It also funds equipment, medicine and staffing in countries battling pandemics and disease outbreaks.</p><p class=\"\">The organization gave assistance to about 130 countries in fiscal year 2023. The top 10 recipients were Ukraine, Ethiopia, Jordan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Nigeria, South Sudan and Syria. In Ukraine, for instance, USAID funds farmers and pays to keep heat and electricity running when Russia attacks the country's infrastructure.</p><p class=\"\">USAID buys corn, beans and rice from U.S. farmers to distribute to other countries. USAID said it bought 1.1 million metric tons of food from U.S. farmers and ranchers in 2023.</p><p class=\"\">Can Musk shut down USAID?</p><p class=\"\">Democrats, and some Republicans have said Musk doesn't have the authority to overturn programs and spending priorities decided by Congress.</p><p class=\"\">President John F. Kennedy created the agency in 1961, based on a foreign-assistance law Congress passed that year. For decades, it was part of the State Department. Congress made it an independent agency in 1998.</p><p class=\"\">Dissolving USAID as an independent agency would take another act of Congress, said Matthew Kavanagh, director of the Center for Global Health Policy &amp; Politics at Georgetown University. Article I of the Constitution gives Congress the prerogative to create or abolish agencies, he said.</p><p class=\"\">Rubio said Monday that he would work with Congress to overhaul USAID, and promised to review the agency's activities and operations. He told lawmakers the review may eliminate certain aid programs.</p><p class=\"\">Two Democratic senators, Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, vowed to place holds on the Trump administration's nominees to serve at the State Department unless USAID was back up and running.</p><p class=\"\">Why are Trump and Musk targeting USAID?</p><p class=\"\">Gutting USAID fits into Trump's campaign promise to cut aid to foreign countries.</p><p class=\"\">Republican critics say USAID is wasting taxpayer money on programs that promote liberal causes, such as abortion. USAID has said it is barred from funding abortions by law. It does fund post-abortion care for women to prevent maternal deaths, the agency has said. Rubio said Monday USAID's work has to be aligned with American foreign policy.</p><p class=\"\">Musk called USAID corrupt without providing evidence. \"USAID is a criminal organization,\" he wrote in one post on X. \"Time for it to die.\"</p><p class=\"\">Democrats say USAID saves lives and provides foreign aid quickly in times of crisis. USAID supporters also say the agency is an important tool of diplomacy, separate from foreign policy.</p><p class=\"\">How big is USAID?</p><p class=\"\">The agency had a budget of roughly $44.2 billion in fiscal 2024, or 0.4% of the federal budget, according to USAspending.gov, which tracks government spending data. It has more than 10,000 workers. About two-thirds of them serve overseas, according to the Congressional Research Service.</p><p class=\"\">What would happen if USAID were shut down or significantly diminished?</p><p class=\"\">Large cuts in humanitarian aid could mean people outside the U.S. lose access to vaccines, food and maternal care, said Maryam Deloffre, associate professor of international affairs at George Washington University.</p><p class=\"\">\"I think the potential could be really catastrophic,\" said Deloffre. \"I'm hoping we don't get to that point.\"</p><p class=\"\">Moving the agency under the State Department could threaten its ability to execute its foreign aid mission. \"Suggesting the State Department, which deals in policy, can morph into an effective operational humanitarian and aid agency is absurd,\" Kavanagh from Georgetown said.</p><p class=\"\">This explanatory article may be updated periodically.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Joseph Pisani at joseph.pisani@wsj.com and Betsy McKay at betsy.mckay@wsj.com</p></span></div>",
