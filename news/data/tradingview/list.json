            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">The yen strengthens against other G-10 and Asian currencies in the morning session. Japanese data released earlier showed the economy's real wages rose 0.6% in December from a year earlier, marking a second straight month of increases. A solid rise in Japanese labor cash earnings will reinforce the current market pricing in at least one more rate hike by the BOJ this year, CBA's Joseph Capurso says in a note. In addition, with the 'tariff war' between the U.S. and other countries seemingly ongoing, the AUD/JPY is likely to retest support at 94.69, the head of International and Sustainable Economics adds. USD/JPY falls 0.6% to 153.36; AUD/JPY drops 0.7% to 95.88. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

January data point to a solid upturn in business activity across the sector, accompanied by a steeper, solid rise in new business inflows. The survey signaled a sharp jump in average prices charged by service providers, while exports rose for the first time in four months. Firms are upbeat on their prospects over the coming 12 months and have boosted staffing levels, says Usamah Bhatti, economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Services continue to underpin growth in Japan's private sector, contrasting the weakness in manufacturing. Still, companies are confident that private-sector activity will rise over 2025, expecting a rebound in manufacturing output and a broad-based economic recovery, Bhatti says.

Mark Smith, senior economist at ASB Bank expects demand for labor will continue to weaken until a modest economic recovery finally shows up in the second half of 2025. Firms will have to carefully manage employee headcount in that time, he adds. With inflation close to the target midpoint and monetary settings still slowing the economy, further swift monetary easing looks appropriate to limit economic and labor market scarring, he adds.

Industry leaders, including at least 22 industry giants , have initiated advocating this adoption.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Unlocking the Benefits</strong>While 1D barcodes changed the landscape of retail and manufacturing, QR codes present a substantial upgrade.

Consumer goods companies can direct buyers to additional product information, like nutritional information or sample food recipes using a QR Code. In healthcare, these codes can boost patient education through linking products to essential usage and safety, limiting reliance on printed materials.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Overcoming Challenges</strong>Adopting GS1 Digital Link QR codes is not without hurdles. The transition requires investment in updated scanning technology, which may be cost-prohibitive for some businesses. Additionally, concerns about data security persist, as QR code-related scams have been reported by the FBI since 2022.</p><p class=\"\">Consumer education is also one key challenge. While QR codes are popular, many are still unfamiliar with its full capabilities, hindering swift adoption. To address this, GS1 US has provided ample resources to aid organizations preparing for sunrise 2027.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">A New Era for Businesses and Consumers</strong>With GS1 leading the charge in promoting and easing the shift towards a new dimension of barcodes, businesses stand to enhance consumer engagement, seamless operations, and supply chain visibility. </p><p class=\"\">This opportunity to increase sales, elevated transparency, and remarkable consumer experiences is just too good for any business to pass up.</p><p class=\"\">Edrian Ostulano</p><p class=\"\">Public Relations and Communications Manager</p><p class=\"\">QRTIGER CORP</p><p class=\"\">+639273404704</p><p class=\"\">edrian@qrtiger.me</p><p class=\"\">https://www.qrcode-tiger.com</p></span></div>",
