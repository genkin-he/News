These releases join Boann’s celebrated portfolio of spirits, including Silks Irish Dry Gin and The Whistler Irish Whiskey. Each whiskey (47% ABV | SRP $69/700 ml) is crafted with award-winning Single Pot Still spirit and aged in carefully selected casks to deliver unique and distinct flavor profiles.</p><p class=\"\">The new expressions honor the 160-year tradition of Single Pot Still whiskey distillation in the heart of Ireland’s Boyne Valley. Boann’s Managing Director and Founder, Pat Cooney, shared the vision behind the release: “This is the beginning of a journey to bring Irish whiskey back to its rightful place as a global leader. Single Pot Still Irish Whiskey is uniquely Irish, and we’re reviving the heritage of Ireland’s lost distilleries while uniting traditional methods with modern innovation.”</p><p class=\"\">The three expressions are presented in bespoke bottles designed to reflect the essence of grain, water, and wood.

As a leading dental healthcare and orthodontics delivery organization committed to providing quality care to underserved communities, Benevis is steadfast in advocating for programs and legislation that ensure all families have access to the oral healthcare they need and deserve.</p><p class=\"\">In the U.S., 38% of children ages zero-18 have dental benefits through Medicaid or CHIP. Of that government-sponsored insurance population, the American Dental Association found that only 47% of children saw a dentist in the last 12 months. Social determinants of health (SDOH), such as socioeconomic status and race, have been recognized as major contributors to oral diseases in children. The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research goes on to share that children from vulnerable populations have less access to oral health care and generally experience more dental caries. This data reveals the significant unmet oral health treatment needs for U.S. children.</p><p class=\"\">\"The landscape of dental insurance coverage continues to evolve for U.S. families. Nevertheless, we must remember what is at the heart of this issue - children’s health,\" explained Bryan Carey, CEO, Benevis. \"Government leaders should prioritize oral health just as they do physical health. It’s vital to ensure equitable access to quality oral care, breaking down Medicaid and CHIP coverage barriers—especially in underserved and marginalized communities where the impact of limited oral healthcare is most profound.\" </p><p class=\"\">Also common for children is the prevalence of dental caries, also known as cavities. Half of children (50%) aged six to nine years old have had cavities in their primary (baby) or permanent teeth; children of the same age group from low-income households are two times more likely (25%) to have untreated cavities than children from high-income households (10%); and one in 10 adolescents aged 12 to 19 years old have at least one untreated cavity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p class=\"\">“Educating families about the importance of oral hygiene is one of the most impactful ways our care teams can help prevent tooth decay,” shared Dr. Jane Whang, Regional Director of Clinical at Benevis. “For children and their families, the importance of early intervention and oral health education is critical to ensuring a lifetime of happy, healthy smiles.\" </p><p class=\"\">For healthy teeth tips, Benevis has created the Children's Dental Health Month infographic, which can be viewed here. </p><p class=\"\">For patients to confirm if they qualify for Medicaid or CHIP benefits, click here. To find a list of dental Medicaid or CHIP plans in each state, click here.  </p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Benevis</strong> </p><p class=\"\">Benevis is a leading dental healthcare delivery organization for practices focused on delivering life-changing oral care and orthodontics to underserved communities. Through comprehensive care and operational services that expand access to dentistry, Benevis has a 20-year history of providing the highest quality care to approximately 5 million children and adults. Its network reaches more than 100 locally branded dental offices across the U.S. that deliver treatment through 1.4 million visits each year.

Now senators Welch, Sanders and Warren have been joined by Maryland's Chris Van Hollen and Conneticut's Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal in reintroducing the legislation. It is supported by several agriculture-focused advocacy groups.</p><p class=\"\">The FCIC already provides indemnity-based and parametric coverage for various crops, and last year paid out hundreds of millions of dollars after hurricanes including Helene and Milton. But, Senator Sanders said, \"The current federal crop insurance options are not workable for many of the small and diversified farms we have in Vermont.\"</p><p class=\"\">Senator Van Hollen said the legislation would modernise federal crop insurance and improve the stability of the country's food supply. Senator Blumenthal added, \"With this essential legislation, we work to improve our farm safety nets for producers in order to make sure they receive the support they need to weather the storm and keep their farms thriving.\"</p></span></div>",

This estimate reflects the present value of the expected economic benefit from seed money and the synergies expected from the transaction, net of integration costs and higher taxes.\"</p><p class=\"\">Revenue synergies and operational efficiencies have been identified totalling €210mn annually pre-tax, driven by greater growth potential and cross-selling opportunities. This does not include the expected contribution from the future deployment of seed money, which could contribute to a further increase in estimated revenues through the launch of new high-potential products.</p><p class=\"\">The proposed transaction would, at closing, result in an overall impact of €25mn and €50mn including costs to achieve over the first two years.
