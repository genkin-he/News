            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">United States President Donald Trump Monday delayed the start of tariffs on imports from Canada by 30 days, within hours of coming into effect, noted Bank of Montreal (BMO). </p><p class=\"\">Earlier Monday, he did the same for Mexico. The 25% tariff on all non-energy imports from Canada and 10% tariff on energy imports, along with the 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico, are still pending. </p><p class=\"\">However, the bilateral agreements struck to postpone them paved pathways for both countries to potentially avoid them completely, said the bank. </p><p class=\"\">After President Trump signed the executive order on Saturday putting the tariffs into place, BMO factored them into its Canadian and U.S. economic forecasts. </p><p class=\"\">For Canada, the broad theme, compared to the bank's base case, was much weaker growth — flirting with recession —, moderately higher inflation thanks to retaliatory tariffs, much lower Bank of Canada policy rates as growth concerns trumped inflation fears and a much weaker Canadian dollar (CAD or loonie) owing to a stronger US dollar (USD) and BoC rate cuts. For the U.S., the broad theme was modestly slower growth and faster inflation. </p><p class=\"\">These tariffs, for the reasons named in the executive order, have shifted from being an essential certainty to now being a risk. BMO's original (pre-Saturday) base case already factored in some risk of tariffs. The bank's forecast for Canadian growth was dampened by lower business spending than would have otherwise be the case owing to the uncertainty (growth would have easily topped 2% this year instead of being 1.9%), with the BoC continuing to ease policy through the summer — a further 50 bps. </p><p class=\"\">Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar languished above C$1.40 for much of the year. Consequently, BMO has mostly returned to where it was before, in terms of its forecast. </p><p class=\"\">However, this tariff 'scare' is leaving a legacy, pointed out the bank. </p><p class=\"\">It raises the risk of tariffs being used more often for objectives other than international trade policy. More importantly, it leaves BMO even more uneasy about what to expect on and after April 1. </p><p class=\"\">By that date, there will be three reports delivered to the president (under the America First Trade Policy memorandum) that should be full of tariff recommendations backed by formal investigations, or soon-to-be. This should set the stage for more 'Section 232' (national security) and 'Section 301' (unfair trade practices) tariffs. </p><p class=\"\">More profoundly, they will probably make the case for a 'global supplementary tariff'. Will Canada be shielded from such in a renegotiated USMCA? Lots of uncertainty, indeed, added BMO. </p><p class=\"\">In turn, the bank's new base case has slightly weaker Canadian growth than the original (1.7% versus 1.9% for 2025), a slightly weaker loonie (now staying above C$1.40 all year) and meaningfully more downside risk to BMO's BoC call</p><p class=\"\">of 50bps worth of rate cuts by this summer. </p><p class=\"\">What the latest episode has taught BMO is that even with signed legal documents and hard deadlines, this is still a fluid situation. Consequently, this is unlikely to be the bank's last forecast alteration.</p></span></div>",

Meanwhile, U.S. tech earnings have been well-received by the market, helping to ease concerns.

In a note, analyst Matt Montgomerie thinks the tariff threat shouldn't have a material impact on F&amp;P Healthcare's valuation at this stage because the tariffs may ultimately be reversed or revised. Also, F&amp;P Healthcare can shift production back to New Zealand and use Mexico as a hub for other markets. \"The latter would take time to implement, but over the long term there shouldn't be a material change in F&amp;P Healthcare's gross margin outlook,\" Forsyth Barr says. \"This is confirmed by F&amp;P Healthcare still expecting to reach its 65% target, albeit two to three years later than its original FY 2027/FY 2028 expectations.\" (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)</p><p class=\"\">1655 ET - Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare could manufacture more in New Zealand over time as it adjusts to U.S. tariffs on Mexico where it has factories, but such an approach is constrained by staff availability, Jefferies says.

On staff, F&amp;P Healthcare could benefit from higher unemployment in New Zealand. But this would be partly offset by lower net migration, Jefferies says. \"F&amp;P Healthcare would also need new regulatory approval to sell products manufactured in different facilities which may take some months, especially if there is an increase in applications for approval,\" Jefferies adds.

(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1852 ET - The more than 8% drop in Origin Energy's share price that followed a downgrade to annual production guidance for the Australia Pacific LNG project was overdone, contends UBS. The stock reaction ignores several tailwinds that could trigger upgrades to consensus earnings expectations for FY 2026, analyst Tom Allen says. They include a 15%-20% decline in current coal prices, UBS says, noting 45% of Origin's coal costs are unhedged. Origin also wants to expand a battery at the Eraring power station in Australia to become one of the largest battery storage systems in the world. \"We do not believe these incremental earnings (A$100 million per annum from 2H FY 2026) are factored into consensus estimates,\" UBS says.

Meanwhile, as a 10% U.S. tariff on Chinese imports came into effect Tuesday, Beijing announced its decision to retaliate with a 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas imports and a 10% levy on American crude oil and agricultural machinery, starting Monday.

On a seasonally-adjusted basis, light-vehicle sales came at a \"strapping\" 2.15 million, DesRosiers says. The firm adds it's difficult to put January's performance in context, given Trump's tariff threat.

CPKC has 41% of its revenue tied to cross-border trade, according to RBC. Sustained tariffs, the analysts say, over a longer period of time could derail its growth plans. \"Moreover, we see many of the company's Investor Day growth targets as dependent on cross-border trade and therefore flag risk to long-term consensus EPS growth estimates should tariffs at current levels be sustained,\" the analysts say.

The Canadian Automotive Partnership Council in a meeting with Canadian lawmakers warned tariffs pose an existential threat to the industry in Canada and the U.S. and costs ultimately being borne by consumers. The industry body notes bilateral automotive trade is balanced, with Canadian exports to the U.S. at C$82 billion and imports at C$79 billion in 2023. And it stresses Canadian-made vehicles don't pose a threat to U.S. automotive jobs or production mandates: fewer than 10% of vehicles sold in the U.S. are produced in Canada, whereas the U.S. assembles about half of the vehicles sold in Canada and exports more vehicles to Canada than to any other country.

A 10% universal tariff imposed by the U.S. might shave 0.1% to 0.2% off eurozone GDP, he says in a note. But a 25% tariff, as imposed but suspended on Canada and Mexico, would have a more-than-proportionately larger effect because it would be harder for companies and exchange-rate moves to cushion the blow, Kenningham warns. A ball-park estimate is that would cut eurozone GDP by around 0.5%, leaving growth close to zero this year. Additionally, a prohibitive tariff of, say, 100% on European vehicles could on its own push Germany into recession.

Bloomberg reported Tuesday that talks between the ride-hailing companies over a possible combination have recently intensified. They would likely save costs on competing user subsidies, as well as see faster new user acquisition with broader product offerings and better reach to lower-tier cities, Yap says. There could also be better user targeting, cross-selling of financial services and increased advertising revenue on both platforms, Yap adds. Both brands would likely continue running independently, but there could be back-end integration of systems and more collaboration regarding merchant management and sharing their rider and vehicle pool, Yap adds.
