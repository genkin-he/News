            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">LJUBLJANA (Slovenia), February 4 (SeeNews) - Slovenia’s economic growth is forecast to pick up to an annual average of around 2.5% in 2025 and 2026 on the back of a continued recovery of domestic consumption and investment activity, supported by EU funds, specialist credit insurance firm Allianz Trade said.</p><p class=\"\">\"The economic outlook for Slovenia has deteriorated because of the war in Ukraine but the economy has proven more resilient than most peers among the EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE),\" Allianz Trade said on Monday in its annual research Country Risk Atlas 2025.</p><p class=\"\">Allianz Trade said that Slovenia’s growth remained weak in 2024, with domestic consumption and restocking becoming the main drivers, while the corresponding rebound in imports turned the contribution of net trade to overall growth slightly negative. Slovenia’s full-year growth came in at 2.7% in 2022 and 2.1% in 2023, supported by a strong increase in fixed investment and net exports.</p><p class=\"\">Inflationary pressures in Slovenia have been milder than in peer central and eastern Europe countries, Allianz Trade said. Consumer price inflation rose to a peak of 11% in July 2022 and hovered around 10.5% until March 2023 before falling to 4.2% on the year in December and further to just 0.0% on the year in October 2024, thanks to markedly reduced energy prices. \"As the effect of declining energy prices will fade and owing to strengthening price pressures for recreation, headline inflation is likely to pick up in the next quarters,\" according to the research. Allianz Trade expects annual average inflation to come in at slightly above 2% in 2025 and drop to target again by 2026.</p><p class=\"\">Allianz Trade rates Slovenia's business environment as strong. Its Environmental Sustainability Index ranks Slovenia 17th out of 210 economies, citing strengths in energy use, CO2 emissions per GDP, water stress, and climate resilience. Weaknesses include renewable electricity output, while the recycling rate is moderate.</p><p class=\"\">\"Overall systemic political risk is low. Slovenia is a well established democracy and has good international relations, reflected in its EU, OECD and NATO membership. Broad policy continuity can be expected after national elections. Slovenia’s sovereign creditworthiness is not at risk as all major political parties support fiscal discipline. Lastly, eurozone membership provides for moderate transfer and convertibility risk in Slovenia,\" Allianz Trade concluded.</p> </span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">CHALK RIVER, Ontario, Feb.  04, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL), Canada’s premier nuclear science and technology organization, is pleased to announce it has expanded the scope of its SMR siting invitation program to help organizations pursue commercial opportunities and seize a leadership position in the development and deployment of other new and innovative clean energy technologies.</p><p class=\"\">Given the continued development of other novel technologies, and CNL’s growing capabilities and expertise across other clean energy categories, the program is being expanded beyond fission based SMRs and other advanced reactor designs. Now known as CNL’s Clean Energy Siting Program, the new program will also invite vendors and technology developers interested in building prototype solutions that include fusion-based technologies, hydrogen production, battery storage and clean fuel production facilities, among others. Overall, the intent is to support the Government of Canada achieve its net-zero objectives, help Canadians businesses develop new and innovative technologies, and make CNL’s resources available to the private sector.</p><p class=\"\">“Through CNL’s ongoing engagements with clean energy leaders in Canada and around the world, it was clear there was an opportunity for us to expand and grow our SMR siting program, in order to support prototype construction and testing for other clean energy technologies,” commented Jack Craig, CNL’s President and CEO. “More importantly, Canada has set ambitious domestic targets in clean energy, and if we are to meet them, we must recognize that there is no one solution that will address a challenge of this scale and significance. To fight climate change and realize energy security, it will take all these promising technologies working in tandem with one another. That is at the heart of our renewed program, and it is our belief that we can help to accelerate the deployment of these promising technologies and maximize their full potential.”</p><p class=\"\">As a federal Crown corporation, AECL owns and oversee the sites under management by CNL. “AECL is pleased to see the expansion of the siting program to include even more approaches to clean energy production, use, and storage,” said Fred Dermarkar, AECL’s President and CEO. “This is another example of the value of Canada’s investment in its national nuclear laboratories. Our model allows us to connect commercial and academic partners with Canada’s unique nuclear science assets. This new, expanded program could not be possible without the innovative collaboration between the federal government and the private sector. AECL is proud to facilitate this new invitation process,” added Dermarkar.</p><p class=\"\">“CNL will continue to work closely with SMR vendors who are already navigating our siting program, and it is our hope that we will see an SMR sited at one of the sites we manage on behalf of AECL in the very near future,” added Dr. Stephen Bushby, CNL’s Vice-President of Science and Technology. “But given all the advances that have been realized in recent years across a number of different clean energy categories, it only makes sense that we expand our siting program to support the development of these technologies and do everything we can to bring them to the market.”</p><p class=\"\">Under the renewed program, applicants pursuing a clean energy demonstration project must still proceed through four individual stages, though these phases have been updated to align with the more collaborative approach of the renewed program. Depending on the interest and suitability of the applications, these projects could be located at the Chalk River Laboratories or the Whiteshell Laboratories site. Both sites are located on the traditional lands, waterways and ceded and unceded territories of Indigenous peoples; meaningful engagement with Indigenous peoples will be a key component of any successful project.</p><p class=\"\">While the invitation process does not include access to CNL’s research facilities or other ancillary programs, CNL is very much open to discussion with proponents regarding collaborative approaches to help advance their individual projects.</p><p class=\"\">To learn more about CNL, including its new Clean Energy Siting Program please visit www.cnl.ca.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About CNL </strong></p><p class=\"\">As Canada’s premier nuclear science and technology laboratory and working under the direction of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL), CNL is a world leader in the development of innovative nuclear science and technology products and services.

– where again policy could change as soon as someone else takes office. </p><p class=\"\">This leaves them making decisions “based on hunches,” Palmer says, “which is always very dangerous.” </p><p class=\"\">Recommended reading: </p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\">Scania tries to save Northvolt </p></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\">U.S. tariffs on China hit crude  </p></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\">Volvo teams with Waabi for driverless trucks  </p></li></ul><p class=\"\">    Under pressure, the EU talks EVs  </p><p class=\"\">The European Commission met with European automakers, unions and interest groups to figure out how to breathe fresh life into efforts to make the shift to electric and help the continent’s auto industry fend off competition from U.S. and Chinese rivals.   </p><p class=\"\">The talks came at a tough time for Europe’s car industry struggling with those challenges, which have spurred factory closures and job cuts, including 54,000 job losses among auto suppliers in 2024. </p><p class=\"\">Europe’s car industry is laser focused on one issue: pushing ways for the EU to ditch or waive fines for failing to comply with tough new CO2 targets in 2025, that more than one in five cars they sell this year needs to be fully electric.  </p><p class=\"\">That is well above EVs’ 13.6% EU share of the new car market last year, which has led the industry to issue dire warnings that Europe’s automakers could face fines of up to 15 billion euros this year.    </p><p class=\"\">The European association representing EV makers, battery makers, charging companies and others that have been investing in readiness for an electric world issued research on Monday that says new lower-cost EVs will help the auto industry comply with the CO2 targets and that instead of waiving fines the EU beef up incentives to encourage consumers to buy EVs. </p><p class=\"\">    BYD’s tough contracts for workers in Brazil </p><p class=\"\">BYD used contracts for workers from China to build a new car factory in Brazil including clauses that violate labor laws in both countries, according to an exclusive report from my Reuters colleagues Fabio Teixeira, Luciana Novaes Magalhaes and Lisandra Paraguassu. You can read it here.  </p><p class=\"\">The workers who traveled from China to northeast Brazil to build the factory earned roughly $70 per 10-hour shift, more than twice the Chinese hourly minimum wage in many regions.  </p><p class=\"\">But the workers hired by BYD contractor Jinjiang in Brazil had to hand over their passports to their new employer, let most of their wages be sent directly to China, and hand over an almost $900 deposit that they could only get back after six months' work. </p><p class=\"\">The contract also gave the firm the power to unilaterally extend the labor contract for six months and issue 200-yuan fines for conduct such as swearing, quarreling or walking around shirtless at the site or in their living quarters. </p><p class=\"\">BYD says it had no knowledge of any violations until initial reports emerged in Brazilian media outlets in late November. </p><p class=\"\">    Nissan’s U.S. buyouts  </p><p class=\"\">Nissan is offering buyouts to workers and cutting back shifts at its three U.S. factories as the Japanese automaker pushes to slash $2.6 billion in costs globally. </p><p class=\"\">Nissan will offer buyout packages to workers at its vehicle assembly plants in Smyrna, Tennessee, and Canton, Mississippi, and an engine plant in Decherd, Tennessee. </p><p class=\"\">The automaker will cut one of two shifts making its Rogue sports utility vehicle in Smyrna starting in April, and for the Altima sedan in Canton from September. </p><p class=\"\">This all comes after Nissan announced a plan in November to cut 9,000 jobs worldwide and reduce the maximum capacity of its 25 vehicle production lines as it wrestles with a sales slump in China and North America. </p><p class=\"\">    Fast Laps </p><p class=\"\">    Tesla’s fourth quarter results fell short of Wall Street expectations, but insisted it was on track to roll out new, cheaper EVs in the first half of 2025 and would start testing a paid autonomous car service in June. </p><p class=\"\">    General Motors is switching from its loss-making Cruise robotaxi unit to a future focused on its Super Cruise driver assistance technology similar to Tesla's Autopilot in the search for a profitable business model. </p><p class=\"\">    Toyota sold 10.8 million vehicles in 2024 and remained the world's top-selling automaker for the fifth consecutive year, despite a 3.7% drop in sales.  </p><p class=\"\">    Porsche's supervisory board has started talks to end chief financial officer Lutz Meschke's and sales executive Detlev von Platen's contracts early as the German luxury carmaker struggles to boost flagging earnings and weak sales in China. </p><p class=\"\">    UVeye, a startup that uses AI-driven technology to inspect vehicles to avoid defects and target repairs, said it had raised $191 million in debt and equity to scale up production in North America and Europe. </p><p class=\"\">Think your friend or colleague should know about us?

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">ELK GROVE, Calif., Feb.  04, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Accellera Systems Initiative (Accellera), the electronics industry organization focused on the creation and adoption of electronic design automation (EDA) and intellectual property (IP) standards, announced today that its Board of Directors has approved the Universal Verification Methodology for Mixed-Signal (UVM-MS) 1.0 standard for release. The new standard is available for immediate download fee free.</p><p class=\"\">The UVM-MS 1.0 standard is a comprehensive and unified analog/mixed-signal (AMS) verification methodology based on the UVM IEEE Std. 1800.2™. This standard significantly enhances the verification of AMS and digital/mixed-signal (DMS) integrated circuits and systems. It defines a robust framework that facilitates the creation of AMS verification components and testbenches by extending digital-centric UVM classes and enabling interaction between class-based and structural environments.</p><p class=\"\">“I’d like to congratulate the members of the UVM-MS Working Group for their dedication and hard work in delivering this much-anticipated standard that will significantly enhance the verification of AMS products and applications,” stated Lu Dai, Chair of Accellera. “The strong industry interest in this standard underscores its importance. As an organization devoted to improving design and verification productivity for both users and vendors, we eagerly anticipate its positive impact on the industry.”</p><p class=\"\">UVM-MS 1.0 introduces the concept of the MS Bridge, a SystemVerilog module that connects UVM agents to mixed-signal DUTs. This bridge includes an MS Proxy class, which provides an API to control the bridge core. The MS Bridge Core handles datatype conversions and signal manipulations, ensuring accurate modeling of analog behaviors. This comprehensive approach standardizes methods for driving and monitoring mixed-signal nets within UVM, significantly enhancing the productivity and quality of verification processes for AMS and DMS designs.</p><p class=\"\">“The release of UVM-MS 1.0 is a game changer for the verification of AMS designs,” said Tom Fitzpatrick, Chair of the UVM-MS Working Group. “This unified approach will help to make the verification of components and subsystems much more efficient and enable the development of reusable UVM-MS verification components, similar to Verification IP available today in UVM for digital verification. I’m deeply grateful for the hard work and collaboration of our working group members whose expertise made this achievement possible.”</p><p class=\"\">The long-term goal for the UVM-MS standard is to enhance its global reach and recognition by transitioning it to the IEEE Design Automation Standards Committee (DASC) for formal standardization. This collaboration will leverage the IEEE’s extensive global network and perspective, ensuring ongoing maintenance, greater adoption, and sustained development of the standard worldwide.</p><p class=\"\">For more information about the UVM-MS standard, visit the UVM-MS Working Group page.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Accellera</strong></p><p class=\"\">Accellera Systems Initiative is an independent, not-for-profit organization dedicated to create, support, promote and advance system-level design, modeling, and verification standards for use by the worldwide electronics industry.
