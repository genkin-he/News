Dell’s latest line-up of AI notebooks includes Neural Processor Units (NPUs), which are dedicated AI engines, to manage sustained AI and AI offload. This builds on Dell’s portfolio as the broadest GaN adapter offering for notebooks in the industry.</p><p class=\"\">The new adapters will also help Dell achieve its advanced sustainability goals, with a focus on CO2 reduction and energy reduction. The adapter cases require up to 50% less plastic and are made with post-recycled materials, significantly reducing energy waste, and improving resource utilization. Navitas’ GaNFast and GeneSiC technologies increase the level of system integration and switching frequency, which reduces the number of components, as well as the size, resulting in a ‘dematerialization’ that lowers carbon footprint throughout the production, packaging, and logistics processes. Each GaNFast power IC shipped saves 4 kg CO2 and every SiC MOSFET shipped saves 25 kg CO2 vs. legacy silicon power chips.</p><p class=\"\">“Since Dell’s first GaN adapter was enabled by Navitas back in 2020, we’ve worked closely with Dell engineering to further improve charging speed, efficiency, size, weight, and now environmental footprint,” said Gene Sheridan, CEO and co-founder of Navitas. “Dell’s new adapters are an optimal solution for speed, portability, and sustainability. Our clients achieve a win-win for both the market and environment by deploying Navitas GaNFast power ICs and GeneSiC power devices.”</p><p class=\"\">For more information on our GaNFast portfolio and charging system solutions, please contact info@navitassemi.com or visit www.navitassemi.com.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Navitas</strong></p><p class=\"\">Navitas Semiconductor  is the only pure-play, next-generation power-semiconductor company, celebrating 10 years of power innovation founded in 2014. GaNFast power ICs integrate gallium nitride (GaN) power and drive, with control, sensing, and protection to enable faster charging, higher power density, and greater energy savings.

For men with prostate cancer, PYLARIFY PET combines the accuracy of PET imaging, the precision of PSMA targeting and the clarity of an F 18 radioisotope for superior diagnostic performance. The recommended PYLARIFY dose is 333 MBq (9 mCi) with an acceptable range of 296 MBq to 370 MBq (8 mCi to 10 mCi), administered as a bolus intravenous injection.1-6</p><p class=\"\">PYLARIFY has made a profound impact on the lives of patients battling prostate cancer. It is the number one ordered PSMA PET imaging agent in the U.S., and is a proven diagnostic backed by real-world experience, including in over 400,000 scans across 48 states.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">PYLARIFY</strong><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">®</strong> <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">(piflufolastat F 18) Injection</strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Indication</strong></p><p class=\"\">PYLARIFY® (piflufolastat F 18) Injection is a radioactive diagnostic agent indicated for positron emission tomography (PET) of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positive lesions in men with prostate cancer:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">with suspected metastasis who are candidates for initial definitive therapy.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">with suspected recurrence based on elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level.</li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Important Safety Information</strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Contraindications</strong></p><p class=\"\">None.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Warnings and Precautions</strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Risk of Image Misinterpretation</strong></p><p class=\"\">Imaging interpretation errors can occur with PYLARIFY imaging. A negative image does not rule out the presence of prostate cancer and a positive image does not confirm the presence of prostate cancer. The performance of PYLARIFY for imaging of patients with biochemical evidence of recurrence of prostate cancer seems to be affected by serum PSA levels. The performance of PYLARIFY for imaging of metastatic pelvic lymph nodes prior to initial definitive therapy seems to be affected by risk factors such as Gleason score and tumor stage. PYLARIFY uptake is not specific for prostate cancer and may occur with other types of cancer as well as non-malignant processes and in normal tissues. Clinical correlation, which may include histopathological evaluation of the suspected prostate cancer site, is recommended.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Hypersensitivity Reactions</strong></p><p class=\"\">Monitor patients for hypersensitivity reactions, particularly patients with a history of allergy to other drugs and foods. Reactions may be delayed. Always have trained staff and resuscitation equipment available.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Radiation Risks</strong></p><p class=\"\">Diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, including PYLARIFY, expose patients to radiation. Radiation exposure is associated with a dose-dependent increased risk of cancer. Ensure safe handling and preparation procedures to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure. Advise patients to hydrate before and after administration and to void frequently after administration.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Adverse Reactions</strong></p><p class=\"\">The most frequently reported adverse reactions were headaches, dysgeusia and fatigue, occurring at rate of ≤2% during clinical studies with PYLARIFY.

(“Creative Medical”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company advancing regenerative medicine solutions, today announced an expanded agreement with Greenstone Biosciences Inc. (“Greenstone”) to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) in further developing its human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) platform for diabetes treatment.</p><p class=\"\">This strategic collaboration extends the progress made on Creative Medical’s proprietary hypoimmune iPSC technology, including its iPSC-derived pancreatic islet cells. These innovative cell lines, developed from Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) grade human perinatal cells, are currently being used in clinical trials. By integrating AI-driven drug discovery, the partnership aims to identify small molecules that enhance insulin secretion, further refining the therapeutic potential of Creative Medical’s hypoimmunogenic iPSC-derived pancreatic islet cells. Additionally, the program will implement multi-gene editing to develop next generation hypoimmune iPSC lines with enhanced stealth, survival, and differentiation capabilities. These advancements will not only optimize pancreatic islet cell function but also expand the platform’s applications to other regenerative therapies, addressing critical unmet medical needs.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Addressing a Major Clinical Challenge</strong></p><p class=\"\">One of the most pressing challenges in stem cell-based therapies is the requirement for immunosuppression, which can lead to severe side effects, including mortality. By refining hypoimmune iPSC lines through AI-guided development, Creative Medical is actively working to overcome these barriers, paving the way for safer and more effective cell-based treatments for diabetes and other chronic conditions.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Leadership Perspective</strong></p><p class=\"\">“Creative Medical is at the forefront of regenerative medicine, and our extended partnership with Greenstone Biosciences marks a significant milestone in our mission to develop transformative therapies,” said Timothy Warbington, President and CEO of Creative Medical.</p><p class=\"\"> “Dr. Wu and his team at Greenstone have been instrumental in validating and advancing our proprietary iPSC platform. By incorporating AI-driven methodologies, we estimate that this program will reduce R&amp;D time by approximately 50% compared to other methods and produce millions of dollars in cost savings.  We are poised to accelerate innovation, enhance therapeutic efficacy, and position ourselves as a leader in the evolving landscape of personalized medicine.” </p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Advancing Multi-Gene Edited Hypoimmune iPSCs</strong></p><p class=\"\">The next phase of development focuses on multi-gene edited hypoimmune iPSCs—cells engineered with precise modifications to evade immune detection, improve survival, and optimize therapeutic potential. These cutting-edge advancements offer the potential to eliminate the need for immunosuppression, significantly improving patient outcomes in cell-based regenerative therapies.</p><p class=\"\">As Creative Medical continues to push the boundaries of regenerative medicine, this collaboration reinforces its commitment to leveraging AI and genetic engineering to address some of the most pressing challenges in modern healthcare.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Creative Medical Technology Holdings, Inc.</strong></p><p class=\"\">Creative Medical Technology Holdings, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to developing groundbreaking regenerative therapies using stem cell and immune modulation technologies.
