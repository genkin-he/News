Its dividend was also higher than anticipated and came alongside plans to buy back up to $3 billion in shares this year, in line with expectations, Vontobel says.

The higher-than-expected net profit was mainly thanks to the Swiss group's investment bank, where revenue was well ahead of consensus expectations, RBC says. Costs came in higher than expected in some divisions, but this could be due to seasonal factors, the analysts say. UBS provided more detailed targets for the turnaround of its U.S. global-wealth-management unit, which is positive, RBC says. On the integration of Credit Suisse, it reiterated its end-2026 savings target but raised its expectations for expenses, RBC says. (adria.calatayud@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

While China just unveiled tariffs on select U.S. imports, the deadline for China's tariffs doesn't come until Feb. 10, the market analyst notes. This is keeping USD/CNH movements relatively contained, Scutt says. For now, USD/CNH's swing highs of 7.3680 in September 2023 and 7.3750 in September 2022 remain key levels for traders, he says. \"A sustained break above could open the door for an extended run higher, given the price signal it would send,\" Scutt adds. USD/CNH is 0.1% higher at 7.3181. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
