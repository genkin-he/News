Upon settlement, the Feb27s will have C$27.5bn outstanding, making it the largest free float issue in the sector. At the time of writing, CIBC said, the building roll stood around -1.1bps, versus average fair value of -1.5bps. But, the bank added, a cursory examination of the relationship between issuance and discounts to fair value suggests that rising supply was worth near 2.4bps, implying the roll \"isn't trading cheap enough.\"</p><p class=\"\">2y Sector RV: Recently, CIBC said, we've seen a clear dislocation in behaviour between Bank-owned and non-Bank-owned bonds, where the former have richened on spline during both rallies and selloffs. This, it added, is likely due to a mix of supply dynamics as well as elevated volatility. On some of CIBC's RV metrics, it finds that shorter bonds like the Feb26s and Apr26s appear cheap, while the incumbent Nov26s look rich. However, looking at the valuation of recent 2yr rolls, CIBC finds that the building roll is roughly in line with what it would expect. \"Moreover, given that we see no catalysts to drive the Nov26s/Feb27s roll richer, we think that more opportunities lie in the macro space.\"</p><p class=\"\">2yr Sector Macro: CIBC noted the past few sessions have clearly been dominated by tariff developments, with terminal rates \"whipsawing\" on new pieces of information. In CIBC's view, the market is braced for a swift resolution with very little impact. As such, it said, the balance of risk tilts to the downside, which implies richer front-end yields and a steeper 5s30s curve. However, CIBC added, an outcome that's more robust to any resolution to the conflict is the rising cost of USDs. Namely, according to CIBC, the Bank of Canada's announcement on the end of QT, in tandem with potentially lower domestic exports to the US or rising imports from the US 'should' result in a wider cross-currency basis. \"Resultingly,\" it said, \"GoC 2yr valuation to for USD investors is likely to cheapen even further from already-cheap levels, which could entice receiving flows from our southern neighbours. As such, we see some scope for further CA/US 2yr outperformance in the near term.\"</p><p class=\"\">2yr Sector Trading Thoughts: CIBC said with \"very few catalysts to support a richening of the building roll\", it sees no value in owning it coming out of tomorrow's auction. Moreover, the bank added, with few consistent signals on the broader micro, it thinks better opportunities lie in the macro. Here, CIBC sees scope for a wider cross-currency basis, which should improve the valuation of CAD duration for USD investors. Accordingly, it likes positioning for further tightening of the CA/US 2yr spread in the near term.</p></span></div>",

Initially, investors seemed to brace for economic hardship from the US President Donald Trump’s tariff war announcement. However, concerns quickly shifted to whether Bitcoin (BTC) had already peaked and was about to enter a downtrend.</p><p class=\"\">Adding to the anxiety, Bitcoin Archive noted that every past BTC bull market had topped within 330 days of breaking the prior cycle’s all-time high. Feb. 4 marks day 328. </p><p class=\"\">Yet, Bitcoin quickly rebounded after the drop. The pause on Mexico and Canada tariffs announced on Feb. 3, and President Trump’s Crypto Czar David Sacks scheduled speech on Feb. 4 seem to have reassured the market. The Fear &amp; Greed Index, which briefly dipped to 44 (fear), has since surged to 72 (greed), despite China’s announcement of retaliatory tariffs on Feb. 4. </p><p class=\"\">This raises the question of whether the market rebounded too quickly. Macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges remain, posing the risk that Bitcoin traders could be walking into a bull trap. Onchain data can offer deeper insight.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Bitcoin demand remains strong</strong></p><p class=\"\">As the tariff war scare demonstrated, Bitcoin demand remains strong, consistently absorbing pullbacks—even at historically high levels above $90,000.</p><p class=\"\">Glassnode analysis of Bitcoin’s bull market drawdowns suggests that demand for BTC could rise, possibly triggering the market’s “second euphoric phase.” Historical data shows that in the past three cycles (2011-2015, 2015-2018, and 2018-2022), corrections averaged around 25%, followed by an acceleration in price performance during the final third of the bull run.

However, an exact repeat is unlikely. In 2017, Bitcoin’s all-time high multiplied its price by 113x, while the next peak delivered a 20x return. As Bitcoin matures, each cycle’s growth ratio has declined, requiring increasingly larger capital inflows to sustain new price levels.</p><p class=\"\">So far, BTC has risen 6x from its cycle lows of $16,000 in December 2023, suggesting an expected multiplier in the range of 10x to 13x. This would mean a peak between $160,000 and $210,000—a target range that aligns with many analysts’ forecasts. VanEck’s head of digital assets research, Matthew Sigel, expects Bitcoin to hit $180,000, while Bitwise Asset Management and Bernstein anticipate $200,000.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span>UPM-Kymmene Oyj<p class=\"\">(UPM Raflatac, Mills River, 4 February 2025, at 15:00 ET) - UPM Raflatac, a global supplier of self-adhesive paper and film products, and Corning Pharmaceutical Technologies, a division of Corning Incorporated, one of the world's leading innovators in materials science, have today announced the results of a collaborative study. The results show that a combination of the two companies' products performs well in a variety of challenging drug product storage conditions and offers significant sustainability benefits for pharmaceutical industry innovators.</p><p class=\"\">Such performance is vital to the safety and integrity of pharmaceutical products and aligns with industry needs for durable and dependable packaging. In the collaborative study conducted at UPM Raflatac's North Carolina facility, teams from both companies combined pharmaceutical primary packaging and labeling solutions. The pairings were tested at room temperature, dry heat, tropical, and cryogenic storage conditions.</p><p class=\"\">The combinations included Corning® Viridian® Vials, made of externally coated Type I borosilicate glass, and UPM Raflatac's Forest Film™ labels, alongside PHARMAGLOSS and PHARMALITE downgauged paper options. The product combinations performed well, showing that a pairing of Corning and UPM Raflatac products can hold up in tough environments. In particular, the labels demonstrated satisfactory adhesion across a variety of wrap angles and storage conditions applied in pharma packaging.</p><p class=\"\">\"We greatly appreciate UPM Raflatac's expertise in label technology and its rigorous methods in demonstrating the effectiveness of labeling solutions for our shared pharma customers,\" said <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Jessica Buday</strong>, Product Line Manager for Corning® Velocity® Vials and Viridian Vials at Corning Pharmaceutical Technologies. \"This study represents an example of how important it is for pharma suppliers to collaborate and ensure our solutions are compatible in a way that meets customer requirements, particularly with the increasing demand for sustainability.\"</p><p class=\"\">The tested pairing of UPM Raflatac and Corning products provided sustainability benefits without sacrificing performance. UPM Raflatac's Forest Film™ label is the world's first ISCC-certified wood-based plastic label material. This bio-circular solution reduces the use of fossil-based plastics and is made with bio-naphtha (mass balance approach), which is derived from wood-based crude tall oil, a residue of the pulping process. This product also provides up to a 42% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to conventional fossil-based plastics.* PHARMAGLOSS and PHARMALITE downgauged paper options also reduce environmental impact through a reduced material weight. Additionally, Corning's Viridian vials use 20% less glass material than a conventional vial, achieving up to a 30% reduction in Scope 3 cradle-to-gate emissions.</p><p class=\"\">\"We're thrilled to work with Corning to help bring sustainability to the forefront of pharma packaging,\" said <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Sean Flanagan</strong>, Product Development Manager, UPM Raflatac. \"Our shared customers can trust that these solutions are safe, effective, and tested to performance standards, offering them a smoother pathway to sustainable innovation.\"</p><p class=\"\">For more insights into this collaboration, watch UPM Raflatac and Corning's recent \"Transforming Pharma Packaging\" webinar, in which representatives of the two companies discussed best practices for sustainable packaging along the value chain.</p><p class=\"\">To watch the webinar and learn more, visit https://www.upmraflatac.com/news-and-stories/events/webinars/transforming-pharma-packaging/.</p><p class=\"\">*LCA created 12/4/2024 with Label Life V3.2.

To date, this technology appears to be making some of the strongest companies, stronger, and to that end we maintained positions in many of the largest AI beneficiaries including NVIDIA, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta Platforms. This group remains a cornerstone of our portfolio, and as of year-end more than half of the portfolio’s assets are invested across the Technology Sector as a whole.

However, gold equities underperformed the gold price. Recently the rise in the gold price has not been fully reflected in the profit margins of gold mining companies. This has largely been due to cost pressures emanating from a variety of sources, exacerbated by covid. But we believe the market may be too pessimistic concerning both cost pressures which are diminishing and enhanced revenues from a higher gold price. Gold equities are inexpensive relative to their history and on an absolute basis. But a catalyst is needed to alter investor perception. This could be gold backed ETFs adding ounces reflecting a recovery in investor interest in the sector, a decline in other asset markets which may highlight gold as a portfolio diversifier, increased takeover activity or simply continued strength in the gold price. Some of our smaller gold producers such as Lundin Gold and Wesdome Gold Mines, had stellar returns. Among our larger producers Kinross and Agnico Eagle contributed significantly to performance. We continue to favor mid capitalization gold producers with good assets that trade at a big discount to some of the larger producers.”</p><p class=\"\"><em><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">The Gabelli Small Cap Growth Fund</strong></em></p><p class=\"\">We utilize our own in-house team of over 40 industry equity analysts and portfolio managers to analyze the stocks in the fund, using our bottom-up research-intensive process and, more importantly, our accumulated and compounded knowledge of selected industry sectors.

Additionally, since financial services firms are correlated to GDP, a decline in the economic environment could impact profitability.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">GGRW</strong>Securities of growth companies may be more volatile since such companies usually invest a high portion of earnings in their business, and they may lack the dividends of value stocks that can cushion stock prices in a falling market.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">GCAD</strong></p><p class=\"\">Government aerospace regulation and spending policies can significantly affect the aerospace industry because many companies involved in the aerospace industry rely to a large extent on U.S. (and other) Government demand for their products and services.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">LOPP</strong></p><p class=\"\">The application of the Adviser’s socially responsible criteria will affect the Fund’s exposure to certain issuers, industries, sectors, regions, and countries, and may impact the relative financial performance of the Fund.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Money Market Fund</strong>Investment in the fund is neither guaranteed nor insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. The fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time. You could lose money by investing in the fund.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Growth</strong>Securities of growth companies may be more volatile since such companies usually invest a high portion of earnings in their business, and they may lack the dividends of value stocks that can cushion stock prices in a falling market.</p><p class=\"\">As of December 31, 2024, GAMI and affiliates owned less than one percent of all stocks mentioned in the Growth Fund.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Gold</strong>Investments related to gold and other precious metals and minerals are considered speculative and are affected by a variety of worldwide economic, financial, and political factors. Investing in foreign securities involves risks not ordinarily associated with investment in domestic issues.

May Lose Value.</p><p class=\"\">As of December 31, 2024, GAMI and affiliates owned less than one percent of all stocks mentioned in the Gold Fund.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Small Cap</strong>Small capitalization stocks are subject to significant price fluctuations and business risks. The stocks of smaller companies may trade less frequently and experience more abrupt price movements than stocks of larger companies; therefore, investing in this sector involves special challenges.</p><p class=\"\">Returns represent past performance and do not guarantee future results.
