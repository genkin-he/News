            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">From a policy perspective, data showing New Zealand's unemployment rates at a 4-year high of 5.1% reaffirm the view that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will continue to lower rates sequentially over 1H, including another 50-basis-point cut at a policy meeting later this month, says Andrew Boak, chief economist at Goldman Sachs. Boak continues to expect the RBNZ to slow the pace of cuts to 25 basis points per meeting, starting in April, ultimately reaching a terminal official cash rate of 3.0% in July. Still, the risks are skewed to faster and deeper cuts if the recent improvement in high-frequency surveys does not translate into some improvement in the economy, he adds.

CRC-IB provides M&amp;A, project finance and   capital raising services with dedicated experience in the wind, solar,   storage, and carbon capture segments. The Agreement aims to mutually   strengthen and expand core M&amp;A, capital markets, and strategic advisory   services for the rapidly advancing global energy transition while   enhancing Canaccord Genuity's midmarket advisory capabilities, which have   materially grown since 2019. In connection with the Agreement, the   Company also made a loan to CRC HoldingCo, LLC and entered into an   agreement which will entitle the Company to acquire CRC-IB at any time up   to December 31, 2025, subject to certain conditions.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">On October 9, 2024, the Company announced that it had hired Nadine Ahn as   Deputy Chief Financial Officer and the planned successor to the current   Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Donald MacFayden, who had announced his   desire to transition from the global CFO role in 2025. Since starting   with the Company, Mr. MacFayden has been partnering with Ms. Ahn on her   transition to the global CFO role. On February 4, 2025, the board of   directors formally appointed Nadine Ahn as global CFO of the Company to   be effective from February 5, 2025.

Non-IFRS measures presented in this earnings release include certain figures from our statement of operations that are adjusted to exclude significant items. Although figures that exclude significant items provide useful information by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the Company's core operating results, a limitation of utilizing these figures that exclude significant items is that the IFRS accounting effects of these items do in fact reflect the underlying financial results of the Company's business. Accordingly, these effects should not be ignored in evaluating and analyzing the Company's financial results. Therefore, management believes that the Company's IFRS measures of financial performance and the respective non-IFRS measures should be considered together.</p><p class=\"\">Non-IFRS Measures (Adjusted Figures)</p><p class=\"\">Figures that exclude significant items provide useful information by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the Company's core operating results. Financial statement items that exclude significant items are non-IFRS measures. To calculate these non-IFRS financial statement items, we exclude certain items from our financial results prepared in accordance with IFRS. The items which have been excluded are referred to herein as significant items. The following is a description of the composition of the non-IFRS measures used in this earnings release (note that some significant items excluded may not be applicable to the calculation of the non-IFRS measure for each comparative period): (i) revenue excluding significant items, which is revenue per IFRS excluding any applicable fair value adjustments on certain illiquid or restricted marketable securities, warrants and options as recorded for IFRS reporting purposes but which are excluded for management reporting purposes and are not used by management to assess operating performance; (ii) expenses excluding significant items, are expenses per IFRS less any applicable amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination, acquisition-related expense items, which includes costs recognized in relation to both prospective and completed acquisitions, restructuring expenses, certain incentive-based costs related to the acquisitions and growth initiatives of Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management in the UK and Crown Dependencies (\"CGWM UK\") and the US and UK capital markets divisions, fair value adjustment of certain contingent consideration in connection with prior acquisitions, fair value adjustments to the derivative liability component of non-controlling interests in CGWM UK, fair value adjustments to the derivative liability component related to the convertible debentures, certain expenses related to leased premises under construction; a fair value adjustment in respect of the CGWM UK management incentive plan; and certain provisions and professional fees related to the ongoing US regulatory matters;] (iii) overhead expenses excluding significant items, which are calculated as expenses excluding significant items less compensation expense; (iv) net income before taxes after intersegment allocations and excluding significant items, which is composed of revenue excluding significant items less expenses excluding significant items; (v) income taxes (adjusted), which is composed of income taxes per IFRS adjusted to reflect the associated tax effect of the excluded significant items; (vi) net income excluding significant items, which is net income before income taxes excluding significant items less income taxes (adjusted); (vii) non-controlling interests (adjusted), which is composed of the non-controlling interests per IFRS less the amortization of the equity component of the non-controlling interests in CGWM UK and adjusted as applicable under the treasury stock method when dilutive; (viii) net income attributable to common shareholders excluding significant items, which is net income excluding significant items less non-controlling interests (adjusted) and preferred share dividends paid on the Series A and Series C Preferred Shares.</p><p class=\"\">A reconciliation of non-IFRS measures that exclude significant items to the applicable IFRS measures from the interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 can be found above in the table entitled \"Summary of results for Q3 fiscal 2025 and year-to-date fiscal 2025 and selected financial information excluding significant items\".</p><p class=\"\">Non-IFRS Ratios</p><p class=\"\">Non-IFRS ratios are calculated using the non-IFRS measures defined above. For the periods presented herein, we have used the following non-IFRS ratios: (i) total expenses excluding significant items as a percentage of revenue, which is calculated by dividing expenses excluding significant items by revenue excluding significant items; (ii) earnings per common share excluding significant items, which is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders excluding significant items by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (basic); (iii) diluted earnings per common share excluding significant items which is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders excluding significant items by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (diluted); and (iv) pre-tax profit margin which is calculated by dividing net income before taxes excluding significant items by revenue excluding significant items.</p><p class=\"\">Supplementary Financial Measures</p><p class=\"\">Client assets are supplementary financial measures that do not have any definitions prescribed under IFRS but do not meet the definition of a non-IFRS measure or non-IFRS ratio. Client assets, which include both assets under management (AUM) and assets under administration (AUA), is a measure that is common to the wealth management business. Client assets is the market value of client assets managed and administered by the Company from which the Company earns commissions and fees. This measure includes funds held in client accounts as well as the aggregate market value of long and short security positions. The Company's method of calculating client assets may differ from the methods used by other companies, and therefore these measures may not be comparable to other companies.
