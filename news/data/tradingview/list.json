Analysts had forecast revenue of 11.85 billion kroner, according to company-compiled consensus.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Singapore's retail sales will likely pick up this year, says OCBC's Selena Ling. Retail sales contracted 2.9% on year in December, marking its worst performance since February 2022, she writes. But with the Singapore Tourism Board expecting 17 million-18.5 million visitors this year that could generate S$29 billion to S$30.5 billion in revenue, things look brighter for the retail sector. Domestic consumption is also expected to be supported by a resilient labor market, Ling says. However, she cautions that external headwinds pose as a key risk for the retail sector, and a challenging trade environment may dampen near-term market sentiment. OCBC expects Singapore's retail sales to expand around 2% in 2025 compared to 2024's 1.2% and 2023's 2.3%.(amanda.lee@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

The Irish research firm forecasts that DCC could receive 1.365 billion pounds for the division. This is more than 15 times the FY 2025 Ebitda expectations of 88 million pounds, the analyst adds in a note. Assuming that most of the cash will be returned to shareholders, this means that the disposal will unlock significant value as the deal could be far ahead of DCC's current valuation, Grant adds. DCC said in its third-quarter update that the disposal is progressing in line with expectations, the analyst says. Shares are down 2.4% at 53.65 pounds. (michael.susin@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

The Canadian dollar could rise further if tariff risks are entirely priced out, he says. There is a residual 1% risk premium embedded into USD/CAD. \"That said, we are not sure markets will or should move to a completely optimistic stance on the U.S.-Canada trade spat.\" There are no clear hints Canada will be spared from another round of potential universal tariffs.

(miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0822 GMT - The euro's gains will likely prove limited as it remains broadly unattractive given weak macroeconomic fundamentals and President Trump's threats to impose tariffs on the EU, ING analyst Francesco Pesole says. Wide eurozone-U.S. interest rate differentials in favor of the dollar reflect these factors, he says in a note. Trade news will dominate euro price action, although it will be interesting to hear whether the unexpected acceleration in January eurozone inflation triggers some change in the narrative from European Central Bank members. The ECB's chief economist, Philip Lane, is due to speak at 1400 GMT in Washington, DC. The euro rises 0.2% to $1.0402. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0811 GMT - Singapore's retail sales could strengthen this year after a soft performance in 2024, buoyed by new attractions and other tailwinds, UOB associate economist Jester Koh writes in a note. Retail sales fell again in December due to weak tourist arrival numbers. For the full year, retail sales growth fell to 1.2% from 2.3% in 2023, with eight of 14 retail sales categories declining, he notes. Looking ahead, he expects new attractions, including Singapore's fifth zoological park, to lend support to sales. The upcoming budget 2025 is likely to be expansionary and further support measures could also lift sales, he adds. (amanda.lee@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0803 GMT - The 10-year French-Spanish government bond yield spread is gradually nearing the 5 basis point threshold, signalling improving sentiment over France, Natixis analysts say in a note. The spread hasn't reached this level since last November, they say, describing it \"a sign that investor perception of France is less pessimistic than before.\" The 10-year French-Spanish yield differential is 5.6 basis points, according to LSEG data. French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou used special executive powers on Monday to push the 2025 budget through parliament without a vote, while facing a no-confidence motion on Wednesday.

Openings dropped to 7.6 million from 8.2 million in November. The data hints at less pressure on wage growth and potentially more supportive Federal Reserve policy, Swissquote Bank analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya says in a note. Traders will now turn their focus to U.S. ADP private payrolls data at 1315 GMT and the U.S. ISM services report at 1500 GMT.

Preliminary data show the country's box office sales exceeded 9 billion yuan during the Lunar New Year holiday, while domestic travel reached a new record of over 2.33 billion cross-regional trips within China, they say. These are positive signs for consumer sentiment, but HSBC remains cautious over whether the holiday spirit can translate into more sustainable momentum without further stimulus. Another fiscal policy push is still needed to drive a sustained increase in activities in the coming months, especially given geopolitical uncertainty, HSBC adds. (jiahui.huang@wsj.com; @ivy_jiahuihuang)</p><p class=\"\">0754 GMT - Citi expects Malaysia's minimum wage hike to boost consumer spending, with median wages projected to grow by a high single digit in 2025, analyst Huan Wen Gan writes in a note. The minimum wage was raised to MYR1,700/month from MYR1,500/month on Feb. 1. Retail trade, particularly at convenience stores and mini-markets, is likely see further support, he adds. The agriculture sector has lower median wages, but oil palm harvesters already earn above the new threshold, minimizing the impact on palm oil players, he reckons. Mr. D.I.Y. Group (M) may face higher labor costs, with an 8% wage hike factored into 2025 earnings estimates, he says. For every 1% increase in wages could result in a 0.8% cut in its 2025 net profit forecast, he adds. Given stronger consumption trends and stable earnings potential, Citi remains positive on Malaysia's consumer sector. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0732 GMT - German Bunds are running into resistance ahead of the yield lows of the year, but shaky risk sentiment and a sanguine European Central Bank wage tracker should keep the momentum going, says Commerzbank Research's Michael Leister. \"With the ongoing focus on trade wars and fragile risk sentiment we expect Bunds to stay bid,\" the head of interest rates strategy says in a note. That said, the air is getting thinner for Bunds as yields are approaching the lows recorded in the initial sessions of the year, Leister says. In addition, risk-off once again turns out to not be self-reinforcing, with equities stuck at the highs, he says. The 10-year German Bund yield falls 2.5 basis points to 2.374%, tracking U.S. Treasury yields lower, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0730 GMT - Limiting the downside risks for Chinese markets and the yuan depend on the potential of fresh talks between the U.S. and China, writes Mansoor Mohi-uddin, chief economist at Bank of Singapore. Financial markets on Tuesday had a muted reaction to China's retaliatory tariffs of 10%-15% on select U.S. goods, but there's a chance of a stronger reaction down the line if negotiations don't see results, Mohi-uddin says. Should U.S. tariffs on China remain at 10% this year, the impact should be manageable, he notes, adding that the measures will trim about 0.5% from China's GDP growth this year from its 5.0% rate in 2024. However, should the tariffs be raised to 20%-30%, growth may fall closer to 4.0%, Mohi-uddin estimates.

The Nikkei Stock Average rose 0.1% to 38831.48. Investors are focusing on U.S. tariff-related developments as well as earnings. USD/JPY is at 153.16, compared with 154.34 as of Tuesday 5 p.m. Eastern time. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield rises one basis point to 1.285%. (kosaku.narioka@wsj.com; @kosakunarioka)</p><p class=\"\">0717 GMT - The yuan may still face more downward pressure, Maybank's FX analysts say in a research report. \"China remains the only country that President Trump has allowed tariff to take effect on,\" the analysts say. \"Notwithstanding the fact that his trade policies and end goals remain murky at this stage, the developments thus far suggest that China is still taking the brunt of his trade policies,\" the analysts say. Taking into account the tariffs' deadlines, a scenario of an impasse on U.S.-China negotiations would probably prompt the PBOC to \"relent\" on USD/CNY fixings and allow USD/CNY to trend higher, the analysts add. USD/CNH is little changed at 7.2861. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
