            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span>aXichem AB<p class=\"\">aXichem AB (publ), developer of innovative natural analogue feed additives and dietary supplement ingredients, announces that the company will increase the number of studies, regarding effect, that form part of the documentation for supplementing aXichem's application for Feed Additive approval in the EU for the company's product phenylcapsaicin as a salmonella-inhibiting additive in chicken feed. The company will conduct one additional effect study and assesses, based on previous positive effect data, that this is the only remaining part for a complete application. The extended studies affect the estimated time of submission to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which the company announced in connection with the presentation of the quarterly report on November 29, 2024.</p><p class=\"\">Torsten Helsing, CEO, comments:</p><p class=\"\">“We have conducted three studies in a clinical environment where chickens were exposed to salmonella at a level that is higher compared to what is seen in an industrial production environment. EFSA's regulations require three studies that demonstrate the product's effect in the use for which the application is intended. Two of the studies show that phenylcapsaicin has a statistically significant salmonella-inhibiting effect, which is very positive. However, study three has given us results that we do not believe meet the criteria for a complete application. Our assessment after analysis is that no changes in the study set up are required, but other factors may have played a role for the study result. We will therefore repeat the study, which will take place as soon as the test facility we have chosen makes it possible. This means that we can submit the additions to EFSA at the earliest when the study has been completed and compiled, and the result contains the data we need for the application. We will notify the market as soon as this happens.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About phenylcapsaicin and aXiphen</strong></p><p class=\"\">The health benefits of chili, with its active ingredient capsaicin have been known for centuries. aXichem’s proprietary molecule, phenylcapsaicin, combines the naturally occurring phenyl group with capsaicin, bridged by a triple bond. The result is an innovative natural analogue capsaicin with high purity, where the pungency is greatly reduced.</p><p class=\"\">Production tests and studies have proven the effectiveness of aXiphen® as an ingredient in poultry feed. A production test on on-floor salmonella prevalence, following the inclusion of 15 ppm phenylcapsaicin in a regular starter diet, was carried out in a full-scale commercial broiler production trial under farming conditions. The production test included about 1.6 million broiler chickens. The trial concluded that under the conditions of the test, the inclusion of 15 ppm phenylcapsaicin in broiler chicken feed statistically significantly reduced the number of farms with salmonella-positive floor boot swabs. The European model for production efficiency, EPEF, showed that breeding efficiency increased by 14% compared to traditional feeding.</p><p class=\"\">The information was submitted, through the care of the contact person below, for publication on 4 February 2025, at 17:45 CET.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Company contact:</strong></p><p class=\"\">Torsten Helsing, CEO, aXichem AB</p><p class=\"\">Phone: +46 706 863 355 Email: torsten.helsing@axichem.com</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About aXichem</strong></p><p class=\"\">aXichem develops, patents and markets natural analogue industrial chemicals, i.e., synthetically produced substances that have similar and comparable properties to natural substances.

(denny.jacob@wsj.com; @pennedbyden)</p><p class=\"\">1001 ET - The average buyer's agent commission held steady at 2.37% in 4Q, down slightly from 2.45% a year prior, according to Redfin. Despite new commission rules by the National Association of Realtors implemented in August 2024, commissions saw only minor fluctuations, starting at 2.38% in July, dipping to 2.35% in August, and returning to 2.38% by December. A Redfin survey of 500 U.S. agents revealed that 48% said the average agent commission in their area remained about the same since the NAR settlement took effect, while 43% noted a decline. Moreover, 54% of agents reported increased negotiation efforts over commissions by clients, with only 6% seeing less negotiation. (chris.wack@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0928 ET - New U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods were met with retaliation from China, resulting in selling in CBOT soybean futures overnight. But that selling has moderated, with the most-active soybean contract now down only 0.3% pre-market. Traders who have spoken to WSJ say that a lot of market activity has become reactive to new headlines, but is showing restraint in light of trade uncertainty. \"I think the trade is well braced for this,\" says Terry Reilly of Marex. Reilly adds that many traders likely \"learned their lesson\" after handling the fallout of the trade war with China in Trump's first term. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0922 ET - The dollar recovers some ground after yesterday's choppy session, which ended with a small decline in the WSJ Dollar Index as tariffs on Mexico and Canada were delayed. The trade war with China goes on and markets remain worried about the potential fallout of a prolonged period in which tariffs would loom over the global economy. BBH says in a report that investors should look through the noise and focus on the fact that the U.S. still has strong growth and elevated inflation, \"and a more hawkish Fed continues to favor higher U.S. yields and a stronger dollar.\" The greenback strengthens 0.3 against the yen and is stable versus the euro. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)</p><p class=\"\">0918 ET - Much of the past few days has been about gauging how inflexible the Trump administration will be on tariffs; in other words, whether they're better understood as firm policy or a negotiating tool. Quick postponements of the Canada and Mexico tariffs point to the latter category, strategist Will Compernolle of FHN Financial writes. He notes China's retaliatory tariffs against the only barriers Trump has actually implemented so far don't start until Feb. 10. That \"implies room for negotiation, something traders may take as a sign these tariffs will not be long term,\" Compernolle writes. \"The trade relationship may nevertheless be scarred, but there's a sense, rightly or wrongly, the more maximalist policies will not be the equilibrium.\" (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Matt Grossman</p><p class=\"\">The U.S. job market is still solid. But more workers are staying put, because the chance to trade up to a better job is rarer.</p><p class=\"\">Americans quit 39.6 million jobs in 2024, down 11% from the year before and down 22% from a recent peak in 2022, according to Labor Department data published Tuesday. The share of employees who quit their jobs each month has fallen below the prepandemic level, and some economists expect more decreases ahead.</p><p class=\"\">It wasn't long ago that a revved-up U.S. labor market kicked off a frenzy of job switching. People jostled for better pay, better perks and more flexibility. Businesses obliged, since they were eager for workers as the economy reopened from the pandemic. The supercharged effect of the pandemic largely wore off this past summer, ending the hottest job market in a generation.</p><p class=\"\">Unemployment remains modest and the economy is still creating jobs. Layoffs are limited. The Labor Department will release its latest monthly jobs report on Friday, and economists expect another month of decent job growth and a steady unemployment rate at 4.1%.</p><p class=\"\">But there are now just 1.1 job openings per unemployed worker, down from a high of 2 in March 2022. For workers who do get laid off or who want a new role, the path to an offer is far more challenging.</p><p class=\"\">\"It's not immediately clear to me what's going to turn this around,\" said Neil Dutta, an economist at research firm Renaissance Macro.</p><p class=\"\">Hiring, along with quitting, has slowed, too. The share of workers hired into new jobs every month fell to an average of 3.5% in 2024, a decline from a recent peak of about 4.4% in 2021. Last year, Americans heard \"you're hired\" about 66 million times, down from 71 million in 2023. In the Conference Board's latest monthly survey released last week, far fewer people are now saying that jobs are plentiful compared with during the early 2020s. More complain they are hard to get.</p><p class=\"\">Workers in well-paid office jobs are encountering an especially challenging job market. Companies in tech, law and related industries hired fast a few years ago, and many now have less need for new employees. There are still plenty of jobs in hands-on industries such as healthcare and hospitality.</p><p class=\"\">\"The past 18 to 24 months have been just more of a steady malaise\" for top-level white-collar jobs, said Michael Distefano, chief executive of Korn Ferry's professional-search business. He said the office-job market has shown signs of picking up in 2025, but it will depend on whether Trump administration policies encourage business investment, and how the Federal Reserve sets monetary policy.</p><p class=\"\">The Fed's quest to tame inflation through high interest rates works in part by discouraging too much investment and hiring, because a hot job market can in turn lift wages and raise prices. The Fed paused further rate cuts last week with inflation still modestly above target, and traders are betting that the central bank might not bring rates lower again until June.</p><p class=\"\">As the race for talent has cooled, companies are more focused on controlling salary costs.</p><p class=\"\">Meta plans to cut 5% of its workforce this month. Its finance chief, Susan Li, told analysts last week that while the tech giant is still adding technical talent, it has eased off hiring business staff. RTX, the defense contractor formerly known as Raytheon, is investing in automation \"that will continue to drive productivity without the need to add head count,\" its CEO, Christopher Calio, said on the company's earnings call last week.</p><p class=\"\">What happens next depends on how well companies can keep a lid on costs without turning to layoffs — which have stayed at a low level after spiking early in the pandemic.</p><p class=\"\">\"This labor market has shown that it can keep cooling for a long time without things breaking,\" said Guy Berger, an economist at the Burning Glass Institute, an employment think tank. \"Forever? Probably not, but maybe there's more room for the labor market to cool in a mostly painless way.\"</p><p class=\"\">Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com</p></span></div>",
