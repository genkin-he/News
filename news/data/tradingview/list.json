Trump's comments revived hopes for a pause in U.S. tariffs on China, similar to the situation with Canada and Mexico, according to the director of FX Strategy. However, with mainland China still closed for holiday today, the USD/CNY fixing guidance on Wednesday will be closely monitored, Cheung adds. USD/CNH is little changed at 7.3114.

However, some crypto analysts see this sharp decline as a buying opportunity, suggesting that BTC may be oversold and poised for a rebound.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Is Bitcoin Poised For A Relief Rally?</strong></p><p class=\"\">Yesterday, the crypto market experienced one of its largest sell-offs in history, with over $2.3 billion in liquidations affecting more than 742,000 traders. This level of liquidations surpasses those seen during the COVID market crash in March 2020 and the FTX collapse in November 2022.</p><p class=\"\">Despite the downturn, some analysts argue that BTC may have entered oversold territory, signaling a potential relief rally. Crypto analyst Caleb Franzen shared insights in a post on X, highlighting that Bitcoin’s 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped into oversold levels. He noted:</p><div class=\"blockquote-xrkxvh37\"><p class=\"\">For the 5th time since August 2024, Bitcoin’s 4-hour RSI is becoming oversold. Each of the prior signals were attractive accumulation periods, even if price made new short-term lows after the signal flashed.</p></div><p class=\"\">For the uninitiated, the RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes to determine whether BTC is overbought or oversold. A reading above 70 suggests overbought conditions – potential for a pullback – while a reading below 30 indicates oversold conditions – potential for a rebound.</p><p class=\"\">According to Franzen’s chart, Bitcoin’s current RSI is hovering around 24 on the 4-hour timeframe, indicating that BTC may be in an attractive accumulation zone.

Renowned businessman and author Robert Kiyosaki warns that BTC could face further downside pressure if Trump follows through with his tariff plans. </p><p class=\"\">According to Kiyosaki, increased tariffs could strengthen the US dollar, potentially driving investors away from risk assets like Bitcoin in the short term.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Australia's core inflation remains high and the economy is fully employed, but global risks should make the Reserve Bank of Australia more dovish, say economists at HSBC Global Research. The escalation of trade tensions creates downside risk for the global economy and the scale and breadth of tariffs on products and countries suggest the impact is likely to be significant, say Paul Bloxham and Jamie Culling in a note. They reckon this is enough to tip the RBA's view to start supporting the economy a little earlier than expected. HSBC now sees the RBA cutting its cash rate by 25 bps this month, with another cut expected in 3Q and a final cut in the current cycle in 1Q 2026. (monica.gupta@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
