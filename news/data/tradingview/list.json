This left investment funds, job creation, and donations towards cultural and research initiatives as the only remaining program options.</p><p class=\"\">And of the remaining choices, the Research Golden Visa track –<em> requiring a donation of at least </em><em>€</em><em>500,000</em> – has been the most frequently overlooked.</p><p class=\"\">This is all set to change in 2025, thanks to the launch of a groundbreaking new <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Research Golden Visa</strong> product by <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Visadoro</strong>, a Portuguese investment migration firm based out of Belmonte, Portugal.</p><p class=\"\">Collaborating with a prestigious Portuguese research institution, Visadoro has developed a Golden Visa eligible donation product that also serves as a cutting-edge cancer cover.</p><p class=\"\">Philanthropic donors making a minimum investment of €750,000 towards next-gen cancer research projects in Portugal can qualify for the Portuguese Golden Visa. Golden Visa holders qualify for a flexible “Plan B” type residency in Portugal, whereby they gain the <em>right</em> to live in Portugal full-time, without the <em>obligation to do so. </em></p><p class=\"\">This type of residency also offers a clear path to Permanent Residency (PR), and eventual Portuguese citizenship – with a minimum <!-- -->in-country presence requirement of only 7 days per year during the 5-year Temporary Residency stage.</p><p class=\"\">In addition, applicants participating in this program can also benefit from free cutting-edge cancer treatment in the event that they were to be diagnosed with cancer themselves.</p><p class=\"\">Moreover, the treatment cover can be extended to the primary donor’s spouse and up to two dependents over the age of 18, subject to additional financial contributions per dependent:</p><p class=\"\">To extend treatment coverage for a spouse, an additional contribution of €250,000 is required (i.e. €1 million in total). The minimum program contribution for a family of 3 is €1.5 million, and €2 million for a family of 4.</p><p class=\"\"><em>(</em><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><em>Note: </em></strong>the institution does not offer paediatric cancer treatment, however, minor dependents can be added as beneficiaries, and become eligible for treatment once they turn 18).</p><p class=\"\">In countries like the United States, gaining access to cutting-edge cancer treatments can literally cost millions of dollars, making the program’s benefits exceptionally attractive in terms of value for money.</p><p class=\"\">So for philanthropists already supporting oncology research, this program is a true no-brainer.</p><p class=\"\">The providers of conventional cancer insurance products typically run on a for-profit basis. Hence, pre-screening tends to be a prerequisite for obtaining cover, and care tends to be refused for applicants with pre-existing conditions.</p><p class=\"\">Not so in this instance: the collaborating research foundation actively encourages applications from individuals who could benefit.</p><p class=\"\">Hence, <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">there are no pre-screening tests, and</strong> <!-- -->you cannot be precluded from program participation based on the fact that you’ve already been diagnosed with cancer.</p><p class=\"\">The institution’s research facilities are complemented by top-tier treatment facilities, where patients can look forward to a best-in-class treatment and care experience in the spectacular city of Lisbon.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Portuguese Golden Visas, Redefined For Good</strong></p><p class=\"\">In the past, the Golden Visa Program has drawn criticism based on allegations that foreign direct investments only benefited the real estate sector, and didn’t have a broad-based socio-economic impact.</p><p class=\"\">In contrast, contributions under the Cancer Research Golden Visa Program help to position Portugal at the forefront of global cancer research. It enables researchers to radically reduce the time it takes to take new medicines and treatment technologies from laboratory to bedside.</p><p class=\"\">And ultimately, it will serve to bring life-saving treatments to a far greater number of patients in need, both in Portugal and beyond.</p><p class=\"\">In the past, some Golden Visa applicants have also been accused of wanting to gain access to Portugal without integrating into the country, or making a valuable contribution to the public good.</p><p class=\"\">It is for precisely for this reason that Visadoro and its research partners developed this Golden Visa product; <!-- -->to attract visionary philanthropists who want to make a high-impact socio-economic contribution to their new home country.</p><p class=\"\">For these individuals, the program contribution is not a box-ticking exercise. Instead, they are societally conscious agents of change, seeking to put their wealth to work towards building a brighter future; both for their children, and for humanity as whole.</p><p class=\"\">Annually, global philanthropic giving towards cancer research is already a multi-billion-dollar sector.</p><p class=\"\">And now, thanks to this <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">innovative</strong> <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Cancer Research Golden Visa</strong> product, donors in this sector can gain cutting-edge cancer treatment cover, in addition to the knowledge that they’re leaving the world in a better state than they found it in.</p><p class=\"\">The research foundation actively fosters deep relationships with their donors, and invites interested parties to pay a visit to their world-class facilities in Lisbon.</p><p class=\"\">According to Jose Mineiro, founder and CEO of Visadoro, the Cancer Research Golden Visa program is a logical extension of his company’s ethos of putting the Golden Visa program to work for the good of Portugal and its people.</p><p class=\"\">Visadoro are also involved in various developmental initiatives seeking to drive more direct investment and resource allocation in the Portuguese interior.</p><p class=\"\">Interested parties are invited to get in touch with the team at Visadoro at the below contact details.</p><p class=\"\">Alternatively, for more information,<strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"> Google “Cancer Research Golden Visa”</strong>, or visit <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">www.ResearchGoldenVisa.com</strong>.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">ISSUED BY:</strong></p><p class=\"\">VISADORO – VISAS WITH A PURPOSE</p><p class=\"\">Rua Pedro Alvares Cabral, 11</p><p class=\"\">Belmonte</p><p class=\"\">Portugal</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">WhatsApp:</strong> +351918196577</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Email: </strong>hello@visadoro.com</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Web: </strong>www.visadoro.com</p><p class=\"\">A photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/42a6b538-77c0-4238-81eb-f26332ab4a4e</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">New Cancer Research Golden Visa Option Launched</strong></p> <!-- --> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">The Cancer Research Golden Visa option is ideal for visionary philanthropists already supporting cancer research initiatives.</strong></p></span></div>",

Lexaria had previouslyreported it had received HRECapproval for the lead clinical site, and that it also had completedall clinical test article manufacturing.</p><p class=\"\">“Lexaria thanks its regulatory and clinical team fortheir efforts to complete these milestones,” said John Docherty,President and Chief Scientific Officer of Lexaria Bioscience Corp.“We are especially excited about the prospect of adding the5thArm to this Study following the results of ourHuman Pilot Study #3 which not only showed comparability in terms ofboth blood glucose reduction and increased levels of insulin butalso a significant reduction in adverse eventsrelated to the oral administration of Eli Lilly’s Zepbound®, onceprocessed with our proprietary DehydraTECH™ technology.”</p><p class=\"\">About The Study</p><p class=\"\">The Study is underway with 20 overweight, obese, pre-or type 2 diabetic patients for each of Study Arms 1-4, with Study Arm5 to test DehydraTECH-processed pure tirzepatide.  The 5th Arm is in theprocess of being added because of the previously announced positiveresults from Lexaria’s separate study Human Pilot Study#3. All drugs will be administereddaily by oral tablet or capsule – there are no drug injectionsinvolved in this Study as Lexaria is promoting a change in thestandard of care away from injections and instead embracing oralDehydraTECH delivery. </p><p class=\"\">Arm 1 of the Study is utilizing a proprietary, patentedDehydraTECH-CBD formulation.

Also, inrodent study work reported in October2024, Lexaria was pleased to seecomparable performance of DehydraTECH-semaglutide without SNAC toDehydraTECH-processed Rybelsus® formulations including SNAC; whichLexaria previouslyreported may be due to DehydraTECHpreserving similar molecular properties in the gut for ingestedsemaglutide which has been shown to be integral to SNAC-enabledsemaglutide gut absorption.     </p><p class=\"\">Lexaria has several important objectives for thisStudy:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\">Is DehydraTECH processed: CBD, semaglutide, and/ortirzepatide safe over the Study duration in the Studypopulation? </p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\">Does DehydraTECH-(pure) semaglutide outperformRybelsus®-semaglutide with its proprietary SNAC technology inmeasures of blood sugar control or weight loss? </p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\">Does DehydraTECH processing enhance real world outcomessuch as weight loss and blood sugar control over the Studyduration? </p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\">Does DehydraTECH processing of pure semaglutideevidence reduced side effects during daily dosing for 12 weeks, asDehydraTECH processing of Rybelsus® seemed to achieve in a prior humanstudy utilizing one single dailydose? </p></li></ul><p class=\"\">About Lexaria Bioscience Corp. &amp;DehydraTECH</p><p class=\"\">DehydraTECH™ is Lexaria’s patented drug deliveryformulation and processing platform technology which improves the wayactive pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) enter the bloodstream throughoral delivery.

We are excited to share that in the last quarter, we achieved a 3% top-line growth while delivering €11.1 million in Adjusted EBITDA, both exceeding our expectations. Our brand investments are paying off, demonstrated by continued positive brand revenue trajectory. Looking ahead to 2025 and beyond, we are well positioned for growth which we can already see with strong double-digit revenue growth in January,\" said Chief Executive Officer Johannes Thomas.</p><p class=\"\">\"Our robust financial performance in the fourth quarter and the excellent start to the year are very encouraging. Both the fourth quarter of 2024 and January 2025 exceeded our expectations. With a return to revenue growth, a strong cash balance of over €130 million at the end of 2024, no long-term debt, and a healthy Adjusted EBITDA margin1 of around 10% over the last two quarters, we have successfully returned to a profitable growth trajectory.

We are focused on reshaping the way travelers search for and compare different types of accommodations, such as hotels, vacation rentals and apartments, while enabling our advertisers to grow their businesses by providing them with access to a broad audience of travelers via our websites and apps. Our platform allows travelers to make informed decisions by personalizing their search for accommodations and providing them with access to a deep supply of relevant information and prices. As of December 31, 2024, we offered access to more than 5.0 million hotels and other types of accommodation in over 190 countries, including over 3.8 million units of alternative accommodation, such as vacation rentals and apartments. Our search platform forms the core of our user experience and can be accessed globally via 53 localized websites and apps available in 31 languages.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Discussion of Results</strong></p><p class=\"\">The discussion of results should be considered together with our unaudited financial information included with this review and the periodic reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Certain information and disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) have been omitted from this review. The unaudited information included with this review is derived from our preliminary internal financial reports and is subject to revision based on the completion of our year-end processes necessary to finalize our audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Recent Trends</strong></p><p class=\"\">Total revenues grew by 3% to €94.8 million in the fourth quarter, compared to the same prior year period, primarily driven by the 5% growth in Referral Revenue. We believe the return to year-over-year growth represents a turning point in our strategic multi-year efforts to rejuvenate the brand and achieve our goal of double-digit revenue growth in the medium-term as previously announced. Our strategic focus on rebuilding the brand has been critical to achieving these results. Net income and Adjusted EBITDA grew by 104% to €5.1 million, and by 52% to €11.1 million, respectively, compared to the same prior year period, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter.</p><p class=\"\">Investments in our branded channel traffic2 across all three reporting segments have fueled the growth during the quarter. These investments assisted us in reaching a larger audience, resulting in a strengthened branded baseline that we believe will have a long-term positive impact. In late December 2024, we launched our new global marketing campaigns featuring our Brand Ambassador, Jürgen Klopp. These campaigns have resonated well with audiences in key launch markets, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, which we believe has benefited our brand during the fourth quarter of 2024 and will continue into 2025.</p><p class=\"\">Referral Revenue grew year-over-year in our Americas and Rest of World segments. In Americas, we observed healthy levels of growth in monetization as compared to the third quarter of 2024 and the fourth quarter of the prior year. In Rest of World, higher branded channel traffic volumes and better booking conversion more than offset the slightly softer monetization for the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year (though monetization in Rest of World showed positive improvements over the course of the fourth quarter). We observed softer monetization in Developed Europe as compared to the same prior year quarter. Referral Revenue in Developed Europe declined 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, continuing the trend of sequential improvement seen throughout the second half of the year, driven by increased branded channel traffic in response to our brand marketing investments.</p><p class=\"\">In conjunction with our revenue growth, operating expenses of €87.0 million remained relatively stable compared to €87.3 million in the same prior year quarter. Operating expenses excluding Advertising Spend of €57.4 million (2023: €57.2 million), decreased by 2% compared to the same prior year period, demonstrating the successful execution of our strategic objective to deliver revenue growth while exercising operational discipline.</p><p class=\"\">_____________________</p><p class=\"\">2 Branded channel traffic refers to traffic to our platform through: one of our localized platform websites, one of our downloadable mobile applications, branded search engine optimization marketing channels (or \"branded free traffic\") for keyword searches that are inclusive of the trivago brand name, and/or paid keyword searches that include the trivago brand name, such as \"trivago\" or \"trivago hotel\".</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Outlook</strong></p><p class=\"\">During the first weeks of 2025, we have observed strong double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in all three reporting segments. We are encouraged by the strong start to the new year, which has exceeded our expectations. We believe the performance marketing channel3 headwinds observed in prior quarters have largely subsided over the course of 2024 and anticipate this will reduce volatility in our upcoming earnings.</p><p class=\"\">Our total Advertising Spend remains at a fraction of historical levels, which we believe highlights the significant upside potential that remains of further increasing our global marketing efforts. We plan to continue pursuing our strategy of prioritizing investing in our brand over short-term profit maximization and to take an opportunity-driven approach to investing, focusing on investments that we believe will deliver long-term benefits. We expect to continue re-investing our profits into our marketing strategy, including further increasing our Advertising Spend in the upcoming year to maintain the positive momentum we have seen so far. We believe trivago is well-positioned, well-capitalized, and ready to sustain its growth trajectory. As a result, for the full year 2025, we expect total revenues to grow by at least high single-digit percentage levels compared to the same period in 2024, and to achieve at least breakeven Adjusted EBITDA levels for the full year-ending 2025.</p><p class=\"\">Revenue, Advertising Spend, and Return of Advertising Spend</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Referral Revenue &amp; Other Revenue</strong></p><p class=\"\">We match our users’ searches with large numbers of hotel and other accommodation offers through our auction platform, which we call our marketplace. With our marketplace, we provide advertisers a competitive forum to access user traffic by facilitating a vast quantity of auctions on any particular day. Advertisers submit hotel room and other accommodation rates and participate in our marketplace primarily by making bids for each user click on an advertised rate for a hotel or other accommodation on a cost-per-click, or CPC, basis. We also offer the option for our advertisers to participate in our marketplace on a cost-per-acquisition, or CPA, basis.</p><p class=\"\">We earn substantially all of our revenue when users of our websites and apps click on hotel and accommodation offers or advertisements in our search results and are referred to one of our advertisers, or when a user makes a booking on the advertiser's website ultimately from a referral from our platform. We call this our Referral Revenue.</p><p class=\"\">_____________________</p><p class=\"\">3 Performance marketing channel traffic refers to traffic to our platform that is acquired for our website by purchasing certain keywords (excluding keyword combinations inclusive of the trivago brand name) from general search engines (referred to as “search engine marketing”), such as Google or Yahoo!, and through advertisements on other online marketing channels such as advertising networks, social media sites, and affiliate websites.</p><p class=\"\">Management has identified three reportable segments: Americas, Developed Europe and Rest of World (RoW). Our Americas segment is comprised of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, the United States and Uruguay. Our Developed Europe segment is comprised of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Our RoW segment is comprised of all other countries. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the most significant countries by revenue in that segment were Japan, Australia, Turkey, New Zealand, and India. We have also determined that our equity method investment in Holisto Limited has met the criteria for an operating segment, however, it does not meet the quantitative thresholds of a separate reportable segment.</p><p class=\"\">We also earn revenue by offering our advertisers business-to-business (B2B) solutions such as data product offerings and subscription fees earned from advertisers for the trivago Business Studio subscriptions. These revenue streams do not represent a significant portion of our total revenue.</p><p class=\"\">Referral Revenue by Segment &amp; Other Revenue (€ millions)</p><div class=\"tableWrapper-pIO_GYwT\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td>     </td><td colspan=\"7\">   Three months ended December 31,   </td><td colspan=\"7\">   Twelve months ended December 31,   </td></tr><tr><td>     </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2024  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2023  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  Δ €  </td><td>  Δ %  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2024  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2023  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  Δ €  </td><td>  Δ % Y/Y  </td></tr><tr><td>  Americas  </td><td>  €  </td><td>  36.0  </td><td>  €  </td><td>  33.3  </td><td>  €  </td><td>  2.7  </td><td>  8%  </td><td>  €  </td><td>  173.6  </td><td>  €  </td><td>  176.4  </td><td>  €  </td><td>  (2.8)  </td><td>  (2)%  </td></tr><tr><td>  Developed Europe  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  37.0  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  37.6  </td><td>     </td><td>  (0.6)  </td><td>  (2)%  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  192.1  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  215.7  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (23.6)  </td><td>  (11)%  </td></tr><tr><td>  Rest of World  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  20.5  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  17.9  </td><td>     </td><td>  2.6  </td><td>  15%  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  90.5  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  84.7  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  5.8  </td><td>  7%  </td></tr><tr><td>  Total Referral Revenue  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  93.5  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  88.8  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  4.7  </td><td>  5%  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  456.2  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  476.8  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  (20.6)  </td><td>  (4)%  </td></tr><tr><td>  Other revenue  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  1.3  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2.9  </td><td>     </td><td>  (1.6)  </td><td>  (55)%  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  4.7  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  8.2  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (3.5)  </td><td>  (43)%  </td></tr><tr><td>  Total revenue  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  94.8  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  91.7  </td><td>  €  </td><td>  3.1  </td><td>  3%  </td><td>  €  </td><td>  460.8  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  485.0  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  (24.2)  </td><td>  (5)%  </td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"\"><em>Note:</em> <em>Some</em> <em>figures</em> <em>may</em> <em>not</em> <em>add</em> <em>up</em> <em>due</em> <em>to</em><em> rounding.</em></p><p class=\"\">Total revenue increased by €3.1 million during the three months ended December 31, 2024, and decreased by €24.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. For the three months ended December 31, 2024, the increase was primarily driven by growth from branded channel traffic in response to our brand marketing investments and improved booking conversion. This was partly offset by lower performance marketing channel traffic volumes from increased competition and softer bidding dynamics observed on our platform. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, the overall decline of €24.2 million was the result of lower performance marketing channel traffic volumes from increased competition and softer bidding dynamics on our platform, which outweighed the revenue growth from branded channel traffic in response to our increased brand marketing investments and improved booking conversion.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><em>Americas</em></strong></p><p class=\"\">Referral Revenue increased by €2.7 million and decreased by €2.8 million during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023.

For the three months ended December 31, 2024, the increase was partly offset by lower performance marketing channel traffic volumes. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, the growth in branded channel traffic revenue was more than offset by the decline in performance marketing channel traffic volumes, resulting in an overall decline.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><em>Developed Europe</em></strong></p><p class=\"\">Referral Revenue decreased by €0.6 million and €23.6 million during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decreases were primarily driven by lower performance marketing channel traffic volumes and softer bidding dynamics on our platform. Despite the overall decreases, we observed higher revenues generated from branded channel traffic sources, reaching double-digit growth in both the third and fourth quarters of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, as a result of increased brand investments.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><em>Rest of World</em></strong></p><p class=\"\">Referral Revenue increased by €2.6 million and €5.8 million during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023.

These were partly offset primarily by slightly softer bidding dynamics. While revenues generated from performance marketing channels were still lower during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, we saw a year-over- year increase in the third and fourth quarters of 2024, particularly driven by traffic derived from sources other than Google.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><em>Other Revenue</em></strong></p><p class=\"\">Other revenue decreased by €1.6 million and €3.5 million during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease during the three months was driven by lower depositary fee reimbursements and the discontinuation of other B2B revenue sources in the middle of 2024. The decrease for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 was further driven by the progressive reduction of white label revenues as we discontinued the product over the course of 2023.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Advertiser Concentration</strong></p><p class=\"\">We generate the majority of our Referral Revenue from online travel agencies, or OTAs.

For brands affiliated with Booking Holdings, including Booking.com, Agoda and priceline.com, the share of our Referral Revenue was 39% during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024, compared to 43% in the same periods in 2023.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Advertising Spend</strong></p><p class=\"\">Advertising Spend is included in selling and marketing expense and consists of fees that we pay for our various marketing channels like TV, search engine marketing, display and affiliate marketing, email marketing, online video, app marketing, content marketing, and sponsorship and endorsement.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Advertising Spend by Segment (€ millions)</strong>    </p><div class=\"tableWrapper-pIO_GYwT\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td> </td><td colspan=\"7\">  Three months ended December 31,  </td><td> </td><td colspan=\"7\">  Twelve months ended December 31,  </td></tr><tr><td>     </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2024  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2023  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  Δ€  </td><td>  Δ%  </td><td>     </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2024  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2023  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  Δ€  </td><td>  Δ%Y/Y  </td></tr><tr><td>  Americas  </td><td>  €  </td><td>  22.6  </td><td>  €  </td><td>  19.2  </td><td>  €  </td><td>  3.4  </td><td>  18%  </td><td>     </td><td>  €  </td><td>  136.4  </td><td>  €  </td><td>  119.0  </td><td>  €  </td><td>  17.4  </td><td>  15%  </td></tr><tr><td>  Developed Europe  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  21.0  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  24.6  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (3.6)  </td><td>  (15)%  </td><td>     </td><td colspan=\"2\">  136.3  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  147.7  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (11.4)  </td><td>  (8)%  </td></tr><tr><td>  Rest of World  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  13.8  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  13.4  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  0.4  </td><td>  3%  </td><td>     </td><td colspan=\"2\">  72.7  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  56.5  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  16.2  </td><td>  29%  </td></tr><tr><td>  Total Advertising Spend  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  57.4  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  57.2  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  0.2  </td><td>  0%  </td><td>     </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  345.4  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  323.2  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  22.2  </td><td>  7%  </td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"\"><em>Note: Some figures may not add up due to rounding.</em></p><p class=\"\">Total Advertising Spend increased by €0.2 million and €22.2 million during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023.

These were partly offset by higher share-based compensation expense in connection with restricted stock units (RSUs) issued for marketing services received.</p><p class=\"\">The increase during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 was primarily driven by higher television advertisement production costs, the recognition of cumulative Canadian digital services taxes in the second quarter of 2024 as legislation was passed with retroactive effect from January 1, 2022, and higher share-based compensation expense in connection with RSUs issued for marketing services received. These were partly offset by lower expenses incurred to acquire traffic related to our products that were discontinued over the course of 2023, lower marketing expenses due to the end of our long- term sponsorship agreement, the non-recurrence of marketing commitments written off in 2023, and lower personnel expenses resulting mostly from lower headcount.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Technology and Content</strong></p><p class=\"\">Technology and content expense increased by €0.4 million and €1.2 million during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023.</p><p class=\"\">The increases in both periods were primarily driven by higher non-core cloud-related service provider costs, including a one-time fee paid in the fourth quarter of 2024 related to a contract amendment. The increases were partly offset by lower depreciation and salaries expenses as a result of the tax credits mentioned below. The increases were further offset by lower share-based compensation and content- related service provider costs. The increase in the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 was further driven by higher personnel costs due to lower capitalized developer salaries as certain projects finalized at the end of 2023, and higher annual compensation costs, partly offset by lower headcount during the first half of 2024.</p><p class=\"\">In the fourth quarter of 2024, we received approval from the German tax authority for €1.4 million in tax credits related to certain capitalized development costs incurred between 2020 and 2022 associated with our website and internal-use software.

As a result, we recorded a credit to technology and content operating expenses of €1.0 million, primarily representing depreciation expenses already recognized in prior periods, in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024.

These decreases were primarily driven by lower personnel costs relating to changes in the executive leadership, lower legal expenses, and the non-recurrence of American Depositary Share (ADS) cancellation fees incurred in connection with our equity restructuring completed in 2023. The decrease in the three months ended December 31, 2024 was partly offset by higher share-based compensation expense compared to the same period in 2023.

Additionally, as a result of our annual impairment test performed in the third quarter of 2024, we recorded an impairment charge of €30.0 million to our indefinite-lived intangible assets. The impairment was driven by the decline in revenue observed in 2024 compared to the prior year primarily resulting from the headwinds in our performance marketing channels that have delayed our previously expected growth and continued uncertainty in respect of the overall economic environment. Share price declines observed during 2024 have also reduced our total market capitalization relative to our net assets.</p><p class=\"\">As a result of our annual impairment test performed in the third quarter of 2023, the Developed Europe and Americas reporting unit goodwill balances were eliminated as a result of impairment charges of €95.5 million and €86.5 million, respectively.

The impairments were driven by adjustments made to our profitability outlook arising from the announced strategy shift to long-term growth, share price decline during the third quarter of 2023, uncertainty in our operating environment, and the continued uncertainty in respect of the overall economic environment.</p><p class=\"\">Income Taxes, Net Loss and Adjusted EBITDA(1) (€ millions)</p><div class=\"tableWrapper-pIO_GYwT\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td> </td><td colspan=\"6\">Three months ended December 31,</td><td> </td><td> </td><td colspan=\"6\">Twelve months ended December 31,</td></tr><tr><td>     </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2024   </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2023  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  Δ €  </td><td>     </td><td colspan=\"3\">  2024  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2023  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  Δ €  </td></tr><tr><td>  Operating income/(loss)  </td><td>€ </td><td>7.8</td><td>  €  </td><td>          4.4  </td><td>  €  </td><td>          3.4  </td><td>     </td><td colspan=\"2\">  €  </td><td>   (32.2)  </td><td>  €  </td><td>  (156.6)  </td><td>  €  </td><td>   124.4  </td></tr><tr><td>  Other income/(expense)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"4\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td></tr><tr><td>  Interest expense  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (0.0)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (0.0)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  0.0  </td><td colspan=\"4\">  (0.0)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (0.0)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  0.0  </td></tr><tr><td>  Interest income  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  0.8  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  1.1  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (0.3)  </td><td colspan=\"4\">  3.6  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  5.2  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (1.6)  </td></tr><tr><td>  Other, net  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (0.0)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (0.1)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  0.1  </td><td colspan=\"4\">  0.4  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (0.5)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  0.9  </td></tr><tr><td>  Total other income, net  </td><td>  €  </td><td>          0.8  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">          0.9  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">     (0.1)  </td><td>     </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"2\">          3.9  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">          4.7  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">     (0.8)  </td></tr><tr><td>     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"4\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td></tr><tr><td>  Income/(loss) before income taxes  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  8.7  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  5.4  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  3.3  </td><td colspan=\"4\">  (28.2)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (151.9)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  123.7  </td></tr><tr><td>  Expense/(benefit) for income taxes  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2.8  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  2.8  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  0.0  </td><td colspan=\"4\">  (6.3)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  12.4  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (18.7)  </td></tr><tr><td>  Income/(loss) before equity method investments  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">          5.8  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">          2.5  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">          3.3  </td><td>     </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"2\">   (22.0)  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  (164.3)  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">   142.3  </td></tr><tr><td>  Loss from equity method investments  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (0.8)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (0.0)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (0.7)  </td><td colspan=\"4\">  (1.7)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (0.2)  </td><td colspan=\"2\">  (1.5)  </td></tr><tr><td>  Net income/(loss)  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">          5.1  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">          2.5  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">          2.6  </td><td>     </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"2\">   (23.7)  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">  (164.5)  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">   140.8  </td></tr><tr><td>     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"4\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td><td colspan=\"2\">     </td></tr><tr><td>  Adjusted EBITDA(1)  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">   11.1  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">          7.3  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">          3.8  </td><td>     </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"2\">   10.2  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">   54.1  </td><td>  €  </td><td colspan=\"1\">   (43.9)  </td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"\"><em>Note: Some figures may not add up due to rounding.</em></p><p class=\"\">_____________________(1) “Adjusted EBITDA” is a non-GAAP measure.

This was partly offset by the €10.2 million equity investment in Holisto Limited in the third quarter of 2024 and cash outflows of €2.8 million related to capital expenditures, including internal-use software and website development. The €1.0 million non-cash receipt of tax credits presented on the statement of cash flows relates to the total tax credits recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024 (see \"Technology and Content\" for more details). The net €0.4 million credit recorded in property and equipment on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet consists of an initial €1.0 million non-cash credit, net of €0.6 million of accumulated depreciation related to depreciation expense already recognized in prior periods.</p><p class=\"\">Cash used in financing activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, was primarily driven by the payments totaling €0.7 million related to withholding taxes on net share settlements of equity awards.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">trivago N.V.

A “non-GAAP financial measure” refers to a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP in such company’s financial statements. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate our operating performance, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions on capital allocation. We also believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating performance and consolidated results of operations in the same manner as our management, and the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure in comparing financial results between periods as these costs may vary independent of core business performance.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, including net income/loss. Some of these limitations are:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect expenses, such as restructuring and other related reorganization costs;</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Although depreciation, amortization and impairments are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated, amortized or impaired may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; and</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.</li></ul><p class=\"\">We periodically provide an Adjusted EBITDA outlook. We are, however, unable to provide a reconciliation of our Adjusted EBITDA outlook to net income/(loss), the comparable GAAP measure, because certain items that are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA cannot be reasonably or reliably predicted or are not in our control, including, in particular, the timing or magnitude of share-based compensation, interest, taxes, impairments, restructuring related costs and/or significant legal settlements and court-ordered penalties without unreasonable efforts, and these items could significantly impact, either individually or in the aggregate, net

Operating profit for this segment increased to $112 million, while Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $173 million. The decline in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA was attributed to lower global drilling activity, partially offset by the adoption of new technologically advanced products.</p><p class=\"\">Energy Equipment reported revenues of $1.29 billion for the fourth quarter, also a slight decrease from the previous year. However, operating profit increased to $152 million, and Adjusted EBITDA rose to $185 million, driven by strong execution on higher margin projects from the segment’s backlog.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments</strong></p> <p class=\"\">During the fourth quarter, NOV repurchased 7.5 million shares of common stock for $112 million, bringing the total for the year to 14.2 million shares repurchased for $229 million. Including dividends, the company returned $337 million to shareholders in 2024.
