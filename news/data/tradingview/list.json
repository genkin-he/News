Any celebrations look somewhat premature, they say. \"The Canadian government will likely have to make much more onerous concessions to ensure that the tariff threat is lifted permanently, and this appears far from a done deal to us.\" This recent drama could resume in a few weeks with risks that next time won't result in another deal for U.S. tariffs to be suspended, they say. USD/CAD trades flat at 1.4434 after hitting a 22-year high of 1.4793 Monday, according to FactSet. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1029 GMT - The Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates when it announces a decision Thursday, and it could hint at another interest-rate cut in March, Berenberg's senior economist Andrew Wishart says in a note. \"Until now, the BOE has cut at alternate meetings, but a stagnating economy and declining employment argue for more urgent action,\" he says. Markets price in a total of 30 basis points of interest-rate cuts in February and March, LSEG Refinitiv data show. \"It is sensible for the BOE to lower interest rates to prevent a larger drop in [U.K.] employment,\" Wishart says. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1027 GMT - China's tariff retaliation is smaller than expected and largely symbolic, Morningstar analyst Kai Wang says in a note. Trump's latest 10% blanket tariff on Chinese goods has an immediate impact only on some industries, such as home appliances, lithium batteries and EVs, the analyst says. Wang notes that the products included in China's countermeasures, such as coal and liquefied natural gas, accounted for just 12% of the country's imports from the U.S., implying less risk than previously expected. However, the analyst still warns of the possibility of an escalating trade war given Trump's unpredictability.(sherry.qin@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1008 GMT - Donald Trump's trade policy announcements over the weekend raise the question of whether there is a bigger risk from tariffs to the eurozone than previously thought, according to Capital Economics' Andrew Kenningham. A 10% universal tariff imposed by the U.S. might shave 0.1% to 0.2% off eurozone GDP, he says in a note. But a 25% tariff, as imposed but suspended on Canada and Mexico, would have a more-than-proportionately larger effect because it would be harder for companies and exchange-rate moves to cushion the blow, Kenningham warns. A ball-park estimate is that would cut eurozone GDP by around 0.5%, leaving growth close to zero this year. Additionally, a prohibitive tariff of, say, 100% on European vehicles could on its own push Germany into recession. (edward.frankl@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1005 GMT - The dollar could suffer a further pullback if the U.S. and China move towards a de-escalation in their trade dispute, ING analyst Francesco Pesole says in a note. A new 10% U.S. tariff on China took effect Tuesday and China has announced retaliatory tariffs. Markets seem to price in a good chance of the U.S. and China striking a deal and delaying tariffs after Trump agreed to pause planned 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. However, the case for significant dollar depreciation is weak as the tariff threat remains, Pesole says. Trump has \"more concretely introduced the tariff threat into daily market news.\" The DXY dollar index falls 0.5% to 108.484. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0957 GMT - U.S. tariffs are likely to end up not as bad as markets had feared, says Jefferies' Mohit Kumar in a note. Jefferies is therefore positive on risky assets over a 3-month to 6-month horizon. The macroeconomic backdrop remains supportive and positioning is light, the global economist says. That said, the coming days are likely to be dominated by headlines around negotiations with China, while Europe is likely the next in the tariffs and negotiations story, he says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0948 GMT - Sterling falls on the day but remains comfortably above Monday's lows against the dollar when U.S. President Trump's tariffs on Canada and Mexico--which he later agreed to pause--unsettled markets. ING analyst Francesco Pesole says any sterling losses should be limited because tariffs shouldn't unduly harm the U.K. economy. Exports to the U.S. are less than 2% of gross domestic product, while Trump \"seems in no rush to hit the U.K. with tariffs,\" he says in a note. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's trip to Brussels to discuss security and defence is positive for sterling as it signals intent to repair EU relations, he says. Sterling falls 0.3% to $1.2409, still well above Monday's low of $1.2248. EUR/GBP rises 0.1% to 0.8322.

However, this bond is less appealing as the Debt Management Office is set to sell this bond once more this quarter on March 5. \"We're struggling to get particularly excited about the bond on relative value here given its heavy tapping schedule ahead,\" the analysts say. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0908 GMT - The yields on U.K. government bonds, or gilts, rise, tracking moves in their U.S. and eurozone counterparts after U.S. President Trump paused tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a month, sparking a shift away from safe-haven bonds for now. Tariffs remain a risk and investors are concerned about the harm this could do to the U.K. economy, dampening growth while lifting inflation, Pantheon Macroeconomics economists say in a note. \"We think President Trump's tariffs, by fracturing supply chains, will be stagflationary for the U.K.\" Tariffs could potentially mean fewer interest-rate cuts by the Bank of England as inflation rebounds, the economists say. The 10-year gilt yield climbs 4 basis points to last trade at 4.520%, Tradeweb data show. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0855 GMT - The dollar falls after President Trump delayed tariffs on Canada and Mexico for one month, but uncertainty remains and this could soon lift the safe-haven dollar once more, Commerzbank's Antje Praefcke says in a note. There is a risk of new tariff announcements coming at any time, she says. \"The next shock is bound to come, and this will probably be dollar-positive again.\" Key U.S. economic data this week--including ISM data on services Wednesday and monthly jobs data Friday--will also likely lift the dollar as long as they underpin the story of a resilient U.S. economy, she says. The DXY dollar index falls 0.4% to 108.589, having hit a three-week high of 109.881 Monday. (jessica.fleetham@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0843 GMT - The euro remains under pressure as tariff risks remain heightened even after President Trump agreed to pause tariffs on Canada and Mexico, Danske Bank analyst Stefan Mellin says in a note. Tariff headlines will likely remain the primary driver of price action in the coming weeks, with a risk of Trump announcing measures against Europe, he says. Still, Trump looks to be using tariff announcements \"primarily as a negotiating tool\" and this could help the euro to recover back into a $1.04-$1.05 range. \"We believe Trump is ultimately likely to under-deliver on maintaining tariffs for an extended period,\" Mellin says. The euro falls 0.2% on the day to $1.0323. It hit a three-week low of $1.0213 Monday, according to FactSet. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)The dollar falls slightly after President Trump agreed to hold off imposing 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. \"Dollar Edges Lower After Trump Pauses Canada, Mexico Tariffs — Market Talk,\" at 0756 GMT, incorrectly said Trump agreed to hold off imposing 25% tariffs on China.</p></span></div>",

Any celebrations look somewhat premature, they say. \"The Canadian government will likely have to make much more onerous concessions to ensure that the tariff threat is lifted permanently, and this appears far from a done deal to us.\" This recent drama could resume in a few weeks with risks that next time won't result in another deal for U.S. tariffs to be suspended, they say. USD/CAD trades flat at 1.4434 after hitting a 22-year high of 1.4793 Monday, according to FactSet. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
