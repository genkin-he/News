            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\"><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.barchart.com/investing-ideas/ai-stocks?viewName=performance\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Artificial intelligence (AI)</a> has been a game-changer for businesses, fueling innovation and transforming industries at an unprecedented pace. Over the past year, companies have scrambled to integrate this revolutionary technology, unlocking new efficiencies, enhancing customer experiences, and redefining competitive landscapes. From automating workflows to supercharging data analytics, AI has become the secret weapon for growth, and those who embrace it are reaping the rewards.</p><p class=\"\">While the spotlight often shines on AI powerhouses like Nvidia , Alphabet , Microsoft , or Apple , some lesser-known players are quietly making waves, and one of them is BigBear.ai Holdings . Specializing in <a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.barchart.com/story/news/30475827/up-130-in-6-months-is-penny-stock-bigbear-ai-still-a-buy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">AI-powered decision intelligence</a>, BigBear.ai is carving out a niche in national security, supply chain optimization, and digital identity, areas where AI-driven insights are becoming mission-critical.</p><p class=\"\">As businesses and governments double down on AI to enhance operations, improve security, and streamline decision-making, demand for BigBear.ai’s solutions is poised to climb. In fact, the company has recently wooed investors after <a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.barchart.com/story/news/30693514/why-bigbearai-stock-is-skyrocketing-today\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">securing a major contract</a> under the U.S. Department of Navy’s SeaPort Next Generation (SeaPort NxG) program, reinforcing its credibility and growth prospects. Thus, with its expanding footprint in high-growth sectors and a fresh government contract signaling momentum, is now the time to bet on this rising AI penny stock?</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About BigBear.ai Stock</strong></p><p class=\"\">Maryland-based BigBear.ai Holdings  is at the forefront of AI-powered decision intelligence, delivering cutting-edge solutions for national security, digital identity, and supply chain management. In an era where real-time insights are critical, the company’s advanced AI and predictive analytics serve defense and intelligence agencies, border protection, transportation security, manufacturing, logistics, and even travel and entertainment, helping organizations and government agencies to navigate complex, high-stakes environments with confidence.</p><p class=\"\">With a market capitalization of around $1.1 billion, this penny stock has been on an absolute tear, delivering a staggering 199% gain over the past year, leaving the broader S&amp;P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 20.9% return in the dust. The momentum has only intensified in the past six months, with the stock soaring 264%, crushing the SPX’s 12.1% gain over the same period. As investors chase high-growth AI plays, this under-the-radar stock is proving to be a breakout winner. </p><p class=\"\">Following the stock’s meteoric rise over the recent months, BBAI presently trades at 5.74 times sales, edging past the sector median of 3.30x, signaling investor confidence in the company’s AI-driven growth potential and expanding market presence.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">A Closer Look at BigBear.ai’s Q3 Financials</strong></p><p class=\"\">The company disclosed its third-quarter earnings report on Nov. 5, which revealed 22% year-over growth in sales to $41.5 million. However, while top-line growth is accelerating, profitability remains a key challenge. The company reported a gross margin of just 25.9%, a figure that lags behind typical AI software businesses.</p><p class=\"\">Furthermore, the company’s bottom line took a hit in Q3, posting a loss of $0.05 per share. Despite being better than Wall Street’s forecast loss per share of $0.07, the reported loss marks a stark reversal from the $0.03 profit per share registered in the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, BigBear.ai’s backlog, which stood at a solid $437 million as of Sep. 30, 2024, signals strong future demand.</p><p class=\"\">While reflecting on BigBear.ai’s Q3 performance, former CEO Mandy Long emphasized the company’s steady progress in building a long-term, sustainable business backed by solid cash reserves. However, she acknowledged that regulatory caution toward AI continues to create hurdles, leading to uneven growth.</p><p class=\"\">Despite these challenges, BigBear.ai remains focused on navigating the complexities of the AI landscape with a strategic and measured approach. Looking forward to fiscal 2024, management anticipates revenue to land between $165 million and $180 million.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">BigBear.ai Secures Key U.S. Navy Contract</strong></p><p class=\"\">On Jan. 30, shares of BigBear.ai closed up more than 13% after the company landed a prime Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under the U.S. Department of Navy’s SeaPort Next Generation (SeaPort NxG) program, a major win that reinforces its standing in national security. As the U.S. Navy’s premier contracting platform, SeaPort NxG streamlines procurement for technical, engineering, and professional services, giving BigBear.ai a direct avenue to deliver mission-critical AI solutions to the Navy and other federal agencies.</p><p class=\"\">Newly appointed CEO Kevin McAleenan emphasized the company’s commitment to strengthening national defense, viewing the contract as a testament to BigBear.ai’s cutting-edge capabilities. With this award, BigBear.ai is poised to provide advanced systems engineering and specialized technology solutions, further solidifying its reputation as a trusted AI partner for the defense sector.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">What Do Analysts Expect for BigBear.ai Stock?</strong></p><p class=\"\">While the coverage is light, Wall Street appears largely bullish on BBAI stock, maintaining a consensus rating of “Strong Buy.” Of the four analysts offering recommendations, three advise a “Strong Buy,” and the remaining one analyst maintains a “Hold.” The average analyst price target of $4.33 indicates only 2.4% potential upside. However, the Street-high price target of $7 suggests that BBAI could rally as much as 65.5% from here. </p><p class=\"\"><em> On the date of publication, Anushka Mukherji did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The company's U.S. business jumped 52% from a year earlier. \"Our business results continue to astound, demonstrating our deepening position at the center of the (artificial intelligence) revolution.

For the first quarter, Palantir said it expects revenue of $858 million to $862 million, up 36% from 2024 at the midpoint and better than Wall Street estimates of $799 million.</p><p class=\"\">Tesla  was up 0.2% after shares of the electric-vehicle giant slumped 5.2% on Monday. The stock closed lower after it was announced that tariffs levied on Mexico by the U.S. would be delayed by a month but before President Donald Trump struck a similar deal with Canada. The electric-vehicle maker assembles all its vehicles for the U.S. market in the U.S. but about 15% of the parts in a Model Y sold in the U.S. come from Mexico.</p><p class=\"\">Shares of Nvidia, the leading maker of artificial-intelligence chips, were up 1.5%.  Nvidia declined 2.8% on Monday as Wall Street gauged the potential effects of the Trump administration's tariffs on chip companies and amid continued worries over AI advancements made by China's DeepSeek.</p><p class=\"\">Super Micro Computer rose 6.5%. The maker of AI servers said it would be providing a fiscal second-quarter \" business update\" on Feb. 11. The Nasdaq Stock Market told the company in November that it wasn't in compliance with a listing rule requiring timely filing of reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In early December, the company said it expected to file its delayed financial statements by Feb. 25.</p><p class=\"\">PepsiCo posted fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.96 a share, beating analysts' estimates of $1.94 but the stock fell 1.8% after revenue declined 0.2% from a year earlier to $27.78 billion and missed expectations of $27.89 billion. Shares fell 4.3%.</p><p class=\"\">Shares of Spotify Technology jumped 11% after the audio-streaming company added more premium subscribers in the fourth quarter than Wall Street expected, helping revenue top estimates.</p><p class=\"\">Merck fell 10% after the drug maker reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings that beat analysts' estimates but issued guidance for f2025 that missed expectations. Merck said it expects 2025 adjusted earnings of $8.88 to $9.03 a share, below consensus of $9.21.</p><p class=\"\">Pfizer was down 1.9%. The company reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 63 cents a share, beating analysts' forecasts of 46 cents, and the company reaffirmed guidance for 2025.</p><p class=\"\">PayPal declined 12%. The fintech beat fourth-quarter earnings and sales estimates, and said total payment volume rose 7% in the quarter, while payment transactions decreased 3%.</p><p class=\"\">Estée Lauder, the luxury beauty brand, slumped 16% after it issued weak earnings guidance, said it expects to cut between 5,800 and 7,000 positions as part of a two-year restructuring plan, and would record more than $1 billion in pretax charges on employee-related costs.</p><p class=\"\">Ferrari was up 7.7% after the Italian supercar maker reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and revenue.</p><p class=\"\">Clorox reported a 15% drop in fiscal second-quarter sales to $1.69 billion, and said it now expects fiscal-year sales to fall 1% to 2%, down from a prior outlook for sales to be flat to down 2%. Shares of the cleaning-products maker were down 6.6%.</p><p class=\"\">Earnings reports are expected after the closing bell Tuesday from Alphabet, Advanced Micro Devices, Chipotle Mexican Grill, and Amgen.</p><p class=\"\">Alphabet rose 1.9% ahead of fourth-quarter earnings from the parent of Google. Wall Street expects Alphabet to report earnings of $2.13 a share on revenue of $96.7 billion, up from per-share profit of $1.64 on revenue of $86.3 billion a year earlier.

Trump on Monday agreed to postpone the measures on both countries for 30 days in exchange for heightened border security measures. </p><p class=\"\">\"Crude oil initially surged on concerns over Canadian supply but quickly reversed lower after a one-month tariff delay and escalating trade tensions between the US and China - both major energy consumers.

Don't hold your breath until Donald Trump is content with the OPEC+ strategy but should the export tariffs on Canadian and Mexican oil be re-introduced further down the line and prices strengthen again, the tapering might just take place. In case of a price drop and another delay in easing output restrictions, Mr Trump's patience will be severely tested,\" PVM Oil Associates noted.</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Andrew Welsch</p><p class=\"\">Shares of UBS dropped after the Swiss bank cautioned investors that its $3 billion stock buyback plan could be curtailed depending on how Swiss regulators reform capital requirements.</p><p class=\"\">The warning overshadowed other good news in UBS' fourth-quarter earnings report and the bank's plans to improve profitability in its Americas wealth management business, which oversees approximately $2.1 trillion in assets.</p><p class=\"\">On Tuesday, UBS reported fourth-quarter net profit of $770 million, blowing past analyst estimates of $457 million thanks to a surge in investment banking revenue. Diluted earnings per share came in at 23 cents, seven cents below Wall Street estimates, according to FactSet. UBS shares were down 7.1% in New York trading Tuesday afternoon. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.73%.</p><p class=\"\">UBS said it plans to repurchase $1 billion of shares in the first half of the year and an additional $2 billion in the second half. But the Zurich-based company said those plans are subject to certain conditions and assumes no material changes to the current capital regime requirements in Switzerland. CEO Sergio Ermotti, speaking during a call with analysts, cautioned regulators against \"disproportionate\" changes.</p><p class=\"\">\"Offsetting the consequences of higher requirements would make us uncompetitive domestically and abroad, hamper our ability to help clients grow and, importantly, make banking services more expensive for Swiss families and enterprises in the long run,\" he said. \"It will also damage the nation's standing as an attractive global financial center and ultimately hurt our position as the third largest private employer in Switzerland. Of course, this would have an impact on our returns on capital. But even more importantly, it would impede our ability to compete for capital in the global marketplace, particularly in a moment of financial stress.\"</p><p class=\"\">Given the slump in the stock price, investors clearly took note. \"We expect investors will remain cautious about the shares until there is clarity regarding UBS's minimum capital requirements,\" Morningstar analyst Johann Scholtz wrote Tuesday. \"UBS expects the Swiss government to present its proposals in first-half 2025.\"</p><p class=\"\">Wealth. While a jump in investment banking revenue lifted UBS this quarter, the company placed emphasis on improving profitability and asset-gathering in its wealth management business, which along with asset management generates a majority of the company's revenue.</p><p class=\"\">UBS said it aims to increase returns in wealth management and haul in $100 billion in net new assets in 2025. UBS expects that annual figure to increase to approximately $200 billion by 2028 after overcoming some short-term headwinds, including potential financial advisor attrition related to recent changes it made to advisor pay for 2025. UBS trimmed payouts for some advisors with smaller amounts of assets under management as a growth incentive. (Advisor compensation is one of the largest expenses for wealth management companies.) UBS reported $18 billion in net new assets in Global Wealth Management for the fourth quarter and $97 billion in for the full year.</p><p class=\"\">By comparison, rival Morgan Stanley  reported net new assets of $252 billion for all of 2024. Charles Schwab  reported $367 billion for the year.</p><p class=\"\">To achieve its growth goals, UBS said it aims to improve profitability across its Americas wealth business and hit a profit margin of 15% in 2027, up from its current level of approximately 10%. The company says it will work to bring expenses down, efforts that include streamlining organizational structure and adjusting advisor pay.</p><p class=\"\">CFO Todd Tucker told analysts, responding to analysts, said the advisor pay changes were intended to better align compensation with the company's strategy and practices at competitors.</p><p class=\"\">\"It's important to keep in mind that the changes we're making are really not intended to reduce compensation but to increase it as long as it's being done in ways that are very aligned with our strategy, and I think that's the most important point,\" Tucker said.</p><p class=\"\">UBS also wants to win more business with ultrahigh-net-worth and high-net-worth clients and drum up new business with mass-affluent customers. In particular, the company is eyeing how to expand its banking capabilities in the U.S. Lending to wealth management clients can be a lucrative way to win wallet share with existing customers, for instance.</p><p class=\"\">Tucker said UBS is investing in its digital-focused Wealth Advice Center, which serves mass-affluent clients. UBS hopes to \"to make it a more meaningful contributor to organic growth and to lower our cost to serve, \" he said. The company will double its staffing in the Wealth Advice Center to better serve clients.</p><p class=\"\">Tucker described this and other efforts to win more affluent clients was not a change in strategy at UBS, which is \"overweight\" ultrawealthy clients.</p><p class=\"\">\"What we're trying to do is rebalance,\" he said. \"So obviously, stay very penetrated in ultra[wealthy], but increase our penetration in high-net-worth and affluent to create a better balance more in line with the market.\"</p><p class=\"\">He also said UBS is moving ahead with plans to obtain a national bank charter, which would enable it to offer more banking products and services to its clients, but he cautioned that this is a multiyear process.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Andrew Welsch at andrew.welsch@barrons.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
