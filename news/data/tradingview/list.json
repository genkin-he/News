            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">The yen strengthens against other G-10 and Asian currencies in the morning session. Japanese data released earlier showed the economy's real wages rose 0.6% in December from a year earlier, marking a second straight month of increases. A solid rise in Japanese labor cash earnings will reinforce the current market pricing in at least one more rate hike by the BOJ this year, CBA's Joseph Capurso says in a note. In addition, with the 'tariff war' between the U.S. and other countries seemingly ongoing, the AUD/JPY is likely to retest support at 94.69, the head of International and Sustainable Economics adds. USD/JPY falls 0.6% to 153.36; AUD/JPY drops 0.7% to 95.88. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Japan's services sector is off to a strong start in 2025, the au Jibun Bank PMI compiled by S&amp;P Global suggests. January data point to a solid upturn in business activity across the sector, accompanied by a steeper, solid rise in new business inflows. The survey signaled a sharp jump in average prices charged by service providers, while exports rose for the first time in four months. Firms are upbeat on their prospects over the coming 12 months and have boosted staffing levels, says Usamah Bhatti, economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Services continue to underpin growth in Japan's private sector, contrasting the weakness in manufacturing. Still, companies are confident that private-sector activity will rise over 2025, expecting a rebound in manufacturing output and a broad-based economic recovery, Bhatti says.

But should the required rate relief not come from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the risk of further ​job losses only grows, she says. The RBNZ's current forecasts suggest the OCR will get to 3.5% this year and no lower until deep in 2027. That will leave monetary conditions too restrictive, Vergara says. RBNZ will need to get the OCR down to 3% this year. Holding out longer will only cause unnecessary and indeed avoidable damage to the labor market, she adds.
