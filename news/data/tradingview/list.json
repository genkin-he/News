Adjusted operating income was $169 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, compared with $182 million, or $1.16 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024 and $158 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2023.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">New insurance written (NIW) was approximately $13 billion, down 2% from the third quarter of 2024 primarily from seasonality partially offset by an estimated increase in refinance originations and up 27% from the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily driven by estimated higher originations. NIW for the current quarter was comprised of 96% monthly premium policies and 86% purchase originations.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Primary insurance in-force (IIF) was a record $269 billion, up from $268 billion in the third quarter of 2024 and up 2% from $263 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Persistency remained elevated at 82%, down slightly from 83% in the third quarter of 2024 and down from 86% in the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease year-over-year was primarily driven by a decline in mortgage rates in September 2024. Approximately 70% of our IIF had mortgage rates below 6%.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Net premiums earned were $246 million, down 1% from $249 million in the third quarter of 2024 and up 2% from $240 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Net premiums decreased sequentially, primarily driven by higher ceded premiums and increased year over year driven by premium growth from attractive adjacencies and growth in primary insurance in-force, partially offset by higher ceded premiums.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Losses incurred for the fourth quarter of 2024 were $24 million and the loss ratio was 10%, compared to $12 million and 5%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024 and $24 million and 10%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2023. The current quarter reserve release of $56 million from favorable cure performance and loss mitigation activities compares to a reserve release of $65 million and $53 million in the third quarter of 2024 and fourth quarter of 2023, respectively. The sequential increase in losses and the loss ratio were primarily driven by a lower reserve release and new delinquencies are up 1% excluding hurricane-related delinquencies.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Operating expenses in the current quarter were $58 million and the expense ratio was 24%. This compared to $56 million and 22%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024 and $59 million and 25%, respectively in the fourth quarter of 2023. The sequential increase was driven by incentive-based compensation while the year-over-year decrease was driven in part by the impact of our cost reduction initiatives.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Net investment income was $63 million, up from $61 million in the third quarter of 2024 and $56 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, driven by the continuation of elevated interest rates and higher average invested assets.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Net investment loss in the quarter was $(7) million, as compared to $(1) million sequentially and $(1) million in the same period last year. The current period was primarily driven by the identification of assets that upon selling allow us to recoup losses through higher net investment income.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Annualized return on equity for the fourth quarter of 2024 was 13.0% and annualized adjusted operating return on equity was 13.5%. This compares to third quarter 2024 results of 14.7% and 14.8%, respectively, and to fourth quarter 2023 results of 13.8% and 13.9%, respectively.</li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Capital and Liquidity </strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">We returned $354 million to shareholders in 2024 inclusive of quarterly dividends and share repurchases.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">During the quarter, we announced two quota share reinsurance agreements with a panel of highly-rated reinsurers that will cede approximately 27% of a portion of expected new insurance written for the 2025 and 2026 book years.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">As previously announced, we paid approximately $28 million, or $0.185 per share, dividend in the fourth quarter.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">For the full year 2024, we repurchased 7.6 million shares at a weighted average share price of $31.95 for a total of $243 million.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">EMICO completed a distribution of approximately $230 million in the fourth quarter that will primarily be used to support our ability to return capital to shareholders and bolster financial flexibility.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Enact Holdings, Inc. held $243 million of cash and cash equivalents plus $298 million of invested assets as of December 31, 2024. Combined cash and invested assets increased $98 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to a contribution from EMICO, partially offset by share buybacks and our quarterly dividend.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">PMIERs sufficiency was 167% and $2.1 billion above the PMIERs requirements, compared to 173% and $2.2 billion above the PMIERs requirements in the third quarter of 2024.</li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Recent Events </strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">In January 2025, Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) upgraded the Insurer Financial Strength rating for EMICO to A from A- and also upgraded Enact’s senior debt rating to BBB.

These forward-looking statements may address, among other things, our expected financial and operational results, the related assumptions underlying our expected results, guidance concerning the future return of capital and the quotations of management. These forward-looking statements are distinguished by use of words such as “will,” “may,” “would,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “believe,” “designed,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “target,” “could,” “should,” or “intend,” the negative of these terms, and similar references to future periods. These views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements contained herein speak only as of the date of this press release. Factors or events that we cannot predict, including risks related to an economic downturn or a recession in the United States and in other countries around the world; changes in political, business, regulatory, and economic conditions; changes in or to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the “GSEs”), whether through Federal legislation, restructurings or a shift in business practices; failure to continue to meet the mortgage insurer eligibility requirements of the GSEs; competition for customers; lenders or investors seeking alternatives to private mortgage insurance; an increase in the number of loans insured through Federal government mortgage insurance programs, including those offered by the Federal Housing Administration; and other factors described in the risk factors contained in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC, may cause our actual results to differ from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Although Enact believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Enact can give no assurance that its expectations will be achieved and it undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">GAAP/Non-GAAP Disclosure Discussion</strong></p><p class=\"\">This communication includes the non-GAAP financial measures entitled “adjusted operating income (loss)”, “adjusted operating income (loss) per share,\" and “adjusted operating return on equity.\" Adjusted operating income (loss) per share is derived from adjusted operating income (loss). The chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and allocates resources on the basis of adjusted operating income (loss). Enact Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) defines adjusted operating income (loss) as net income (loss) excluding the after-tax effects of net investment gains (losses), restructuring costs and infrequent or unusual non-operating items, and gain (loss) on the extinguishment of debt. The Company excludes net investment gains (losses), gains (losses) on the extinguishment of debt and infrequent or unusual non-operating items because the Company does not consider them to be related to the operating performance of the Company and other activities. The recognition of realized investment gains or losses can vary significantly across periods as the activity is highly discretionary based on the timing of individual securities sales due to such factors as market opportunities or exposure management. Trends in the profitability of our fundamental operating activities can be more clearly identified without the fluctuations of these realized gains and losses. We do not view them to be indicative of our fundamental operating activities. Therefore, these items are excluded from our calculation of adjusted operating income. In addition, adjusted operating income (loss) per share is derived from adjusted operating income (loss) divided by shares outstanding. Adjusted operating return on equity is calculated as annualized adjusted operating income for the period indicated divided by the average of current period and prior periods’ ending total stockholders’ equity.</p><p class=\"\">While some of these items may be significant components of net income (loss) in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company believes that adjusted operating income (loss) and measures that are derived from or incorporate adjusted operating income (loss), including adjusted operating income (loss) per share on a basic and diluted basis and adjusted operating return on equity, are appropriate measures that are useful to investors because they identify the income (loss) attributable to the ongoing operations of the business. Management also uses adjusted operating income (loss) as a basis for determining awards and compensation for senior management and to evaluate performance on a basis comparable to that used by analysts. Adjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income (loss) per share on a basic and diluted basis are not substitutes for net income (loss) available to Enact Holdings, Inc.’s common stockholders or net income (loss) available to Enact Holdings, Inc.’s common stockholders per share on a basic and diluted basis determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, the Company’s definition of adjusted operating income (loss) may differ from the definitions used by other companies.</p><p class=\"\">Adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) available to Enact Holdings, Inc.’s common stockholders to adjusted operating income (loss) assume a 21% tax rate.</p><p class=\"\">The tables at the end of this press release provide a reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted operating income (loss) and U.S. GAAP return on equity to adjusted operating return on equity for the three months and twelve months ending December 31, 2024 and 2023, as well as for the three months ended September 30, 2024</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Exhibit A: </strong>Consolidated Statements of Income (amounts in thousands, except per share

Non-GAAP Information</strong></p><p class=\"\">Funds from Operations</p><p class=\"\">The company calculates FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). FFO represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.</p><p class=\"\">FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring the company's operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year-over-year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. The company also believes that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare the company's operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the company's properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of the company's properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact the company's results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of the company's performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as the company does, and, accordingly, the company's FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of the company's performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of the company's liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company's cash needs, including the company's ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. FFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.</p><p class=\"\">Cash Net Operating Income</p><p class=\"\">The company uses NOI internally to evaluate and compare the operating performance of the company's properties. The company believes cash NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the company's financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level, and when compared across periods, can be used to determine trends in earnings of the company's properties as this measure is not affected by (1) the non-cash revenue and expense recognition items, (2) the cost of funds of the property owner, (3) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP or (4) general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to the property owner. The company believes the exclusion of these items from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating the company's properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. Cash NOI is a measure of the operating performance of the company's properties but does not measure the company's performance as a whole. Cash NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income as computed in accordance with GAAP.</p><p class=\"\">Cash NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. The company defines cash NOI as operating revenues (rental income, tenant reimbursements (other than tenant improvement reimbursements), ground lease rental income and other property income) less property and related expenses (property expenses, ground lease expense, property marketing costs, real estate taxes and insurance), adjusted for non-cash revenue and operating expense items such as straight-line rent, amortization of lease intangibles, amortization of lease incentives and other adjustments. Cash NOI also excludes lease termination fees, tenant improvement reimbursements, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other nonproperty income and losses, acquisition-related expense, gains and losses from property dispositions, extraordinary items, tenant improvements, and leasing commissions. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating cash NOI, and accordingly, the company's cash NOI may not be comparable to the cash NOIs of other REITs.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About American Assets Trust, Inc.</strong></p><p class=\"\">American Assets Trust, Inc. is a full service, vertically integrated and self-administered real estate investment trust (\"REIT\"), headquartered in San Diego, California.

As we respond to the evolving housing environment, we will continue to remain nimble and execute our differentiated strategy — including investing in technology and accelerating product innovation — while delivering sustained value for all our stakeholders.\"</p><p class=\"\">Third Quarter Fiscal 2025 Results</p><p class=\"\">Net sales for the third quarter fiscal 2025 increased 15.3% to $644.9 million compared to the prior-year period. The number of U.S. homes sold in the third quarter fiscal 2025 increased 14.1% to 6,437 driven by an increase in demand across all sales channels. The ASP per U.S. home sold increased 2.8% to $94,900 due to an increase in the number of units sold through company-owned retail sales centers during the quarter. The number of Canadian factory-built homes sold in the quarter decreased to 209 homes compared to 249 homes in the prior-year period due to softening demand in certain markets.</p><p class=\"\">Gross profit increased by 28.1% to $181.0 million in the third quarter fiscal 2025 compared to the prior-year period. Gross profit margin was 28.1% of net sales, a 280-basis point expansion compared to 25.3% in the third quarter fiscal 2024. Gross margin expansion reflects higher ASPs on new homes sold through company-owned retail sales centers which also generated a greater percentage of total revenue in addition to lower input costs and acquisition synergy capture when compared to the prior-year period.</p><p class=\"\">Selling, general, and administrative expenses (\"SG&amp;A\") in the third quarter fiscal 2025 increased to $108.2 million from $85.1 million in the same period last year. SG&amp;A during the quarter increased due to higher variable compensation from higher sales volumes and profitability as well as investments in people and information systems to support future growth. SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales was 16.8%, compared to 15.2% in the prior year period.</p><p class=\"\">Net income increased by 31.0% to $61.5 million for the third quarter fiscal 2025 compared to the prior-year period. The increase in net income was driven by higher sales and gross profit partially offset by higher SG&amp;A in the quarter.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter fiscal 2025 increased by 25.7% to $83.3 million compared to the third quarter fiscal 2024. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 12.9%, compared to 11.8% in the prior-year period.</p><p class=\"\">As of December 28, 2024, Champion Homes had $581.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $11.5 million in the current quarter. The Company repurchased and retired $20 million of its common stock during the third quarter under the previously announced repurchase program. On January 30, 2025, the Board of Directors refreshed the share repurchase authorization to provide for $100 million of potential future repurchases.</p><p class=\"\">Conference Call and Webcast Information:</p><p class=\"\">Champion Homes' management will host a conference call tomorrow, February 5, 2025, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time, to discuss Champion Homes' financial results and an update on current operations.</p><p class=\"\">Investors and other interested parties can listen to a webcast of the live conference call by logging onto the Investor Relations section of Champion Homes' website at ir.championhomes.com.

Champion Homes uses these Non-GAAP Financial Measures for business planning purposes and in measuring its performance relative to that of its competitors. Champion Homes believes that these Non-GAAP Financial Measures are useful financial metrics to assess its operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that Champion Homes believes are not representative of its core business. These Non-GAAP Financial Measures are not intended to replace, and should not be considered superior to, the presentation of Champion Homes' financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP.</p><p class=\"\">Champion Homes defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss attributable to Champion Homes, Inc. plus expenses or minus income, (a) the provision for income taxes, (b) interest income or expense, net, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations, (e) non-cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets, (f) equity in net earnings or losses of ECN, (g) charges related to the remediation of the water intrusion product liability claims; and (h) other non-operating income and costs, including but not limited to those costs for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses, including the change in fair value of contingent consideration, and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales reported in the income statements.</p><p class=\"\">Champion Homes defines Adjusted Net Income as net income or loss attributable to Champion Homes, Inc. plus expenses or minus income (net of tax where applicable), (a) gain or loss from discontinued operations, (b) non-cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets, (c) equity in net earnings or losses of ECN, (d) charges related to the remediation of estimated water intrusion product liability, and (e) other non-operating income or expense including, but not limited to those costs for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses, including the change in fair value of contingent consideration, and idle facilities. Champion Homes defines Adjusted EPS as Adjusted Net Income divided by shares outstanding.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are not measures of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss, net sales, operating income or earnings per share prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. These Non-GAAP Financial Measures do not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities as defined by U.S. GAAP. Champion Homes believes that similar Non-GAAP Financial Measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate its performance and that of its competitors. However, Champion Homes use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures may vary from that of others in its industry. The Non-GAAP Financial Measures are reconciled from the respective measure under U.S. GAAP in the tables below.</p><p class=\"\">Forward-Looking Statements</p><p class=\"\">Statements in this press release, including certain statements regarding Champion Homes' strategic initiatives, and future market demand are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for \"forward-looking statements\" provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Our disciplined execution on higher volumes led to a record first quarter adjusted EBITDA and more than a 300 basis point year-over-year improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margin,” said Martie Edmunds Zakas, Chief Executive Officer of Mueller Water Products.</p><p class=\"\">“We are increasing our fiscal 2025 guidance to primarily reflect our first quarter results and the expected benefits from recent price actions. We expect to deliver gross and adjusted EBITDA margin gains this year supported by our operational and commercial initiatives, including the anticipated benefits from the recent closure of our legacy brass foundry.”</p><p class=\"\">“With our continued focus on serving our customers and delivering on our key strategic priorities, we are well-positioned to capture the benefits from the investments needed to address the aging North American water infrastructure. We are confident we can execute our key strategies while managing external challenges as we further strengthen Mueller for the long term to benefit all our stakeholders,” Ms. Zakas concluded.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Consolidated Results</strong></p><p class=\"\">Net sales for the 2025 first quarter increased $47.9 million, or 18.7 percent, to $304.3 million as compared with $256.4 million in the prior year quarter primarily due to increased volumes at Water Flow Solutions and Water Management Solutions and higher pricing across most product lines.</p><p class=\"\">Operating income for the first quarter increased $24.6 million, or 107.9 percent, to $47.4 million as compared with $22.8 million in the prior year quarter. Benefits from increased volumes, lower strategic reorganization and other charges, lower amortization and favorable price/cost were partially offset by higher SG&amp;A expenses and the impacts of the Israel-Hamas war at Water Management Solutions. Operating margin for the first quarter was 15.6 percent as compared with 8.9 percent in the prior year quarter.</p><p class=\"\">During the quarter, the Company incurred $1.7 million of strategic reorganization and other charges, primarily related to the leadership transition and severance. Additionally, the Company incurred $3.3 million in inventory and other asset write-downs associated with the closure of our legacy brass foundry in Decatur, Illinois, as we transition operations to our new foundry. Both of these amounts have been excluded from adjusted results.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted operating income increased $23.0 million, or 78.2 percent, to $52.4 million as compared with $29.4 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted operating margin improved to 17.2 percent as compared with 11.5 percent in the prior year quarter.</p><p class=\"\">Net income increased $21.0 million, or 146.9 percent, to $35.3 million as compared with $14.3 million in the prior year quarter. Net income margin improved to 11.6 percent as compared with 5.6 percent in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income increased $19.3 million, or 97.0 percent, to $39.2 million as compared with $19.9 million in the prior year quarter.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA of $63.5 million increased $18.7 million, or 41.7 percent, as compared with $44.8 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 20.9 percent as compared with 17.5 percent in the prior year quarter.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Segment Results</strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><em>Water Flow Solutions</em></strong></p><p class=\"\">Net sales for the 2025 first quarter increased $33.3 million, or 23.6 percent, to $174.6 million as compared with $141.3 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher volumes of iron gate and specialty valves as well as higher pricing across most product lines.</p><p class=\"\">Operating income and adjusted operating income were $35.3 million and $38.6 million, respectively, for the first quarter. Adjusted operating income increased $11.2 million, or 40.9 percent, compared with the prior year quarter. Benefits from increased volumes, lower amortization and favorable price/cost more than offset higher SG&amp;A expenses and unfavorable manufacturing performance. Operating margin and adjusted operating margin were 20.2 percent and 22.1 percent, respectively, as compared with the prior year quarter operating margin of 19.2 percent and adjusted operating margin of 19.4 percent.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA of $44.7 million increased $8.0 million, or 21.8 percent, as compared with $36.7 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.6 percent as compared with 26.0 percent in the prior year quarter.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><em>Water Management Solutions</em></strong></p><p class=\"\">Net sales for the 2025 first quarter increased $14.6 million, or 12.7 percent, to $129.7 million as compared with $115.1 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher volumes of hydrants as well as higher pricing across most product lines.</p><p class=\"\">Operating income and adjusted operating income were $27.3 million and $27.6 million, respectively, for the first quarter. Adjusted operating income increased $12.5 million, or 82.8 percent, compared with the prior year quarter. Benefits from higher volumes, favorable manufacturing performance, lower SG&amp;A expenses, including benefits from amortization and foreign exchange, and favorable price/cost more than offset the impacts of the Israel-Hamas war. Operating margin and adjusted operating margin were 21.0 percent and 21.3 percent, respectively, as compared with the prior year quarter operating and adjusted operating margins of 13.1 percent.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA of $32.6 million increased $10.5 million, or 47.5 percent, as compared with $22.1 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.1 percent as compared with 19.2 percent in the prior year quarter.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Interest Expense, Net</strong></p><p class=\"\">Interest expense, net, for the 2025 first quarter decreased to $1.6 million as compared with $3.3 million in the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of higher interest income.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Income Taxes</strong></p><p class=\"\">For the 2025 first quarter, income tax expense was $10.5 million, or 22.9 percent of income before tax, as compared with $2.6 million in the prior year quarter, or 15.4 percent of income before tax. The higher effective tax rate for the 2025 first quarter was primarily a result of the income tax rate in the prior year quarter, which included a $1.6 million income tax benefit associated with the expiration of an uncertain tax position that expired on December 31, 2023, and was offset by the release of a $1.6 million indemnification receivable in Other expense. Excluding the benefit in the prior year quarter, the effective tax rate for the 2025 first quarter was comparable to the prior year quarter.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Cash Flow and Balance Sheet</strong></p><p class=\"\">Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, decreased by $13.8 million to $54.1 million as compared with $67.9 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by changes in working capital, including other current liabilities such as incentive compensation, partially offset by higher net income compared with the prior year quarter.</p><p class=\"\">During the quarter, the Company invested $11.9 million in capital expenditures as compared with $5.7 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by increased expenditures in our foundries and timing of spending in the prior year.</p><p class=\"\">Free cash flow (defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures) for the quarter decreased by $20.0 million to $42.2 million as compared with $62.2 million in the prior year quarter, due to the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and higher capital expenditures.</p><p class=\"\">As of December 31, 2024, Mueller Water Products had $449.5 million of total debt outstanding and $338.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, resulting in a debt leverage ratio of 1.5 times and a net debt leverage ratio of 0.4 times. We did not have any borrowings under our ABL Agreement at the end of the quarter, nor did we borrow any amounts under our ABL during the quarter. There are no maturities on the Company’s debt financings until June 2029, and our 4.0 percent Senior Notes have no financial maintenance covenants.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Fiscal 2025 Outlook</strong></p><p class=\"\">The Company is increasing its guidance for fiscal 2025 consolidated net sales to be between $1,370 million and $1,390 million, or an increase of 4.2 percent to 5.7 percent compared with the prior year. The Company is also increasing its expectations for fiscal 2025 adjusted EBITDA to be between $310 million and $315 million, or an increase of 8.9 percent to 10.6 percent compared with the prior year. The Company anticipates free cash flow as a percentage of adjusted net income to be more than 80 percent in fiscal 2025. This guidance does not include any potential impacts from the recently announced tariffs.</p><p class=\"\">The Company’s expectations for certain additional financial metrics for fiscal 2025 are as follows:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Total SG&amp;A expenses between $240 million and $244 million</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Net interest expense between $10.5 million and $11.5 million</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Effective income tax rate between 25 percent and 27 percent</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Depreciation and amortization between $43 million and $45 million (1)</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Capital expenditures between $45 million and $50 million</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Pension benefit other than service of approximately $0.2 million</li></ul><p class=\"\">(1) In 2025, annual amortization expense will decrease by approximately $18 million due to customer relationship intangibles from 2005 becoming fully amortized.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Conference Call Webcast</strong></p><p class=\"\">Mueller Water Products’ quarterly earnings conference call will take place Wednesday, February 5, 2025, at 9:30 a.m. ET. Members of Mueller Water Products’ leadership team will discuss the Company’s recent financial performance and respond to questions from financial analysts. A live webcast of the call will be available on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website. Please go to the website (www.muellerwaterproducts.com) at least 15 minutes prior to the start of the call to register, download and install any necessary software. A replay of the call will be available for 30 days and can be accessed by dialing 1-866-511-1891. An archive of the webcast will also be available for at least 90 days on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Use of Non-GAAP Measures</strong></p><p class=\"\">In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company’s results as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), the Company also provides non-GAAP information that management believes is useful to investors. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and securities analysts, investors and other interested parties should not consider any of these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP measures that the Company presents as performance measures because management uses these measures to evaluate the Company’s underlying performance on a consistent basis across periods and to make decisions about operational strategies. Management also believes these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of the Company’s recurring performance.</p><p class=\"\">Net debt and net debt leverage are non-GAAP measures that the Company presents as liquidity measures because management uses them to evaluate its capital management and financial position, and the investment community commonly uses them as measures of indebtedness. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP liquidity measure used to assist management and investors in analyzing the Company’s ability to generate liquidity from its operating activities.</p><p class=\"\">The calculations of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to GAAP results are included as an attachment to this press release, which has been posted online at www.muellerwaterproducts.com. The Company does not reconcile forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures, as permitted by Regulation S-K, as certain items, e.g., expenses related to corporate development activities, transactions, pension expenses/(benefits), corporate restructuring and non-cash asset impairment, may have not yet occurred, are out of the Company’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted without unreasonable efforts. Additionally, such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty regarding relevant items that may be confusing to investors. Such items could have a substantial impact on GAAP measures of the Company's financial performance.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Forward-Looking Statements</strong></p><p class=\"\">This press release contains certain statements that may be deemed “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

For example, future hiring and employee turnover may not be reasonably predictable, stock-based compensation expense depends on variables that are largely not within the control of nor predictable by management, such as the market price of 8x8 common stock, and may also be significantly impacted by events like acquisitions, the timing and nature of which are difficult to predict with accuracy. The actual amounts of these excluded items could have a significant impact on the Company's GAAP operating margin and GAAP net income per share, basic and diluted. Accordingly, management believes that reconciliations of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their corresponding GAAP measures are not available without unreasonable effort. See the \"Explanation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\" below for the definition of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP net income per share, basic and diluted.</p><p class=\"\">All projections are on a non-GAAP basis.

Our increased emphasis on profitability and cash flow generation may not be successful. The reduction in our total costs as a percentage of revenue may negatively impact our revenue and our business in ways we do not anticipate and may not achieve the desired outcome.</p><p class=\"\">For a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, see \"Risk Factors\" in the Company's reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, as well as other reports that 8x8, Inc. files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage, and evaluate the business, and to make operating decisions. Management believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating the Company's ongoing operational performance. Management also believes that some of 8x8's investors use these Non-GAAP financial measures as an additional tool in evaluating 8x8's \"core operating performance\" in the ordinary, ongoing, and customary course of the Company's operations. Core operating performance excludes items that are non-cash, not expected to recur, or not reflective of ongoing financial results. Management also believes that looking at the Company's core operating performance provides consistency in period-to-period comparisons and trends.</p><p class=\"\">These Non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies, which limits the usefulness of these measures for comparative purposes. Management recognizes that these Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, including the fact that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of items to exclude from the Non-GAAP financial information. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the table titled \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\". Detailed explanations of the adjustments from comparable GAAP to Non-GAAP financial measures are as follows:</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Costs of Revenue, Costs of Service Revenue and Costs of Other Revenue</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Costs of Revenue includes: (i) Non-GAAP Cost of Service Revenue, which is Cost of Service Revenue excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, and certain severance, transition and contract exit costs; and (ii) Non-GAAP Cost of Other Revenue, which is Cost of Other Revenue excluding stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, and certain severance, transition and contract exit costs.</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Service Revenue Gross Margin, Other Revenue Gross Margin, and Total Revenue Gross Margin</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Service Revenue Gross Profit and Margin as a percentage of Service Revenue and Non-GAAP Other Revenue Gross Profit and Margin as a percentage of Other Revenue are computed as Service Revenue less Non-GAAP Cost of Service Revenue divided by Service Revenue and Other Revenue less Non-GAAP Cost of Other Revenue divided by Other Revenue, respectively. Non-GAAP Total Revenue Gross Profit and Margin as a percentage of Total Revenue is computed as Total Revenue less Non-GAAP Cost of Service Revenue and Non-GAAP Cost of Other Revenue divided by Total Revenue. Management believes the Company's investors benefit from understanding these adjustments and from an alternative view of the Company's Cost of Service Revenue and Cost of Other Revenue, as well as the Company's Service, Other and Total Revenue Gross Margin performance compared to prior periods and trends.</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Operating Profit and Non-GAAP Operating Margin</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Operating Profit excludes: amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, acquisition and integration expenses, certain legal and regulatory costs, certain severance, transition and contract exit costs, and impairment of long-lived assets from Operating Profit (Loss). Non-GAAP Operating Margin is Non-GAAP Operating Profit divided by Revenue. Management believes that these exclusions provide investors with a supplemental view of the Company's ongoing operating performance.</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Net Income excludes: amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, acquisition and integration expenses, certain legal and regulatory costs, certain severance, transition and contract exit costs, impairment of long-lived assets, amortization of debt discount and issuance cost, loss on debt extinguishment, gain on remeasurement of warrants, and other income. Adjusted EBITDA excludes interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation, amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs, and other income (expense), net from non-GAAP net income. Management believes the Company's investors benefit from understanding these adjustments and an alternative view of our net income performance as compared to prior periods and trends.</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share — Basic and Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share - Diluted</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share — Basic is Non-GAAP Net Income divided by the weighted-average basic shares outstanding. Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share — Diluted is Non-GAAP Net Income divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. Diluted shares outstanding include the effect of potentially dilutive securities from stock-based benefit plans and convertible senior notes. These potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of net loss per share attributable to common stockholders on a GAAP basis because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. They are added for the computation of diluted net income per share on a non-GAAP basis in periods when 8x8 has net profit on a non-GAAP basis as their inclusion provides a better indication of 8x8's underlying business performance. Management believes the Company's investors benefit by understanding our Non-GAAP net income performance as reflected in a per share calculation as ways of measuring performance by ownership in the Company. Management believes these adjustments offer investors a useful view of the Company's diluted net income per share as compared to prior periods and trends.</p><p class=\"\">Management evaluates and makes decisions about its business operations based on Non-GAAP financial information by excluding items management does not consider to be \"core costs\" or \"core proceeds.\" Management believes some of its investors also evaluate our \"core operating performance\" as a means of evaluating our performance in the ordinary, ongoing, and customary course of our operations. Management excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets, which primarily represents a non-cash expense of technology and/or customer relationships already developed, to provide a supplemental way for investors to compare the Company's operations pre-acquisition to those post-acquisition and to those of our competitors that have pursued internal growth strategies. Stock-based compensation expense has been excluded because it is a non-cash expense and relies on valuations based on future conditions and events, such as the market price of 8x8 common stock, that are difficult to predict and/or largely not within the control of management. The related employer payroll taxes for stock-based compensation are excluded since they are incurred only due to the associated stock-based compensation expense. Acquisition and integration expenses consist of external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition and strategic investment activities such as legal and other professional services, due diligence, integration, and other closing costs, which are costs that vary significantly in amount and timing. Legal and regulatory costs include litigation and other professional services, as well as certain tax and regulatory liabilities. Severance, transition and contract exit costs include employee termination benefits, executive severance agreements, and cancellation of certain contracts and lease impairments. Debt amortization expenses relate to the non-cash accretion of the debt discount.</p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"> <br/>                               8x8, INC.
