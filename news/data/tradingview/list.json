The U.S. Treasury says it is offering $125 billion in securities to refund around $106.2 billion of notes and bonds maturing this month, while raising around $18.8 billion in new cash. The Treasury warns of greater-than-normal issuance variability until the debt limit is suspended or increased. Stanley says the Treasury's current schedule \"should be fine for most or all of calendar 2025.\" He says coupon auction sizes will likely need to increase.

The Kors brand added too much fashion, alienating core customers. Versace removed too many unique statement items and reduced the number of lower-priced products. Idol says Kors will refocus on its heritage and plans to add a more balanced mix of products, while reducing some prices to be more in line with historical levels. Versace will add more products at the lower end of its price range to appeal to a broader base of consumers.

The risk of sovereign debt crises, currency devaluations and systemic financial instability could further reinforce this trend, increasing the attractiveness of metals as a hedge against economic turbulence, Hansen writes. A shift away from U.S. dollar dominance is also underway as nations seek to reduce their greenback reliance for trade and reserve holdings, Hansen says.

While investors have some more details on his tariff plans since then — and the near-miss to start February — in many ways, the trade landscape remains just as uncertain. </p><p class=\"\">As a consequence, BMO expects front-running ahead of tariffs will add additional noise to the data until tariffs are implemented or their threat dissipates. </p><p class=\"\">Exports jumped 4.9% month over month, their largest increase in almost a year. Growth was broad-based but led by energy (+9.5%, partially on higher prices) and metal and non-metallic mineral products (+9.2%). Meantime, imports rose 2.3%, again with increases across most product categories. </p><p class=\"\">In volume terms, exports increased 11.6% a.r. while imports were up 8.6% a.r. in Q4. It looks like trade will add to Q4 gross domestic product growth when investors get the latter report at the end of the month, pointed out the bank. </p><p class=\"\">Separately, the services trade shortfall narrowed from C$443 million to C$67 million in December, its smallest gap since entering deficit territory in late summer. Canada's overall trade balance — goods plus services — improved from a C$1.4 billion deficit to a C$600 million surplus in December. </p><p class=\"\">Canada's normally volatile trade figures are subject to even more noise given tariff uncertainty at the turn of the year, stated BMO. Tariff front-running likely contributed to December's increase in trade activity, with the weaker Canadian dollar (CAD or loonie) providing a helping hand, supporting economic growth to end 2024. </p><p class=\"\">The bank wouldn't be surprised if the early 2025 trade figures are subject to heightened volatility, not unlike broader financial markets, as investors await more certainty on the U.S. trade tariff front.</p></span></div>",
