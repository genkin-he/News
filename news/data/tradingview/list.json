            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Alexander Saeedy</p><p class=\"\">Elizabeth Warren agrees with President Trump about something.</p><p class=\"\">The Democratic senator from Massachusetts told Trump on Tuesday that she thinks the White House should take action to stop what she said were discriminatory practices by the country's biggest banks, according to a letter from her office that was viewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p class=\"\">Trump brought the subject to the fore last month when he suggested at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase were unfairly closing conservatives' bank accounts.</p><p class=\"\">Those comments set off a political firestorm and the Senate Banking Committee convened a hearing on the matter for Wednesday.</p><p class=\"\">Warren said that her office has identified thousands of examples of consumers losing access to their bank accounts and that she wants the president to take action to stop the practice.</p><p class=\"\">\"There are times when a bank has a legitimate reason, and a legal obligation, to freeze or close a bank account,\" Warren wrote in her letter to the White House, ahead of the Senate Banking Committee hearing. \"But banks may be implementing these legal obligations in a sloppy and overbroad manner.\"</p><p class=\"\">Banks say they don't discriminate against customers on the basis of their backgrounds or beliefs. They are required by law to report suspicious activity to regulators, and they face the risk of fines and litigation if they don't close accounts with ties to criminal activity. But unexplained account closures have led conservative groups and crypto firms to allege that many Americans are being unfairly targeted.</p><p class=\"\">\"Banks are required to manage risk and satisfy their regulators, which can also restrict banks from sharing why an account has been closed,\" said Austin Anton, a spokesman for the Bank Policy Institute, an industry group for American banks. \"An important part of the solution is fixing the regulatory structure.\"</p><p class=\"\">Warren's alignment with Trump shows a growing coalition across party lines that wants to try to stop unfair account closures.</p><p class=\"\">Conservative criticism of banks has been building since banks embraced diversity policies after the murder of George Floyd in 2020. A Republican-led committee in Congress alleged that banks profiled conservative and religious Americans as potential domestic terrorists when they turned over information about thousands of customers after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.</p><p class=\"\">Progressives have their own gripes with the banking industry. Warren in her letter said the banks have been unfairly shutting down accounts linked to formerly incarcerated individuals or on the basis of their customers' religion.</p><p class=\"\">Warren identified more than 8,000 regulatory complaints from consumers who alleged their bank accounts were improperly closed over the past three years. She said most of the closures were by the four biggest U.S. banks: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo.</p><p class=\"\">She said the best way for the president to take action was to support the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal agency she helped design in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent took over as the agency's acting director and halted its enforcement and rule-making actions.</p><p class=\"\">Warren also said the White House could join with the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and other regulators to adjust anti-money-laundering rules that could be causing improper account closures.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Alexander Saeedy at alexander.saeedy@wsj.com</p></span></div>",

Customers search for car shipping companies, check prices, discuss solutions and then book their service. Customer software is a must and why Corsia has released its new price calculator and online booking system - to answer customers' needs.</p><p class=\"\">ST. PETERSBURG, FLORIDA / ACCESS Newswire / February 5, 2025 / For over a decade, Corsia Logistics has been a trusted name in vehicle shipping, serving private and business customers across the U.S. and internationally. Since 2013, the team has upheld a five-star reputation by delivering exceptional customer service and reliable transport solutions. To further enhance its offerings, Corsia is launching a custom car shipping cost calculator and online booking system. This innovative software is designed to accurately predict prices and simplify the reservation process, reaffirming Corsia's commitment to outstanding service and realistic market prices.<span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:865.3521126760563px;aspect-ratio:1.4422535211267606\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025-02-05:newsml_ACSl4Zc0a-59f5dcccb0ada447a9b470dbe4e09491-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"Corsia car shipping\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025-02-05:newsml_ACSl4Zc0a-59f5dcccb0ada447a9b470dbe4e09491-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#948075\"/></picture></div></figure></span></p><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Corsia car shipping</strong><p class=\"\">Shipping a Lamborghini Aventador - enclosed auto transport</p><p class=\"\">A car shipping cost calculator must account for a range of variables that influence pricing. The process begins with factors like distance and the type of car carrier, followed by the vehicle's type and condition. Crucial details such as pick-up and delivery locations and the desired shipping time frame also play a significant role. Corsia's car shipping cost calculator goes a step further by incorporating the exact make and model of each vehicle, a key factor in determining a realistic and accurate price. By leveraging a detailed database where every make and model is meticulously price-marked, Corsia ensures its quotes are among the most accurate in the market.</p><p class=\"\">The next feature of Corsia's software is the online booking system, which presents customers with two pricing options upon receiving a quote. The first option, the 'Discounted Cash Price,' allows customers to pay only a reservation fee upfront and the remaining balance upon delivery to the carrier. The second option, the 'Regular Price,' enables customers to pay the full amount online at the time of booking. Importantly, the system does not require immediate payment; a card is simply placed on file. This allows customers the freedom to switch from cash price or regular price at any time before a car carrier is assigned.</p><p class=\"\">ABOUT CORSIA</p><p class=\"\">Corsia is a nationwide auto transport company servicing all states, including Alaska and Hawaii. Corsia offers free vehicle shipping quotes and reliable services. Since 2013, the company has earned the trust of thousands of private and business customers from across the country.

Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires throughout the day.</p><p class=\"\">0450 ET - Base metal prices are mixed, with LME three-month copper flat at $9,174 a metric ton and LME three-month aluminum down 0.5% at $2,615 a ton. Metal prices rebounded on-week as the U.S. pushed back Canadian and Mexican tariffs one month, but trade tensions and global growth risks are still pressing, RBC Capital Markets' Sam Crittenden says. The U.S. imposed another Chinese import tariff of 10%, while China retaliated with fresh levies, including critical mineral export restrictions. President Trump and China's President Xi will talk over the coming days and U.S. tariffs won't be implemented until Feb. 10, so they could strike a deal before implementation, Crittenden writes. Tariff uncertainty has prompted a significant disconnect between LME and U.S. commodities exchange Comex copper pricing, with the market factoring in more potential trade disputes, the analyst adds. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0337 ET - The Canadian dollar rises to a two-week high against the U.S. dollar as it continues to recover after President Trump agreed to pause a 25% tariff on Canada, ING's Francesco Pesole says in a note. The Canadian dollar could rise further if tariff risks are entirely priced out, he says. There is a residual 1% risk premium embedded into USD/CAD. \"That said, we are not sure markets will or should move to a completely optimistic stance on the U.S.-Canada trade spat.\" There are no clear hints Canada will be spared from another round of potential universal tariffs. USD/CAD could fall to 1.42 in the short-term but risks remain skewed to 1.45 this summer. USD/CAD falls to a low of 1.4289. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1828 ET - Are China's 15% tariffs on U.S. coal meaningful for coal markets? That's the question posed by Morgan Stanley, which concludes any impact would be mostly be felt in metallurgical coal prices. Commodities strategist Helen Amos says China accounts for a relatively small share of U.S. coal exports. Still, U.S. exports of thermal and metallurgical coal to China increased over 2024. Morgan Stanley estimates tariffs would raise costs for around 3.4 million tons of thermal coal, representing less than 1% of traded volumes, and around 10.7 million tons of metallurgical coal, or some 3% of traded volumes. \"We see negligible or only modest potential price impact of China's coal import tariffs, given both coal markets are currently well supplied,\" Morgan Stanley says. \"But we watch for more meaningful shifts in met coal trade flows.\" (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)</p><p class=\"\">1711 ET - Mexican chain Chipotle Mexican Grill is known for its guacamole, and is working to source its avocados and other supplies beyond Mexico to keep providing it. The company said in a 4Q earnings call that it now sources goods from Colombia, Peru and the Dominican Republic, with half of its avocados coming from Mexico. Tariffs on supplies from Mexico are a looming threat for U.S. companies. Chipotle said it would have a financial hit if the tariffs come to pass. (heather.haddon@wsj.com; @heatherhaddon)</p><p class=\"\">1517 ET - Oil futures put in a mixed performance with Chinese retaliatory tariffs on U.S. LNG and oil pressuring U.S. benchmark crude. WTI settles down 0.6% at $72.70 a barrel, while international benchmark Brent edges up 0.3% to $76.20 a barrel. The Chinese tariff on $5 billion of U.S. energy imports suggests a \"softer tone of the response\" to the U.S. tariffs, Alex Hodes of StoneX says in a note. \"The tariffs are also not expected to come into play until Feb. 10, leaving room for negotiations between the two nations.\" (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1424 ET - Gold jumps to a record high, with the front-month contract rising 0.7% to $2,853.30 a troy ounce. The move keeps gold's positive momentum going, after it recorded net outflows in last week's trading, according to data from JPMorgan Global Commodities Research. The firm says that for the week ended Jan. 31, open interest in precious metals fell 4.6%, or by $11.3 billion. The firm attributes the decline to outflows in gold contracts, but uncertainty around trade tariffs is pushing investors back into the safe haven asset. Year-to-date, continuous gold futures have risen nearly 9%. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1252 ET - Tariffs would certainly dampen Ball's current outlook, Chief Executive Dan Fisher says on a call with analysts. The aluminum-can maker has spent the better part of the last few weeks renegotiating deals with its Chinese aluminum suppliers in an attempt to mitigate a $40 million to $50 million issue, he says: \"I think we've got that resolved down to a couple million dollars.\" The larger concern now revolves around consumer sentiment. Consumers are already pretty stressed, Fisher says, adding that higher costs stemming from a 25% tariff would stifle demand and be a headwind to growth. Shares fall 8% after Ball reports a decline in 4Q sales and logs a loss. (connor.hart@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1149 ET - Base metal prices rise, with LME three-month copper up 0.5% at $9,158.50 a metric ton and LME three-month aluminum up 0.6% at $2,636.50 a ton. The market has bounced back from losses incurred by President Trump's proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which have been postponed a month after last-minute agreements on Monday. An additional 10% China tariff has proceeded. This has eased market worries of reduced industrial growth and demand. Canada and Mexico are significant suppliers to the U.S. across the whole base-metals complex, ranging from around 20% of copper imports to nearly half of its aluminum imports. News of the delay also sent the U.S. dollar lower, a tailwind for metals as it becomes cheaper for international buyers to purchase dollar-denominated commodities. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1141 ET - Gold futures rise, having set a fresh record slightly earlier in the session. Futures are up 0.5% at $2,871.60 a troy ounce, having peaked at $2,874.50 in European late afternoon trading. The precious metal has traded in a relatively narrow range, with rising U.S. bond yields and a stronger dollar limiting the upward rally, XS.com's Rania Gule says in a note. That said, concerns about potential economic fallout from President Trump's tariffs and other inflationary policies provide strong support for gold as a safe-haven asset, Gule writes. The overall upward trend for gold remains intact, and any corrective pullbacks should be seen as buying opportunities as supportive factors haven't fundamentally changed, Gule says. As markets remain uncertain, gold will likely stay a focus for investors both as a hedge and an investment opportunity, Gule adds. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1056 ET - Shares of big food companies dip after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. clears a Senate Finance Committee vote on his prospective leadership of Health and Human Services. While Kennedy said he supported vaccines in his Senate testimony, aiming to calm concerns over some of his past criticisms, he reiterated concerns about processed foods, which he's blamed for exacerbating chronic disease. Kraft Heinz recently down 2.3%, with other food stocks like Campbell's, JM Smucker and General Mills down around 2%. ( jacob.bunge@wsj.com; @jacobbunge)</p><p class=\"\">1031 ET - Century Communities expects tariffs to have a greater impact on the remodel market, says Executive VP Jim Francescon in an interview. The Denver home builder adds that it's continuing to work with its suppliers but stressed that things remain fluid. \"Typically suppliers will keep a number of months of supply on hand. So if this is just a short-term negotiating tactic, the new home builders may not even feel it,\" says Francescon. While the U.S. paused plans for 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for one month, a 10% levy on imports from China went into effect today. Shares rise 2.2% to $76.29, recouping most of the previous sessions losses. (denny.jacob@wsj.com; @pennedbyden)</p><p class=\"\">1010 ET - Lean hog futures on the CME are higher in early trading, with the most-active contract up 0.8%. Traders appear to be pulling back from the steep selling seen to start the week, with contract limits in today's session extended to 6 cents a pound after the limit-down close Monday, following a drop of 4 cents a pound. While the hog market recalibrates amid tariff turmoil, there exists fundamental pressure points for hog demand. Pork carcass cutout prices shed 94 cents per hundredweight on Monday, according to USDA data, following a strong start to 2025 pricewise. Live cattle futures are down 0.2%.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">The Union Budget gave markets some good news and some bad news. The tax breaks came as a huge positive surprise while the muted capex spending target for FY26 came as a bit of a dampener. While the proposals have brought hopes of a bounce back in earnings for FY26, stocks are still not dancing to an upbeat mood as uncertainty around Trump policy and quarterly results seem to be weighing them down. Neelkanth Mishra, Chief Economist, Axis Bank and an authoritative voice in India’s economic policy-making spoke to Moneycontrol exclusively on a wide range of questions on the economy and markets. Edited excerpts:</p><p class=\"\">What changes after the budget from a market perspective?</p><p class=\"\">Not much. The only surprise was that the government found the space for one lakh rupees in tax cuts. The COVID bump in deficits has largely been moved out. By FY 2031, the target for debt-to-GDP is expected to range between 48% to 52% from the current 56%. In the worst case, the government may not consolidate much further, but in the best case, we could see a reduction of 15-20 basis points per year. But overall, the aggressive pace of fiscal consolidation is over. For markets, nothing changes. The improvement in fiscal certainty may justify a slightly higher P/E multiple.</p><p class=\"\">Were you surprised at the muted FY26 capex target?</p><p class=\"\">Comparing FY 2019 to FY 2026, two key changes are that personal income tax-to-GDP and capital expenditure-to-GDP have both increased. The problem the government is facing is the lack of absorptive capacity for central government capex. The government can only spend on national highways, railways, defense, telecom, major ports, and airports, but most of these sectors don’t require much capex anymore. That’s the reason they decided to return some of the extra funds to taxpayers instead of distorting the economy further.</p><p class=\"\">This is assumed to boost overall consumption – will it?</p><p class=\"\">I don’t think so. The fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP falls from 4.8% to 4.4%. The government is actually being a drag on growth by reducing aggregate demand. Capital expenditure as a percentage of GDP is going to remain flat. Forget about the earlier projections; the government’s actual expenditure is already behind the curve. In the first nine months of the year, even with the revised down estimates, government expenditure was low. However, in the last three months, government capex grew by 21% year-on-year, and in December, capex was up 95% year-on-year. So, aggregate expenditure will decrease as a percentage of GDP, so consumption is not likely to get a boost. I’m quite surprised by how the market seems to be interpreting this.But taxpayers are getting this extra money from tax savings, which will trigger consumption…</p><p class=\"\">Personal income tax-to-GDP is still expected to increase by FY 2026, despite the tax cuts. From a market perspective, how the 70-75 lakh people who fall in the Rs 12 lakh to Rs 50 lakh tax bracket and are the biggest beneficiaries of these tax cuts, will use that discretionary income.</p><p class=\"\">Which areas will see an uptick in consumption?</p><p class=\"\">These people are in the 90th percentile of Indian households. For them, their consumption is focused less on staples and more on high-value discretionary items. While it’s not considered part of household consumption expenditure, the real estate market will likely benefit. While some of this boost will go into savings, a significant portion will also likely be spent on purchases like cars, jewelry, etc. The effect on staples or other consumption categories might not be significant.Strangely, banks have not responded positively.</p><p class=\"\">One reason for that could be the uncertainty around the global economy. For banks, the bigger issue right now is the uncertainty surrounding monetary policy. There’s a lot of market expectation for rate cuts in the upcoming MPC meeting, but I personally think it would be premature to cut rates now, as it might undermine the credibility of inflation-fighting efforts.</p><p class=\"\">Do you think \"animal spirits\" in private investments can really come back this year?</p><p class=\"\">It’s essential to understand why investment fell in the first place. Gross fixed capital formation, which measures investment activity, fell from 34% in 2012 to 27% in 2021. A significant portion of this decline, around 5%, was due to reduced household investment in real estate. A large part of the rest was power sector investments and manufacturing that feeds into real estate. If we break it down, the downturn in the real estate and power generation sectors was a primary factor in this (falling investments). These cycles are now starting to turn around, which could drive growth.</p><p class=\"\">The government’s fiscal slowdown during the election year also played a role, but spending is starting to pick up now. On the other hand, the central bank’s tightening on credit-deposit ratios inadvertently slowed overall credit growth. While it was necessary to control certain segments of the credit market, the broader slowdown from 17% to 11% growth in credit was problematic. If we can reverse that trend, the growth outlook could improve significantly. The key to reviving private-sector capex is ensuring enough liquidity in the system, as the underlying demand trends are supportive. However, global turbulence still poses a significant risk.</p><p class=\"\">Going back to capex, have themes like roads and railways run their course from a stock perspective?</p><p class=\"\">The railway sector can indeed see significant growth in spending. If you recall, in 2014, the plan was to increase spending from around half a trillion to 2.5-3 trillion rupees by 2019. But the issue with railways is its bureaucracy. It’s historically struggled to execute large contracts and tenders. That said, there’s been a push for process improvements within the railway ministry. They’re starting to tackle these challenges, and the capacity to absorb more spending is improving. Moving from spending Rs 1-1.5 lakh crores per year to 2.5 lakh crores is a big leap. There’s potential for unlocking an additional Rs 10-11 trillion in projects. The primary challenge here is not fiscal capacity or funds, but the railways’ ability to execute these projects efficiently.</p><p class=\"\">How about power?</p><p class=\"\">The announcements for power capacity have already been made, but investments have just begun. For the next 3-5 years, the focus should be on urban infrastructure, which is gaining traction. The budget allocates a significant amount, with the potential to trigger up to Rs 4 lakh crores in capex through competition among states. This is a clear area for growth. Within industrials, the focus will shift to construction – like machinery, materials, cement, etc. – rather than manufacturing. With excess capacity in China, the likelihood of very large, capital-intensive projects coming up in India is slim… other than maybe in strategic areas like semiconductors. But, mostly, if we do get manufacturing, it will be labour-intensive manufacturing.</p><p class=\"\">How do you interpret the impact of Trump tariffs on Indian markets?There are so many moving parts and so many layers… but overall, it’s not good for anyone. If anyone is under any illusion that these tariffs somehow help India, I think they are mistaken. Normal wars, while they are very bad for lives and livelihoods in some specific areas, can actually be a boost to the economy. The First World War, for three or four years, was a big boost to the US economy. The Second World War also, because most of the damage happened in Europe, they actually benefited from trade. But, these are wars where the objective is economic damage. You see even the US government statements; they say that they are willing to accept some damage. In fact, there are theoreticians who are saying that this is like mutually assured destruction.</p><p class=\"\">So the first thing is, this hurts everyone. It’s bad for growth. Secondly, there is involuntary contraction because, as prices go up, demand falls. The third is just the uncertainty -- if you're setting up a factory anywhere in the world, you would say, 'You know what, let me hold back.'</p><p class=\"\">As for foreign selling in Indian markets, will it continue in this environment?</p><p class=\"\">Yes, so the dollar strengthening is not so much because of any expectations on the balance of payment changes. Frankly, that's too hard to forecast at this stage. Yeah, but it's just de-risking. People want to get into safe assets, or what was considered to be safe assets 20 years ago. So these are muscle memories of the markets that whenever there is uncertainty, you dump all the speculative back of the dollar, and then money goes back to the dollar and to gold. I mean, gold is behaving much better, which again, shows that people are really becoming risk-averse. So that is the strength of the dollar, which I think will be temporary. Once some certainty emerges, and people see how this dust may settle, which could take three to six months, then, this reversal starts as well. Because, as you were rightly saying, this is contra to what the US government really wants.</p><p class=\"\">What's your take on Indian markets for 2025?</p><p class=\"\">The first thing is the headline, I don't think we will go anywhere, although I do expect that the underlying earnings will keep improving. We will see a time correction that we've been anticipating now. I was maybe 10 months too early in calling for a peak; the market ran for a lot longer. But now the potential growth acceleration in India is now behind us, a P/E expansion is unlikely. What has also happened is that given the high prices, the supply of equity is very high. So even this year, there is going to be seven and a half lakh crores of supply in terms of promoter selling, IPOs, block trades, etc., whereas the demand is only about six lakh crores. So, on both these fronts, the PE multiple doesn't go anywhere. The enhanced global uncertainty means that the PE multiples come off even more.The underlying demand or the earnings should grow because demand drivers are largely domestic. This is the headline approach. But if something really bad happens in the trade war, maybe there is a deeper swoon in the market correction, that should be bought into. But within sectors, I would say that the channel through which growth can really be boosted is credit. Because, there is not much scope for fiscal action. Given elevated inflation, there is not much scope for interest rates to come down. But there is a lot more scope to get credit growth back closer to where it was before the slowdown started. And so, the channel for that would be the financials.</p></span></div>",
