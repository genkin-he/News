The company's U.S. business jumped 52% from a year earlier. \"Our business results continue to astound, demonstrating our deepening position at the center of the (artificial intelligence) revolution. Our early insights surrounding the commoditization of large language models have evolved from theory to fact,\" said CEO Alex Karp. For the first quarter, Palantir said it expects revenue of $858 million to $862 million, up 36% from 2024 at the midpoint and better than Wall Street estimates of $799 million.</p><p class=\"\">Tesla  was up 0.2% after shares of the electric-vehicle giant slumped 5.2% on Monday. The stock closed lower after it was announced that tariffs levied on Mexico by the U.S. would be delayed by a month but before President Donald Trump struck a similar deal with Canada.

Shares fell 4.2%.</p><p class=\"\">Shares of Spotify Technology jumped 10% after the audio-streaming company added more premium subscribers in the fourth quarter than Wall Street expected, helping revenue top estimates.</p><p class=\"\">Merck fell 11% after the drug maker reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings that beat analysts' estimates but issued guidance for f2025 that missed expectations. Merck said it expects 2025 adjusted earnings of $8.88 to $9.03 a share, below consensus of $9.21.</p><p class=\"\">Pfizer was down 2.1.

And while we agree that there are important budget implications to this policy, it is also critically important to extend public protections of the regulated medical market we’ve created to the adult use marketplace.</p><p class=\"\">“It is undeniable that there is a cannabis marketplace in every town in America, with the only question being whether or not that market is regulated. A regulated cannabis market limits sales by age, clearly marks packaging, is subject to rigorous oversight and provides the public with a safe and thoroughly tested product. And yes, it also takes funding from criminal enterprises and puts it into state coffers. The status quo in our Commonwealth fails to do all those things.</p><p class=\"\">“Legalizing cannabis for adult use is a common-sense policy supported by over 60% of the public, and even opponents prefer a regulated market to the status quo.

They're looking for practical, proven ways to grow and advance their mission.\"</p><p class=\"\">\"After years of searching, we believe we've found a solution: the Altruist Impact Accelerator-a program that's proven its ability to transform organizations into scalable agents of change. Together, we aim to reach 25,000 nonprofits over the next five years through their accessible, affordable platform. It could not come at a better time, and if we do this right, we will make a transformative impact and unleash a wave of social progress.\"</p><p class=\"\">The Altruist Impact Accelerator, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in 2022, is a low-cost, open-access learning community that provides nonprofit executives, staff, and board members a clear, step-by-step pathway for planning, financing, and executing ambitious social change efforts, regardless of mission or location.</p><p class=\"\">\"We've been working with hundreds of nonprofits around the world over the past 15 years to develop this integrated learning curriculum,\" says Donald Summers, Altruist Accelerator Founder and Executive Director. \"Until now, nonprofit leaders have had to piece together disconnected advice on governance, program evaluation, fundraising, hiring, team building, and other key management areas. What we've done is integrate everything into a step-by-step process that any organization can follow to dramatically increase their performance and service delivery. The Accelerator includes tools, templates, real-world examples and a supportive community of experts to help with implementation. This is what the social sector needs: a self-paced, low-cost solution to scaling impact.\"</p><p class=\"\">\"We used the Altruist process to create levels of educational success for foster youth that were considered impossible,\" says Janis Avery, former Executive Director of Treehouse and Vice Chair of the Altruist Accelerator Board of Directors, whose story is featured in the book \"Scaling Altruism: A Proven Pathway for Accelerating Nonprofit Growth and Impact\"(Wiley, 2024). \"We worked for years with many different experts to improve the stubbornly low rates of high school graduation among foster youth. It wasn't until we applied the practices detailed in ‘Scaling Altruism' that we not just moved the needle, but closed the graduation gap almost entirely. We hope other nonprofit leaders take advantage of this proven approach.\"</p><p class=\"\">\"I encourage those who react with skepticism to the Accelerator's bold promise of nonprofit transformation to consider the program's track record,\" says Akhtar Badshah, Distinguished Professor of Social Impact at the University of Washington and Board Chair of the Altruist Accelerator. \"This methodology has been painstakingly developed over two decades of practice. It delivers a median annual increase of revenue and program impact of 25%. It's not easy, and it is only for tenacious nonprofit leaders ready to learn a new set of entrepreneurial practices. But it works. This is a toolkit for nonprofit growth and impact.\"</p><p class=\"\">The Accelerator's self-paced training is provided in an online community where nonprofit staff, leaders and board members follow a carefully sequenced series of organizational development and growth practices and apply them to their unique organizational contexts. They develop business plans, financial models, pitch decks, program evaluation dashboards, and other tools that are taught in leading business schools and for-profit accelerators, all adapted for use in the nonprofit sector.</p><p class=\"\">\"Combine all the rigor of a Harvard MBA with a self-paced, supportive process tailored for busy executives at small nonprofits, and you have an idea of what we are doing,\" Summers says. \"There is nothing like it. The more nonprofits that follow this program, the more social problems we will solve.\"</p><p class=\"\">Suited for organizations ranging in size from start-ups to about $25 million in annual funding, the Accelerator is now open to any nonprofit employee, executive or board member.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Kate King</p><p class=\"\">Amazon.com, the largest e-commerce retailer in the U.S., is stumbling in its efforts to compete in the bricks-and-mortar world.</p><p class=\"\">The company in 2018 launched the Amazon Go convenience store, where customers can grab a latte, bagel or turkey sandwich and walk out without waiting in line to pay. Amazon charges them electronically.</p><p class=\"\">But with the Amazon Go store in Woodland Hills, Calif., closing this month, the retailer has shrunk its Go portfolio by about half since early 2023, to 16 stores in four states. Instead, Amazon is focusing on licensing its \"Just Walk Out\" technology to other retailers, while it focuses its bricks-and-mortar ambitions on grocery stores.</p><p class=\"\">This is hardly Amazon's only misfire in the physical-store universe. It has closed dozens of its other branded retail stores in recent years, including bookstores, fashion outlets and its \"4-star\" locations stocked with bestselling items from its website.</p><p class=\"\">After a decadelong experiment with bricks-and-mortar stores, Amazon's dominance online has yet to translate into a successful strategy for connecting with shoppers in the real world, retail brokers and landlords said.</p><p class=\"\">\"They keep testing these concepts thinking one of them is going to connect with the consumer in a big way,\" said Jeff Edison, chief executive of Phillips Edison &amp; Co., a real-estate investor that owns grocery-anchored shopping centers. \"But can you think of any examples where they've actually done the bricks-and-mortar retail well? I can't.\"</p><p class=\"\">Amazon Go stores were launched to develop technology that speeds up the buying process while saving on labor costs. They use cameras and sensors to track customer purchases instead of a traditional checkout counter.</p><p class=\"\">But reducing the number of employees available to help customers and giving priority to credit-card payments over cash limits sales and makes the shopping experience more cumbersome, said Nick Egelanian, president of retail-advisory firm SiteWorks Retail.</p><p class=\"\">\"I don't think they really understand retail,\" Egelanian said. \"Running warehouses and shipping stuff efficiently is not the same as greeting a customer and saying, 'May I help you?'\"</p><p class=\"\">An Amazon spokeswoman said Go store employees greet customers at the door, restock shelves and are available to answer questions.</p><p class=\"\">While certain locations work better than others, the company continues to invest in its Go stores, including a recent redesign of its suburban store in Mill Creek, Wash., where it added more items such as made-to-order pizza. Amazon also opened a new Go store in Bellevue, Wash., last summer.</p><p class=\"\">\"Amazon aims to provide customers outstanding selection, value, and convenience when shopping for groceries and everyday essentials both online and in physical stores,\" Amazon spokeswoman Jessica Martin said.</p><p class=\"\">And while Amazon is tops for online revenue, its sales at bricks-and-mortar stores, including Whole Foods Market, have grown annually since 2021 as well as in the first nine months of 2024, according to the company's financial filings. Net sales in the third quarter of 2024 topped $5.2 billion, compared with about $61.4 billion at Amazon's online store.</p><p class=\"\">But Amazon Go competes in a crowded field. There are more than 152,000 convenience stores in the U.S., according to industry group NACS, many of which also sell coffee, alcohol and freshly prepared food.</p><p class=\"\">Amazon seemed to hedge its bets on Go from the start, making sure it wasn't locked into locations long term.</p><p class=\"\">The company negotiated hard for short-term leases or those with early-exit provisions, said Ed Coury, senior managing director at retail-advisory firm RCS Real Estate Advisors, who worked on a deal to open a 4-Star location at the Westfield Topanga mall in California. He calls that a \"risk averse\" approach to real estate.</p><p class=\"\">Developing and testing its Just Walk Out technology capabilities was a driving reason behind Amazon's rollout of its Go concept, Coury said, and as the technology improved the stores were less necessary.</p><p class=\"\">Amazon now licenses its Just Walk Out technology to more than 200 retailers, including colleges and universities, sports arenas, hospitals and airports. This allows it to profit by marketing the technology without the cost burden of operating a store.</p><p class=\"\">\"It was an investment well spent in developing technology,\" Coury said. \"But the growth plans that they had for that brand are over.\"</p><p class=\"\">Amazon's bricks-and-mortar retail strategy now seems to be focused on its grocery portfolio.</p><p class=\"\">The company acquired Whole Foods Market for roughly $13.5 billion in 2017 and last week announced that the grocer's chief executive, Jason Buechel, is now in charge of all grocery operations for Amazon, including its Fresh and Go stores.</p><p class=\"\">Amazon is moving forward with plans to open more locations for Amazon Fresh, which offers a more mass-market selection with often cheaper prices than upscale Whole Foods, after pausing expansion to overhaul the in-store experience. The stores have replaced its Just Walk Out technology with \"dash carts,\" where shoppers scan items before placing them in the cart.</p><p class=\"\">Amazon's changes to its Fresh stores have improved the shopping experience there, Egelanian said, though he feels the banner is still searching for a niche in the crowded grocery landscape.</p><p class=\"\">Martin said that \"providing customers with groceries and everyday essentials online and in store is a top priority for Amazon, and we plan to continue investing and innovating for customers in this area.\"</p><p class=\"\">Write to Kate King at kate.king@wsj.com</p></span></div>",

Of course. That would be prudent. But it's worth noting that the mining stocks could have more room to run if gold prices keep climbing. And that seems very plausible.</p><p class=\"\">It appears that both foreign central banks and retail investors are fueling the rally. Poland, Turkey, India, and China have been big buyers, according to data from late last year from the World Gold Council.</p><p class=\"\">\"Emerging market banks are very committed to gold and well positioned to purchase more. Strategically, they will continue to be buyers,\" said Joe Cavatoni, senior markets strategist with the World Gold Council, in an interview with Barron's.</p><p class=\"\">It's all about the Trump trade war. The continued surge in gold is a bit unusual since it's happening at a time when the U.S. dollar is also strengthening.</p><p class=\"\">Frank Watson, a markets analyst for Kinesis Money, pointed out that a surging greenback is \"normally a bearish element for dollar-denominated gold prices,\" but he added that \"gold's safe haven appeal remains undiminished amid uncertainty over the economic and inflationary effects of expected US trade tariffs.\" In other words, Trump trade policies may trump the usual impact a strong dollar has on gold.</p><p class=\"\">Silver prices have been climbing too, rising about 13% so far this year. Alex Ebkarian, chief operating officer of physical precious metals dealer Allegiance Gold, said in an email to Barron's that the prices of both metals should keep climbing due to the market uncertainty.</p><p class=\"\">\"In a high-risk environment, the appeal of physical gold and silver becomes even more pronounced, as they eliminate counterparty risk and provide a reliable store of value,\" he said, adding that the recent move by JPMorgan Chase to deliver about $4 billion worth in gold futures is \"an apparent hedge against potential trade disruptions.\"</p><p class=\"\">So how much higher could gold go? Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for State Street's SPDR Business, thinks gold could top $3,000 an ounce sometime this year due to all that's happening on the worldwide landscape.</p><p class=\"\">\"Geopolitical risks and structural transitions in monetary and fiscal policies should also boost the prospects for gold,\" Arone wrote. \"Central bank purchases throughout the year will likely continue to support gold's price. All that could finally unleash some pent up investment demand from investors chasing last year's record gold prices.\"</p><p class=\"\">That should be good news as well for the mining stocks, which despite their big run already this year, remain reasonably valued. The VanEck Gold Miners ETF is trading for just 12 times 2025 earnings estimates, lower than its 5-year average of 15. It's also trading at about a price-to-earnings ratio that is 45% below the S&amp;P 500, much steeper than its usual 20% discount to the broader market.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Paul R.

The aluminum-can maker has spent the better part of the last few weeks renegotiating deals with its Chinese aluminum suppliers in an attempt to mitigate a $40 million to $50 million issue, he says: \"I think we've got that resolved down to a couple million dollars.\" The larger concern now revolves around consumer sentiment. Consumers are already pretty stressed, Fisher says, adding that higher costs stemming from a 25% tariff would stifle demand and be a headwind to growth. Shares fall 8% after Ball reports a decline in 4Q sales and logs a loss. (connor.hart@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
