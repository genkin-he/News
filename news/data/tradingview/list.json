            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Angela Palumbo</p><p class=\"\">Smartphones, laptops, and other electronics devices could get pricier thanks to tariffs.</p><p class=\"\">President Donald Trump announced over the weekend that he would be implementing 10% tariffs on China and 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Mexican and Canadian tariffs were paused on Monday following talks with those countries' leaders, but the levies on China went into effect overnight into Tuesday.</p><p class=\"\">China has responded by announcing import taxes of 15% on U.S. crude oil, machinery, and some cars, and a 10% increase of tariffs on coal and liquefied natural gas.</p><p class=\"\">Tariffs are taxes that are charged onto goods being imported from other countries. Companies that bring in goods from these impacted countries pay those taxes to the government. It's common for those companies to pass the increased costs from tariffs onto the consumer through higher prices. This time around, a 10% tariff on China — a country where many components and products come from — is likely to lead to higher priced phones, laptops, and more.</p><p class=\"\">According to a report from the Consumer Technology Association in January, tariffs on technology products could lead to a $90 billion to $143 billion decline in U.S. consumer purchasing power.</p><p class=\"\">\"If these tariffs are sticky and they continue to hold on, then I think the time frame for the permanent price escalation is after six to 12 months, when we're going to see that, hey, everything's more expensive,\" Jim Cagnina, senior market analyst at NinjaTrader, told Barron's.</p><p class=\"\">Just a few of the companies that could feel impacts from tariffs include chip company Intel and PC maker Dell Technologies along with smartphone giant Apple. Some of these consumer electronic makers have already spoken about what tariffs could mean for them.</p><p class=\"\">\"We're reviewing the tariff executive orders and subsequent government announcements to understand how they may affect our customers, partners and our business,\" Dell said in a statement to Barron's.</p><p class=\"\">Intel and Apple didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p class=\"\">Intel reported fourth-quarter revenue of $14.3 billion on Jan. 30, which was higher than Wall Street estimates. On the company's fourth-quarter earnings call, interim co-CEO David Zinsner said that \"we expect a portion of Q4 revenue upside was due to customers hedging against potential tariffs.\"</p><p class=\"\">But Intel also provided disappointing revenue guidance for the current quarter. Zinsner said this was due to \"added pressure coming from macro uncertainty especially around tariffs, balancing of PC inventory and increasing competition.\"</p><p class=\"\">As the China tariffs kicked in on Tuesday, shares of Apple were up 1.7%, while Intel stock was down 0.1% and Dell was up 1.6%.</p><p class=\"\">The trade dynamic could be a problem for an already weakened PC market, which saw demand decline after the Covid-19 pandemic fueled purchases of at-home devices. Companies have been pushing out new AI powered PCs to try to spur consumer excitement, but increased prices along with higher for longer interest rates doesn't bode well for the sector.</p><p class=\"\">\"The overall macroeconomic concerns seem to be overshadowing some of the progress and excitement around AI PCs. However, we maintain the view that the impact that on-device AI will have on the industry will be positive, even if the inflection point is delayed,\" Ryan Reith, group vice president with IDC, wrote in a research report last month.</p><p class=\"\">Meanwhile, iPhone maker Apple is an interesting piece to the tariff puzzle. Most of Apple's manufacturing is done in China. Importantly, though, the Cupertino-based tech giant was exempt from tariffs the last time Trump was in office.</p><p class=\"\">When asked about the potential impacts on tariffs during Apple's first-quarter earnings call on Jan. 30, CEO Tim Cook said the company is monitoring the situation, but had nothing more to add. That's led investors and consumers alike to wonder whether the price of iPhones, MacBooks, and more would increase.</p><p class=\"\">If Trump's new trade policies stick, one possible outcome would be for companies like Apple to move some of their manufacturing to countries that aren't affected by the tariffs. Barron's has previously reported that about 80% of smartphones are imported from China, and if the manufacturing moved to other places, the average cost of smartphones could rise by more than $200.</p><p class=\"\">\"As the new tariff is imposed on imports from China, Apple could have its manufacturing partners ramp up production in India and ship to the U.S. This could also be done for other Apple products that are manufactured in countries including Vietnam, Malaysia, etc.,\" BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote on Monday. \"We have assumed 80% of Apple products sold in the U.S. can be sourced from other countries, apart from China.\"</p><p class=\"\">It's also possible that Apple chooses not to increase prices for consumers to keep a competitive edge.</p><p class=\"\">\"It might be that they take the decision that 'we're actually going to swallow some of this for our consumers,' especially if competitors don't increase the price, at least in the short term,\" Martin Balaam, chief executive of product information management platform Pimberly, told Barron's.</p><p class=\"\">In the long-term, though, a potential trade war means consumers may be dishing out more dollars for new gadgets than they once anticipated.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Josh Nathan-Kazis and Mackenzie Tatananni</p><p class=\"\">The clearing of the way for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s confirmation as health secretary Tuesday put pressure on Pfizer shares, despite a positive earnings report form the company early in the morning.</p><p class=\"\">Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, however, was unbothered when he spoke to Barron's at midday.</p><p class=\"\">\"My stance is that you need to engage with him,\" Bourla said of Kennedy, who has been the country's most prominent and persistent critic of vaccine safety. Some of Pfizer's top-selling products are vaccines, including the Covid-19 vaccine Comirnaty and the pneumococcal vaccines sold under the Prevnar brand.</p><p class=\"\">Bourla said that he had met with Kennedy, and they talked about cancer and chronic cardiovascular diseases. \"I told him many times that there are a lot of things that we can do together,\" said Bourla, who has mantained a notably optimistic outlook about the Trump administration in recent public statements.</p><p class=\"\">\"The Trump administraiton, they have a boldness,\" Bourla said. \"When they go for something, they really go. And they are very much into, let's try to cure cancer.\"</p><p class=\"\">Bourla said Tuesday that the proposed Trump tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada — most of which were postponed on Monday — would have no major impact on Pfizer.</p><p class=\"\">\"They have a very strong belief, from the president to his chief of staff, to his cabinet to his White House people, that strong business, strong private sector, strong entrepreneurship means strong America,\" Bourla said. \"It was the case of few people in [the Biden administration] — and unfortunately, those few people, they were not the ones that they had the ideological dominance.\"</p><p class=\"\">Investors did not appear to share Bourla's optimism on Tuesday. Pfizer shares dropped after Kennedy cleared a Senate committee just after 10 a.m., and were down 1.7% in afternoon trading.</p><p class=\"\">Things had looked better before the market opened on Tuesday, when the company reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that came in ahead of Wall Street expectations, and maintained guidance for 2025 it had laid out in December.</p><p class=\"\">The earnings report brought no major surprises. Fourth-quarter earnings were 63 cents a share, beating calls for 47 cents. Revenue of $17.8 billion surpassed the FactSet consensus estimate of $17.4 billion and marked 21% operational growth from the previous year.</p><p class=\"\">The company didn't provide an update on its closely watched obesity pill danuglipron, though promised data by the end of the first quarter.</p><p class=\"\">Pfizer shares fell nearly 50% from the start of 2023 through the end of 2024, while the S&amp;P 500 climbed just more than 50%. A Pfizer shareholder has halved her money over that period, while missing out on a shot at historic gains.</p><p class=\"\">Most of Pfizer's losses came in 2023, but the stock failed to recover in 2024. \"What differentiates the winners from the losers is not that the winners never fail,\" Bourla told Barron's. \"It's that the winners always rise. So we had a bad year. We made a plan. And executed.\"</p><p class=\"\">He said that 2024 was focused on revamping its marketing operations while cutting costs, and that the focus in 2025 will be on the pipeline. \"We are going to put all the focus now of the senior management time on that, and I'm very optimistic that we will achieve very good results.\"</p><p class=\"\">The company said it was \"on track to deliver\" overall net cost savings of $4.5 billion by the end of this year.</p><p class=\"\">One issue dogging the stock in recent years has been the variability in sales of Pfizer's Covid-19 products, the vaccine Comirnaty, and the antiviral Paxlovid. The company's major errors in projecting sales of the Covid products in 2023 was a significant contributor to the stock slide that year. Pfizer now expects sales of the Covid-19 products to stabilize, Bourla said in comments prepared for a Tuesday investor call.</p><p class=\"\">In December, the company rolled out initial guidance for 2025 that investors took as bullish, sending shares up slightly. The company expects revenue of between $61 billion and $64 billion, and adjusted per-share earnings of between $2.80 and $3. Pfizer stood by that guidance on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"\">Sales of Pfizer's respiratory syncytial virus vaccine Abrysvo were $198 million in the fourth quarter, down from $515 million last year, and well below the $482.8 million consensus estimate. After a strong launch in 2023, the RSV market struggled in 2024. Bourla, however, said in comments prepared for the investor call that Pfizer had a \"market leadership position for the season in shipped doses,\" even as U.S. vaccinations dropped.</p><p class=\"\">Products with fourth-quarter sales that beat expectations included the blood-thinner Eliquis, the migraine drug Nurtec, and the cancer treatment Ibrance.</p><p class=\"\">Bourla seems to have brushed off what had seemed a formidable challenge from Starboard Value, which reportedly built a $1 billion stake in Pfizer last year. The activist investor slammed the company's performance in a much-discussed presentation that asserted that Pfizer \"management has failed\" to deliver on important commitments.</p><p class=\"\">Bloomberg reported last week, however, that Starboard hadn't nominated any new board members ahead of an April annual meeting, and that the deadline for nominations had passed on Jan. 25.</p><p class=\"\">Bourla told Barron's Tuesday he had met a second time with Starboard. \"We had a very productive meeting,\" he said. \"It's my first and only experience with an activist, but it's nothing like what I've read. I don't know, maybe it's my charm.\"</p><p class=\"\">Bourla said that he had taken some of Starboard's suggestions, and had used the activists \"as a sounding board.\"</p><p class=\"\">Pfizer is facing a major string of patent expirations beginning in 2026 that will scrape between $17 billion and $18 billion off the company's revenue by the end of the decade. The company hopes to close that gap with sales of products it has acquired in a recent spending spree.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Josh Nathan-Kazis at josh.nathan-kazis@barrons.com and Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The terms refer to systems that can make decisions for businesses, helping them with issues such as customer interaction.</p><p class=\"\">\"A lower cost of compute could bring down AI computing costs of sales and drive better margin on AI enabled offerings.
