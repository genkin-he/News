            "title": "Alpha Modus Sues Walgreens for Patent Infringement, Strengthening Its Leadership in AI-Driven Retail Innovation",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">CORNELIUS, N.C., Feb.  04, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Alpha Modus Holdings, Inc.  (“Company”) announced today that its wholly owned subsidiary, Alpha Modus, Corp. (“Alpha Modus”), has filed a patent infringement lawsuit that also alleges willful infringement against Walgreens Co. (“Walgreens”) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. This legal action underscores Alpha Modus’s unwavering commitment to protecting its groundbreaking AI-driven retail technology and further solidifies its leadership in the rapidly evolving retail innovation landscape.</p><p class=\"\">Championing Innovation and Protecting Shareholder Value</p><p class=\"\">Alpha Modus has transformed AI-powered retail engagement with its extensive patent portfolio, including its latest—its ninth AI patent. Alpha Modus’s patented solutions are designed to enhance consumer experiences, improve retail efficiency, and boost revenue for retailers and brands.</p><p class=\"\">“We believe our technology is currently being used by scores of brands, retailers and technology providers. Our research demonstrates that, as a result, damages due Alpha Modus far exceed an estimated $500 million and could easily run into the billions over the life of our patents. This lawsuit is a necessary step to protect our intellectual property and uphold fair competition,” said Alpha Modus CEO William Alessi.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Alleged Patent Infringement Details</strong></p><p class=\"\">Walgreens allegedly willfully infringed on Alpha Modus’s patented AI-driven retail technology, which enhances in-store shopping through data-driven insights, interactive advertising, and consumer engagement tools. Walgreens’s deployment of Cooler Screens digital smart screens in its stores mirrors the innovations protected under Alpha Modus’s patents, necessitating this legal action.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">A Pattern of Defending Innovation</strong></p><p class=\"\">This lawsuit follows recent actions Alpha Modus has taken against major retailers and technology providers, including Kroger, Cooler Screens, Wakefern, Shelf Nine LLC, VSBLTY Groupe Technologies, Brookshire Grocery, and Grocery TV. These cases reflect Alpha Modus’s commitment to protecting its technology and securing rightful recognition of its innovations. The first of these cases is set for trial in November 2025.</p><p class=\"\">Meanwhile, Walgreens finds itself entangled in another legal dispute, with Cooler Screens recently filing a $200 million lawsuit against the pharmacy giant over alleged contract breaches related to digital smart screens deployed by Cooler Screens. Cooler Screens was co-founded by Greg Wasson, former CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance. The Company’s understanding is that Wasson, through Wasson Enterprises, funded the startup of Cooler Screens and helped deploy Cooler Screens technology throughout Walgreens. These ongoing legal challenges between Walgreens and Cooler Screens further reinforce the strategic importance of Alpha Modus’s claims and the value of its intellectual property.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Market Confidence and Unprecedented Momentum</strong></p><p class=\"\">Alpha Modus’s firm stance on intellectual property aligns with its broader strategic vision, as reaffirmed in a recent press release by CEO William Alessi. That announcement on January 30, 2025, which addressed Alessi's perspective on uninformed or ill-informed speculation in the Company’s stock, market volatility and Alpha Modus’s successful SPAC merger, triggered an unprecedented surge in AMOD stock trading volume, leading to AMOD stock trading over 25 times its public float—demonstrating strong investor confidence in the Company’s ability to achieve its long-term growth objectives.</p><p class=\"\">“Alpha Modus remains committed to redefining retail technology,” added Alessi. “We are dedicated to delivering shareholder value, and this lawsuit reaffirms our commitment to innovation, fairness, and growth.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Alpha Modus</strong></p><p class=\"\">Alpha Modus Holdings, Inc.  is a pioneering technology company specializing in AI-driven retail solutions. The Company’s patented technologies optimize consumer engagement, enhance in-store experiences, and drive measurable returns for retailers and brands.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">    Bosses of big technology firms may find reassurance in comparing artificial intelligence to a lump of coal. Claimed cost-efficiency breakthroughs made by China’s DeepSeek have rocked markets betting on a boom in spending on the chips and servers powering silicon smarts. Analysts and executives like Microsoft’s  Satya Nadella reason that this shouldn’t be an issue by appealing to long-dead economist William Stanley Jevons’ observation that more-efficient coal-fired engines drove higher fuel demand. Scrutinizing other, more recent cases shows why that dynamic doesn’t guarantee success for today’s incumbents.</p><p class=\"\">Jevons, in an 1865 book called “The Coal Question,” laid out the seeming paradox. As steam engines improved, they needed less fuel for tasks like hauling trains. Yet coal demand in the United Kingdom kept rising. The reason is simple: railroad operators consumed less of it per train journey, increasing profits and encouraging them to run more locomotives. The trend is durable. Industrial processes keep getting more efficient, but in 2024, 159 years after the book was written, the world burned a record 8.8 billion tonnes of the stuff.</p><p class=\"\">Like energy, intelligence is a necessary input for economic activity. High-margin products from medicine to software, not to mention the day-to-day running of any big corporation, require mental effort for everything from organizational coordination to cutting-edge research. Even a wildly expensive AI that can perform some of this work will find takers where its output is valuable enough. Lower the price, and the range of tasks to which it makes sense to apply it expands.</p><p class=\"\">So when DeepSeek claimed it could train and run cutting-edge language models at a fraction of the cost of Western versions, it’s no wonder some people found comfort in coal. Sure, investors initially panicked, slicing nearly $600 billion off the market value of Nvidia , the dominant maker of chips used for AI, in one day. But Nadella, in a social media post, declared that “Jevons paradox strikes again,” adding that rising efficiency will cause AI use to “skyrocket.”</p><p class=\"\">Yet Jevons can’t help if demand isn’t there or assumptions underlying investments are wrong. Three more up-to-date industrial examples exemplify the pitfalls.</p><p class=\"\">Take hydraulic fracturing, which involves injecting shale formations with water, sand and chemicals to break open previously inaccessible deposits of natural gas and oil. Technological progress steadily reduced costs, leading to a massive rise in production. The U.S. is now the world’s largest producer of crude oil, with about two-thirds coming from fracking. Yet demand did not rise nearly as much. Companies that took on leverage to finance breakneck expansion couldn’t keep up, and waves of bankruptcies followed. Some 42 fracking companies bearing almost $26 billion in debt went under in 2019, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Gas prices scraped along at all-time lows last year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported.</p><p class=\"\">This might be unfair to AI. Unlike oil – the need for which is increasingly being displaced by technologies like electric cars – intelligence seems unlikely to go out of style. But that still might not prop up, say, a mooted valuation of $300 billion for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI if competition swamps the market. Just look at solar panels.</p><p class=\"\">The cost of a U.S. solar system has fallen about 40% in a decade, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association trade group, with declines even steeper overseas. Unlike with gas, demand has exploded in response. Installed global solar power capacity increased 10-fold between 2013 and 2023.</p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:938.3259911894272px;aspect-ratio:1.5638766519823788\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3OU1GJ-3b4f4ab69c7a44f90455995def2412c7-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"A chart showing the annual increase in global installed solar photovoltaic power capacity\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3OU1GJ-3b4f4ab69c7a44f90455995def2412c7-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f8e4da\"/></picture></div><figcaption class=\"caption-S5VA5POt\"><span class=\"copyright-S5VA5POt\">Thomson Reuters</span><span class=\"description-S5VA5POt\">The world's demand for solar appears limitless</span></figcaption></figure></span></p><p class=\"\">Yet competition is fierce because panels are largely interchangeable. All that matters is price. Operating margins for the top ten manufacturers averaged roughly 0% in the third quarter of 2024, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, despite record shipments.</p><p class=\"\">AI insiders like Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, however, think that competition will thin out. He claims smaller, newer companies have been able to jump into the race because novel techniques that produce big gains are still emerging so rapidly. Over time, improvements will become harder and more costly, by his reckoning. That could mean few firms – or even just one – will dominate.</p><p class=\"\">Yet limited competition and rapid growth do not guarantee extraordinary profit margins, either. Illumina , for instance, has dominated genetic sequencing for over a decade. In 2019, the Federal Trade Commission estimated it had an over-90% share of the market for advanced machines that identify the nucleotides in DNA samples.</p><p class=\"\">These machines have potential uses from telling people where their ancestors came from to designing personalized cancer treatments. Efficiency improvements have been swift and substantial. The price of sequencing one person’s genome, their entire set of DNA, has fallen from roughly $100 million in 2001 to about $200 today, according to the company.</p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:867.6171079429736px;aspect-ratio:1.4460285132382893\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3OU1GJ-ec4ec5097208d4e002b39a10c6bbb183-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"The price of sequencing a human genome has fallen from over $100 million in 2000 to about $200 today.\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3OU1GJ-ec4ec5097208d4e002b39a10c6bbb183-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#fbfafa\"/></picture></div><figcaption class=\"caption-S5VA5POt\"><span class=\"copyright-S5VA5POt\">Thomson Reuters</span><span class=\"description-S5VA5POt\">The price of genetic sequencing has cratered</span></figcaption></figure></span></p><p class=\"\">Yet even with nearly the entire market in its grasp, analysts expect Illumina’s revenue in 2026 to reach only $4.7 billion, according to LSEG data, not much different than in 2021. This is the result of a nasty combination that comes from having to outpace both a demand shortfall and rising competition. Genetic testing still needs to improve to be useful enough to draw in more customers; upstarts, meanwhile, are developing their own tests in an attempt to break through. Illumina must run faster just to stay in place.</p><p class=\"\">Perhaps AI will escape all these traps, proving useful enough, cheap enough, but hard enough to copy that it results in not just an explosion of usage, but profit, too. It’s just a much trickier matter than simply offering up Jevons’ paradox as some kind of proof that less is always more.</p><p class=\"\">Follow @rob_cyran on X</p></span></div>",

Using the company's proprietary hydrogel technology, PRnT™ uses highly localized radiation to destroy cancerous tumors by placing a radioactive isotope directly inside the treatment area. The injection delivers therapeutic radiation from within the tumor without the entrance skin dose and associated side effects of treatment that characterize external-beam radiation therapy. This feature allows the safe delivery of higher doses needed for treating non-resectable and radiation-resistant cancers.</p><p class=\"\">RadioGel® is a hydrogel liquid containing tiny yttrium-90 phosphate microparticles that may be administered directly into a tumor. The hydrogel is a yttrium-90 carrier at room temperature that gels within the tumor interstitial spaces after injection to keep the radiation sources safely in place. The short-range beta radiation from yttrium-90 localizes the dose within the treatment area so that normal organs and tissues are not adversely affected.</p><p class=\"\">RadioGel® also has a short half-life – delivering more than 90% of its therapeutic radiation within 10 days. This compares favorably to other available treatment options requiring up to six weeks or more to deliver a full course of radiation therapy. Therapy can be safely administered as an outpatient procedure, and the patient may return home without subsequent concern for radiation dose to family members.</p><p class=\"\">University veterinary hospitals use the IsoPet® Solutions division to demonstrate animal cancers' safety and therapeutic effectiveness. Testing on feline sarcoma at Washington State University was completed in 2018, and testing on canine soft tissue sarcomas at the University of Missouri was completed in 2019. The Company has obtained confirmation from the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine that IsoPet® is classified as a medical device according to its intended use and means by which it achieves its intended purpose. The FDA also reviewed the product labeling, which included canine and feline sarcomas as the initial indications for use. The FDA does not require pre-market approval for veterinary devices, so no additional approval was required to generate revenue through the sale of IsoPet® to University animal hospitals and private veterinary clinics.</p><p class=\"\">IsoPet® for treating animals uses the same technology as RadioGel® for treating humans.

To streamline market entry, optimize capital efficiency, scale core patented and licensable technology, and meet evolving customer demands, the Company intends to prioritize the production of battery grade lithium carbonate, more than doubling the initial production targets. Mixed Hydroxide Precipitate (MHP), a widely traded, high-value nickel and cobalt product, along with copper and manganese, will make up the rest of its product suite at its Sierra ARC recycling campus.</p><p class=\"\">This near-term focus should enable faster and larger revenue generation, additional technology validation at scale, and expanded industry partnership potential while maintaining a clear roadmap for scaling toward high-purity metal refining that will eventually complement the lithium carbonate production.</p><p class=\"\">Aqua Metals’ Strategy for Scaling a Low-Cost, Decarbonized Critical Minerals Supply Chain, while Creating Highly Desirable Jobs</p><p class=\"\">Aqua Metals has already proven its ability to recover battery grade lithium as well as high purity nickel and cobalt from spent batteries and manufacturing scrap at its pilot facility. By prioritizing lithium carbonate and MHP production, the Company believes it can accelerate commercialization, reduce remaining capital requirements to complete the Sierra ARC, and position itself as a key supplier of domestic, low-carbon, battery-grade materials. The scalable nature of AquaRefining™ is the basis upon which Aqua Metals believes that full metal refining remains within reach as part of future scaling. The Company will continue qualifying battery-grade materials with its pilot program and through ongoing engagements with OEMs, cell, and CAM manufacturers.</p><p class=\"\">“We are taking a smart, market-driven approach that we believe will allow us to scale faster, generate revenue sooner, and strengthen our position in the domestic critical minerals supply chain,” said Steve Cotton, CEO of Aqua Metals. “Our proven technology can already refine MHP into pure metals, but prioritizing a higher-throughput facility should allow us to increase the production of our highest margin material, battery grade lithium carbonate. This plan is designed to accelerate commercialization while maintaining full compatibility with our long-term vision for battery-grade materials that close the loop domestically.”</p><p class=\"\">Optimized Strategy for Near-Term Growth &amp; Long-Term Market Leadership</p><p class=\"\">Aqua Metals' updated strategy reflects the Company's ability to adapt to market conditions while staying focused on long-term goals:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Faster Path to Market, Lower CAPEX</strong> – Prioritizing lithium carbonate along with MHP as the product suite should reduce capital and operational intensity, enable a larger-scale facility that generates more revenue at a higher margin than our previous design – and achieve an attractive ~3 year payback even at today’s lower metals prices.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Strengthened Industry Partnerships</strong> – Aqua Metals is in active discussions with feedstock suppliers and offtake partners, aligning with this accelerated commercialization and product suite plan.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Future-Ready, Modular Expansion</strong> – The Company’s scalable technology should provide an easy transition to refining battery-grade nickel and cobalt sulfates and lithium hydroxide as market conditions and partner demand evolve.</li></ul><p class=\"\">Aqua Metals is continuing its engagement with several prospective financial backers, feedstock supply, and off-take partners, and expects to be able to provide updates later in Q1.</p><p class=\"\">To listen to a Q&amp;A on this topic visit our blog here: https://aquametals.com/blog/</p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:800.1863932898415px;aspect-ratio:1.3336439888164024\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025-02-04:newsml_GNXlmBTd-adf2b56a7eca54a94aa5d53cab401cbc-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025-02-04:newsml_GNXlmBTd-adf2b56a7eca54a94aa5d53cab401cbc-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#90948f\"/></picture></div><figcaption class=\"caption-S5VA5POt\"><span class=\"description-S5VA5POt\">Aqua Metals team standing with battery grade lithium produced at the Pilot facility in Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center</span></figcaption></figure></span></p><p class=\"\"></p><p class=\"\">Rendering of Sierra ARC campus with layout to support Lithium Carbonate and MHP production along with future AquaRefining™ to metals</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Aqua Metals</strong></p><p class=\"\">Aqua Metals, Inc.  is reinventing metals recycling with its patented AquaRefining™ technology.

(“Rezolute” or the “Company”), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing transformative therapies for rare diseases with serious unmet needs, today announced outcomes from an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) review of the open label arm (OLA) portion of the sunRIZE Phase 3 study of ersodetug for the treatment of hypoglycemia due to congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) and provided additional study updates including guidance on its upcoming interim analysis (IA) by the DMC. This IA will assess the adequacy of the sample size for the primary endpoint and may recommend adjustments if necessary.</p><p class=\"\">The open label arm of 8 infant participants ages 3 months to 1 year has been fully enrolled and accrued sufficient data for the DMC to review the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ersodetug, which was administered at doses of 5 or 10 mg/kg over a bi-weekly loading phase followed by a monthly maintenance phase. The task of the DMC was to independently review the safety and PK data in infants for purposes of dose confirmation, continued benefit-risk determinations, and the appropriateness of opening enrollment of the double-blind portion of the study to infant participants at the dose regimen under study. The DMC did not review glycemic efficacy and the Company remains blinded to glucose results and efficacy outcomes.</p><p class=\"\">Findings from the DMC include the following:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Ersodetug was generally safe and well-tolerated in participants 3 months to 1 year of age.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Observed ersodetug drug levels at peak and trough were comparable to exposures in older pediatric participants in the Phase 2b RIZE study, which were demonstrated to be effective.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Safety and exposures validate the chosen dose regimen of 5 and 10 mg/kg administered bi-weekly and monthly.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Subsequent infant participants may now be enrolled into the double-blind, placebo-controlled study.</li></ul><p class=\"\">“We are encouraged by these preliminary outcomes from the open label arm of the sunRIZE study, particularly as it is a strong indication of the safety profile of ersodetug and provides additional validation of the selected doses in very young participants,” said Brian Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Rezolute. “Having recently received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA, 2025 has already been an exciting year for Rezolute and we look forward to additional milestones over the course of this year as we progress in our mission to provide a safe and effective therapy for people living with hyperinsulinism.”</p><p class=\"\">Study start up activities in the U.S. have progressed and sites are expected to be activated and enrolling this quarter. Study enrollment completion is anticipated in the second quarter of 2025 and topline results are expected in the fourth quarter of 2025, pending recommendations from the DMC based on an upcoming IA.</p><p class=\"\">An IA of the study primary hypoglycemia endpoint is being conducted following the accumulation of sufficient patient data and is designed to optimize the study sample size and statistical confidence in the final analysis outcomes. The IA will be conducted at the end of this quarter and the Company plans to announce the conclusions of the DMC early in the second quarter of 2025 while also providing additional overall study updates. There are three possible outcomes from the analysis: (i) futility and the study should be stopped, (ii) continue the study as is or (iii) continue the study as is but increase the sample size by 33% (18 additional patients) to enhance statistical confidence in the final outcome.</p><p class=\"\">If the study sample size is increased, the Company estimates completion of enrollment would shift to the fourth quarter of 2025 and that top line results would be available in mid-2026. Other than for futility, the outcomes of the IA should not be viewed as a read-through to end of study efficacy, either favorably or unfavorably.</p><p class=\"\">For more information on our pipeline and the sunRIZE study, please visit www.rezolutebio.com/for-patients/.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Congenital Hyperinsulinism</strong></p><p class=\"\">Congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) is the most common cause of recurrent and persistent hypoglycemia in children. Patients with congenital HI typically present with signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia within the first month of life. These episodes can result in significant brain injury and death if not recognized and managed appropriately. Additionally, recurrent, or cumulative, hypoglycemia can lead to progressive and irreversible damage over time, including serious and devastating brain injury, seizures, neuro-developmental problems, feeding difficulties, and significant impact on patient and family quality of life. In cases of congenital HI that are unresponsive to medical management, surgical removal of the pancreas may be required. More than half of children with congenital HI require long-term medical treatment for hypoglycemia that is not addressed by available therapies.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Ersodetug</strong></p><p class=\"\">Ersodetug is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds allosterically to the insulin receptor to counteract the effects of insulin receptor over-activation by insulin and related substances (such as IGF-2), thereby shifting over-signaling back into a more normalized range and improving hypoglycemia in the setting of hyperinsulinism (HI). Because ersodetug acts downstream from the pancreas, it has the potential to be universally effective at treating hypoglycemia due to any congenital or acquired form of HI.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About sunRIZE</strong></p><p class=\"\">The Phase 3 sunRIZE study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ersodetug in patients with congenital HI who are experiencing poorly controlled hypoglycemia. Participants between the ages of 3 months to 45 years old are eligible to participate. The study is enrolling up to 56 participants in more than a dozen countries around the world.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Rezolute, Inc.</strong></p><p class=\"\">Rezolute is a late-stage rare disease company focused on significantly improving outcomes for individuals with hypoglycemia caused by hyperinsulinism (HI). The Company’s antibody therapy, ersodetug, is designed to treat all forms of HI and has shown substantial benefit in clinical trials and real-world use for the treatment of congenital HI and tumor HI.

All three Japanese automakers make some of their most popular U.S. models in either Canada or Mexico. As such, the impact of the tariffs would be significant for all three, analysts and industry experts say.</p><p class=\"\">But Toyota and Honda are better prepared to ride out the tariffs - both in terms of their finances and their ability to hike prices, and pass on some of the tariff costs to consumers.</p><p class=\"\">\"The problem is Nissan, which is basically barely making money in the automotive business,\" said James Hong, head of mobility research at Macquarie. Many of the models it builds in Mexico for export to the U.S. are more compact cars like the Sentra and Kicks, which are targeted at cost-conscious consumers who can't easily absorb higher prices.</p><p class=\"\">\"The longer the tariff stays, I think it can be quite a big threat for Nissan. And eventually, if the merger actually goes through, then it can be a burden to Honda as well.\"</p><p class=\"\">Nissan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company said on Jan. 22 it could not speculate on potential policy changes and their impact, but that it remained focused on delivering quality vehicles and would adapt as needed. </p><p class=\"\">Hong estimates that Nissan would face a complete wipe-out in operating profit unless it took action in response to the tariffs - such as re-routing Mexican-made cars to other markets such as Brazil, raising prices or lowering production.</p><p class=\"\">Nissan sources about 27% of its U.S. sales from Mexico, compared to almost 13% at Honda and 8% at Toyota, according to S&amp;P Global Mobility.</p><p class=\"\">Germany's Volkswagen , which like Nissan has a long history in Mexico, has some of the biggest exposure, with 43% of its U.S. sales sourced from Mexico, S&amp;P Global Mobility estimates.</p><p class=\"\">FRESH BURDEN</p><p class=\"\">For Japan's automakers, Trump's move would turn what has long been a stronghold for the industry - a low-cost production base near the U.S. - into a fresh burden.</p><p class=\"\">Nissan has been producing cars in Mexico since 1966, when it opened its first manufacturing plant outside Japan. Toyota, Honda and Mazda  eventually followed. Nissan didn't open a plant in the U.S. until 1983 with its facility in Smyrna, Tennessee.</p><p class=\"\">\"In the case of reasonably priced cars, if the full tariff gets added to the price, consumers are not going to want to buy. So for example 10% gets added to the price of the car and the rest is shouldered by the company,\" said an executive at one Japanese automaker that was not Nissan.</p><p class=\"\">Since production could not be easily stopped in Mexico, another option would be to sell the cars made there to markets in Latin America or elsewhere, the executive added, declining to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.</p><p class=\"\">The problem for Japanese automakers has not been lost on South Korean rival Hyundai , which does not have any plants in Mexico or Canada.</p><p class=\"\">Even if Trump introduced tariffs on all markets outside the U.S., the South Korean automaker doesn't expect to be hit as hard as Japanese rivals, Hyundai's CFO said during a recent conference call.</p><p class=\"\">The threat of tariffs also casts a shadow over Nissan's planned tie up with Honda.</p><p class=\"\">\"This complicates an already difficult-to-execute merger,\" said Christopher Richter, senior Japan autos analyst at brokerage CLSA.</p><p class=\"\">Nissan and Honda are due to announce more details about their proposed deal by the middle of this month. </p><p class=\"\">The two are aiming to tie up by 2026, in what would mark a historic pivot for Japan's auto industry and underline the threat Chinese EV makers now pose to legacy carmakers.</p><p class=\"\">The tie-up also comes as Nissan has been battered by slumping sales in the U.S. and China. In November, it announced a plan to cut 9,000 jobs and 20% of its global production capacity.</p><p class=\"\">Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe has said that Nissan's turnaround was a prerequisite for the merger - and that Honda was not rescuing Nissan.</p><p class=\"\">Nissan's junior partner, Mitsubishi Motors , is considering not joining the merger, sources have said, marking another complicating factor for the plan.</p><p class=\"\">Given the disruption facing the auto industry globally, the tariffs couldn't come at a more inopportune time for most automakers.</p><p class=\"\">\"Mr. Trump doesn't seem to get that you can't change automotive production overnight,\" said CLSA's Richter.</p><p class=\"\">\"In the meantime, they're going to try and charge the consumer as much as they can to offset that and eat as little of the tariff as possible.\"</p></span></div>",
