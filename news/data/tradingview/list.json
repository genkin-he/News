Initial feedback from these customers has been overwhelmingly positive, and the Company is now accelerating production ramp-up to meet anticipated demand.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">AL4 Ramp-Up to Complement Existing AL3 Production</strong></p><p class=\"\">The AL4 Hardcover represents the next evolution in Worksport’s premium tonneau cover lineup, engineered for durability, security, and functionality. Designed with robust American aluminum and precision manufacturing, the AL4 Hardcover caters to the growing demand for high-quality truck bed covers in North America’s booming pickup truck market.</p><p class=\"\">Worksport is preparing an <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">active production ramp</strong> for the AL4 cover, <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">targeting 1,200 units</strong> in the next 30 days. As the Company continues to refine its manufacturing processes, it <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">expects</strong> to <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">double</strong> that output shortly thereafter, while maintaining its existing AL3 production lines. This will be followed by continued production line expansion as sales grow. This strategic approach is projected to allow Worksport to meet the market interest for the AL4 and <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">strengthen</strong> its vision for 2025 and beyond.</p><p class=\"\">Positive Early Feedback From Key Distribution Partners </p><p class=\"\">Major distributors have already expressed strong interest in the AL4 and shared glowing reviews of its build quality, ease of use, and feature set. This aligns with feedback from initial batches sent to B2B clients, reinforcing the Company’s belief that the AL4 will serve as a <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">flagship product line</strong> in its expanding portfolio.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Product Outlook for 2025 and Beyond</strong></p><p class=\"\">In the weeks ahead, Worksport will continue to expand roll out of the AL4 and anticipates opening access to its e-commerce customers. Worksport’s expansion into flagship clean-tech products—including its SOLIS solar tonneau cover and COR mobile power system—remains on track for release later in 2025. Management expects the AL4’s success to dovetail seamlessly with these upcoming innovations, propelling the Company’s brand recognition and solidifying its position in the automotive accessories and clean-tech spaces.</p><p class=\"\">“We are extremely excited that our initial AL4 covers have left the door, and are being well received by initial B2B customers,” said <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Steven Rossi</strong>, Chief Executive Officer of Worksport Ltd. <!-- -->“With production now projected to actively scale, we believe the AL4 will not only drive significant growth in 2025 and beyond but also establish Worksport as a top-tier provider of premium tonneau covers. We anticipate these developments will position us favorably ahead of our SOLIS and COR product launches later in 2025, making this a milestone year across multiple markets.”</p><p class=\"\">Additionally, <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Worksport’s subsidiary</strong>, Terravis Energy, recently announced a breakthrough in AI-supported heat pump technology, with a full reveal expected in just eight (8) days.

Importantly, lead and gallium concentrations increase significantly toward the south, with several samples surpassing 1% lead and 100 g/t gallium. Gallium grades in the southern section range from 50 to 110 g/t, nearly double the northern averages demonstrating a strong correlation with the lead mineral galena.”</p><p class=\"\">“In the southern part of the drilled area, we also encountered thicker layers of copper-silver-gold (Cu-Ag-Au) tailings, with significant 9m and 16m sections containing over 0.10% copper. Grades reached up to 0.47% Cu, 0.56 g/t gold, and 58 g/t silver.”</p><p class=\"\">The consistent and increasing presence of gallium, a critical metal essential for advanced electronics and renewable energy technologies, adds significant potential to the project’s economics. Gallium’s importance has surged in response to China’s recent export restrictions to the U.S. and other nations, driving up prices and emphasizing its strategic value in global supply chains. This geopolitical shift underscores the urgent need for secure and diversified sources of gallium, making our discoveries particularly well-timed.</p><p class=\"\">The results demonstrate that the metal content is continuous at depth and laterally across 1,000 meters of the drilled area (Figure 1). The assay results for each of the eight drill holes are presented in Tables 1 to 8.</p><p class=\"\">The Iron results also indicate a consistent presence of pyrite throughout the deposit. Pyrite (indicatively 50% of the tailings) may represent a valuable by-product for the project. The upcoming metallurgical test work program will also evaluate the potential for pyrite recovery, including estimated grade, by-products and impurities.</p><p class=\"\">Figure 1: 40-hole Quiulacocha Drill Program showing drillholes related to this press release</p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:847.684252919855px;aspect-ratio:1.4128070881997583\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025-02-04:newsml_GNX8y0N8G-4cd562b7e7c4789f06bced6e367cb764-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"Figure 1: 40-hole Quiulacocha Drill Program showing drillholes related to this press release\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025-02-04:newsml_GNX8y0N8G-4cd562b7e7c4789f06bced6e367cb764-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#7b7161\"/></picture></div><figcaption class=\"caption-S5VA5POt\"><span class=\"description-S5VA5POt\">Table 1.
