            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">There are high hopes that China may strike a deal with President Trump to delay the additional 10% tariff, after Mexico and Canada managed to delay the U.S. tariffs, says IG. However, there is \"still room for surprises and Trump could still come down hard\", market strategist Yeap Jun Rong writes in a note. China is seen as a prominent threat to U.S. national security and economic competition, Yeap notes. The tech rivalry between the two countries has become even more pronounced recently with Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, he adds. \"But if China can pull it off, risk sentiments may find further recovery momentum, at least in the near term,\" Yeap says.(amanda.lee@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Kimberley Kao</p><p class=\"\">Markets across Asia staged a relief rally after U.S. President Trump agreed to postpone the start of tariffs on Mexico and Canada by a month, suggesting that a reversal is possible.</p><p class=\"\">Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was recently 1.1% higher on Tuesday, led by gains in auto and electronic stocks. Hong Kong's benchmark index rose 2.0% and South Korea's Kospi gained 1.5%.</p><p class=\"\">The rebound came after the U.S. struck last-minute deals with Mexico and Canada to delay new tariffs, after separate calls with the leaders of both nations. China, another tariff target, is also preparing to talk trade with Trump.</p><p class=\"\">Trump's aggressive move to place tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in imports rattled investors, economists and some lawmakers.</p><p class=\"\">In a social media post, Trump said that his administration will see in the next 30 days if an \"economic deal\" with Canada can be structured. He made similar comments about Mexico earlier Monday.</p><p class=\"\">\"A headlines-driven market seems synonymous with Trump 2.0, much like in 2016,\" Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG, said in a note.</p><p class=\"\">The extended timeline for Mexico and Canada can provide immediate relief for risk sentiment, Yeap said. \"More importantly, it underscores President Trump's willingness to negotiate, potentially with tariff moves as bargaining chips rather than firm policy decisions.\"</p><p class=\"\">Oliver Blackbourn, multiasset portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said that the quick reappraisal on tariffs suggests that there might be a way out. It \"gave markets hope that this could be a short-lived episode, although perhaps this is only the case with Mexico and Canada,\" he said in a commentary.</p><p class=\"\">Other Asian stock markets were broadly higher. Taiwan's Taiex index gained 0.7% and Malaysia's benchmark Kuala Lumpur Composite Index rose 0.5%.</p><p class=\"\">Currency markets, which have whipsawed during the barrage of tariff news, breathed a small sigh of relief over the delays.</p><p class=\"\">The yen weakened against most other G-10 and Asian currencies as sentiment toward risk assets rebounded. The Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso clawed back ground lost after the initial jolt. Asian currencies broadly rose against the U.S. dollar.</p><p class=\"\">The offshore yuan strengthened in a possible reflection of expectations that China too will get a tariff reprieve, Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho Securities' head of macro research for Asia, excluding Japan, said in a note. But the \"overarching geo-economic dimensions to U.S.-China trade means that resolution will be far more fraught than is the case with Mexico and Canada,\" he cautioned.</p><p class=\"\">Relief isn't resolution, as Trump has warned that tariff plans are intact, Varathan said. U.S.-driven trade antagonism threats remain at large, and \"it promises to be a bumpy ride for markets in the weeks ahead,\" with currency markets set up to be the most sensitive to U.S. tariff threats, he said.</p><p class=\"\">The euro, Korean won, Thai baht, Malaysian ringgit, Australian dollar and offshore yuan remain on the line, Varathan said.</p><p class=\"\">Until recently, many on Wall Street viewed threats of the U.S. imposing the highest tariffs in decades as a negotiating tactic in border disputes over drug trafficking and migration and unlikely to materialize.</p><p class=\"\">\"We still think that permanent tariffs on the U.S.'s allies (Canada, Mexico) will not be a thing,\" said Thierry Wizman, global foreign-exchange and rates strategist at Macquarie. \"Tariffs [are] likely to be reversed before they do serious damage.\"</p><p class=\"\">\"That's because concessions are an 'easier' way to deal with Trump's 'problems'...and Trump likes to make 'deals,'\" Wizman said in a note.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Fabiana Negrin Ochoa, Ronnie Harui and Farah Elias contributed to this article.</li></ul><p class=\"\">Write to Kimberley Kao at kimberley.kao@wsj.com</p></span></div>",

However, there is \"still room for surprises and Trump could still come down hard\", market strategist Yeap Jun Rong writes in a note. China is seen as a prominent threat to U.S. national security and economic competition, Yeap notes. The tech rivalry between the two countries has become even more pronounced recently with Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, he adds. \"But if China can pull it off, risk sentiments may find further recovery momentum, at least in the near term,\" Yeap says.(amanda.lee@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0410 GMT - Indonesia's economy is expected to have grown 4.89% in 4Q 2024, slightly easing from 3Q's 4.95%, according to the median estimate of six economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. Growth was likely supported by a modest uptick in demand, despite slower investment growth amid the transition to a new head of state, DBS economists Taimur Baig and Nathan Chow say in a note. The 4Q outcome would peg 2024 growth at an average of 5%, maintaining a steady pace from 2023, they add. Indonesia's 2023 GDP growth was 5.05%. The data is due Wednesday. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0404 GMT - The Singapore dollar strengthens slightly against its U.S. counterpart in the Asian session as traders await President Trump's decision on tariffs for China. The U.S. tariffs on Mexico and Canada have been delayed for a month, so market participants are anticipating that Trump will do the same for China, Maybank analysts say in an FX Research &amp; Strategy report. \"Markets are now awaiting verdict on the last outstanding tariffs for China that could come into effect within hours,\" the analysts say. However, given recent choppy movements, the USD Index remains at the \"whims of tariff headlines,\" the analysts add. USD/SGD is 0.1% lower at 1.3591. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0349 GMT - The yuan is steady against the dollar in offshore markets, supported by hopes for potential China-U.S. talks on tariffs. President Trump mentioned overnight that the U.S. might speak with China, likely within the next 24 hours, regarding tariffs, notes Mizuho Securities Asia's Ken Cheung in an email. Trump's comments revived hopes for a pause in U.S. tariffs on China, similar to the situation with Canada and Mexico, according to the director of FX Strategy. However, with mainland China still closed for holiday today, the USD/CNY fixing guidance on Wednesday will be closely monitored, Cheung adds. USD/CNH is little changed at 7.3114. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0339 GMT - Australia's core inflation remains high and the economy is fully employed, but global risks should make the Reserve Bank of Australia more dovish, say economists at HSBC Global Research. The escalation of trade tensions creates downside risk for the global economy and the scale and breadth of tariffs on products and countries suggest the impact is likely to be significant, say Paul Bloxham and Jamie Culling in a note. They reckon this is enough to tip the RBA's view to start supporting the economy a little earlier than expected. HSBC now sees the RBA cutting its cash rate by 25 bps this month, with another cut expected in 3Q and a final cut in the current cycle in 1Q 2026. (monica.gupta@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0312 GMT - The rise of Chinese AI is denting investor risk sentiment, particularly in the tech sector, Nomura analyst Naka Matsuzawa says in a research note. This has triggered a flight to quality, driving flows into government bonds, though investor jitters have yet to cause a financial shock or credit contraction, the analyst notes. Meanwhile, U.S. tech earnings have been well-received by the market, helping to ease concerns. Even though this AI-driven shock could erode U.S. economic and market strength over time, the impact of Trump's tariffs is likely offsetting what would have otherwise been a weaker USD, the analyst adds. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0250 GMT - Thailand's consumer-price index in January likely rose 1.3% on year, according to the median estimate of seven economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. That would compare with December's 1.23% increase. Inflation may have been driven by several factors, including a low base effect and rising energy prices, says DBS's economics team. Consumer inflation is expected to align with the Bank of Thailand's projections for headline inflation to stabilize around the lower bound of its 1%-3% target range, DBS adds. The data are due Wednesday. (amanda.lee@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0241 GMT - The likelihood of U.S. tariffs on Mexico and Canada is higher despite the delay in the implementation, Nomura analysts say in a research note. Canada and Mexico could \"reach a deal with the U.S. to either avert tariffs or soften the blow by securing conditional exemptions,\" they say. However, the analysts note that Trump previously said there was nothing that targeted countries could do to avoid higher tariffs. \"If these tariffs fully take effect, their size will dwarf the entirety of the tariffs Trump imposed during his first term in office,\" they write, adding, \"higher tariffs are likely to push up core inflation meaningfully, which reinforces our Fed call of no rate cuts this year.\" (sherry.qin@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0234 GMT - Indonesia's inflation may rise post-February as electricity discounts phase out and consumption recovers, CGS International economists Wisnu Trihatmojo and Nazmi Idrus say in a note. However, they anticipate that volatile inflation could stay under control due to a stronger harvest this year, supported by improved weather conditions and increased fertilizer availability. Given the revised VAT hike to only include luxury goods and a softer consumption environment, they lower the year-end inflation forecast to 2.7% from 3.2%. The overall inflation outlook may remain conducive to Bank Indonesia's monetary easing, with expectations for a 5% BI rate by end-2025, down from the current 5.75%, they add. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0227 GMT - Consumer prices in the Philippines likely rose 2.7% on year in January, according to the median forecast of seven economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. That would compare with a 2.9% increase in December. Headline inflation likely cooled due to falling retail prices for rice and easing electricity prices, HSBC's global economics team says in a report. Looking ahead, HSBC expects government efforts to manage rice supply to bring overall inflation down in the next few months. In December, the BSP cut its rates for the third time in 2024 amid low inflation and slowing economic growth. The CPI data are due Wednesday. (amanda.lee@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0215 GMT - The U.S. dollar is likely to maintain its safe-haven status in 1H 2025, DBS Group Research's Philip Wee says in a commentary. Trade uncertainties loom despite the U.S. delaying tariffs on Canada and Mexico, the senior FX strategist says, adding there's potential volatility in markets from President Trump's unpredictability. Meanwhile, Trump has given notice that the European Union was next in line for U.S. tariffs, Wee notes. Also, there was no 30-day reprieve for additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports, with markets awaiting responses from Chinese President Xi, Wee says. The USD Index is 0.3% lower at 108.64. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0155 GMT - The drop in Indonesia's inflation below the central bank's target to the lowest since 2000 is likely to be short-lived, Maybank analysts say. A temporary discount in electricity tariffs was the main factor behind the outsized fall and volatile food inflation may strengthen in the coming months amid rising demand during the Ramadan season, Brian Lee Shun Rong and Chua Hak Bin say. They stick to their call for 2025 headline inflation at 2.6% and 50 bps of rate cuts but note significant uncertainty over whether Bank Indonesia will be able to cut in February, given the need to support the rupiah. The rupiah has weakened 0.8% since BI's January meeting, and U.S. tariff news is buoying the dollar and affecting emerging market currencies, they add.

Still, the index didn't recapture all of Monday's fall in a sign that investors remain skittish. Trump has also signaled unhappiness with the U.S.'s trade relationship with the EU. Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare, Monday's biggest loser, advanced 2.3% as analysts said any effort to expand manufacturing in New Zealand to shield itself from tariffs on products made in Mexico would take time. Skellerup rose 0.2% as Forsyth Barr said the additional 10% tariff on China wouldn't put a big dent in its earnings.
