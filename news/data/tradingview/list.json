In a lecture at Pennsylvania's Lafayette College, Jefferson notes strength in household spending, retail sales and activity in the services sector. \"The consumer spending data we have received recently have surprised me to the upside,\" Jefferson said, per his published remarks. On the other hand, some sectors have been notably weak. Residential investment has been flattish over the past three quarters, he notes, and production from the domestic manufacturing sector was about flat last year too. \"Much of the equipment investment that did take place came from imports,\" Jefferson says.

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect the ADP private-sector jobs report tomorrow to show an increase to 150,000 from December's 122,000, while December trade deficit is forecast to widen to $96.8 billion from $78.19 billion. Jobless claims on Thursday are expected to accelerate and Friday's payrolls increases are expected to slow. Analysts show increasing concerns over stickier inflation and weaker growth potentially resulting from trade wars. The 10-year yield loses 0.031 percentage point to 4.511% and the two-year falls 0.051 p.p. to 4.213%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)</p><p class=\"\">1443 ET - The news in the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey wasn't stellar, but it probably won't be enough to get the Fed leaning toward an interest-rate cut in March, economists at Barclays writes in a note. Hiring and job-quit rates both fell throughout 2024, but leveled off somewhat in the final few months of the year. For now, there is \"little in today's data to alter the course of Fed policy,\" the Barclays team says. But they add that with a lower ratio of job openings to unemployed workers, it's becoming more likely that any further decline in labor demand would push up the unemployment rate in the months ahead. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)</p><p class=\"\">1439 ET - Worker remittances to Mexico rose 2.3% in 2024 to a record $64.75 billion, while showing signs of a slowdown, according to data released by the Bank of Mexico. Remittances in December fell 4.9% from the year-earlier month to $5.23 billion. The outlook is patchy for 2025, even without considering possible impact of an anti-immigrant policy under the Trump administration, BBVA's Juan José Li Ng says in a note. BBVA's base case is that remittances will grow 3% this year, \"but with a downward bias given signs of less absorption of Mexican labor in the U.S. over the past year,\" he says. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1434 ET - New research by economists at the St. Louis Fed suggest that wages become more flexible during times of elevated inflation. Studying data over the pandemic and postpandemic period, Maximiliano Dvorkin and Cassie Marks find that during the stretch of high inflation and low unemployment during 2022, wage increases became more likely and larger in scale. Then, they cooled again as the labor market started to normalize in 2023. In 2022, for example, they find that workers had a 55% probability of a positive wage increase, up from 43% in the years before the pandemic. Wage increases fell in likelihood to 53% in 2023, they find. Economists closely study the interconnection between inflation and wages in part to better understand how likely inflation is to become self perpetuating. (matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)</p><p class=\"\">1352 ET - Economists polled in January by the Bank of Mexico lowered their economic growth estimate for this year to 1% from 1.1% in December, while inflation expectations were virtually unchanged at 3.83% and 3.74% for core CPI. GDP slowed to 1.5% in 2024 from 3.3% the previous year, according to statistics institute Inegi. While public security remained the top perceived obstacle to growth, the percentage of analysts citing foreign trade policy rose to 13% from 7% in the previous survey. On Monday, Mexico reached agreement with President Trump to hold off imposing 25% tariffs on Mexican goods for a month while Mexico takes action to curb migration and fentanyl trafficking.

That would be a sharp step up from the 2.3% annualized rate recorded in 4Q 2024 and is well above most Wall Street analysts' forecasts. The model hasn't ingested much 1Q data yet, but recent construction-spending data and ISM manufacturing indexes have pushed the forecast in a positive direction. The first official estimates of 1Q GDP from the Commerce Department are expected to land in late April. (matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)</p><p class=\"\">1154 ET - Economist and market strategist David Rosenberg says he believes Canada and Mexico should have called President Trump's bluff on a 25% tariff. \"That may end up having been a mistake,\" says the head of Rosenberg Research. In a note to clients after the tariff reprieve, Rosenberg says he believes trade uncertainty overhanging Canada and Mexico will dissipate. \"The 30-day reprieve is a joke. Trump is not raising tariffs and probably was never going to,\" Rosenberg says. Canada now avoids a deep recession, Rosenberg says. The Canadian dollar has strengthened, with USDCAD at C$1.4318, or down 3.2% from a Sunday night peak. Still, Rosenberg sticks to his call for USDCAD at C$1.62, with Canada's economy set to underperform the U.S. and require more rate relief. (Paul.Vieira@wsj.com, @paulvieira)</p></span></div>",

Let’s break down the key factors behind the fade.</p><p class=\"\">Lofty Valuation</p><p class=\"\">Pinnacle has been one of the best-performing stocks on the S&amp;P/ASX 200, soaring 137% over the past year. This rally has been driven by accretive M&amp;A, net inflows, performance fees, and operating leverage.</p><p class=\"\">However, the share price surge has pushed Pinnacle’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio from 25x a year ago to 55x today.

But at the time, the stock had been trading sideways for two years at a more reasonable valuation. On its reporting day (2-Feb-24), Pinnacle shares opened 2.5% higher and closed the session up 8.6%—a stark contrast to today’s price action.</p><p class=\"\">Recent Raise</p><p class=\"\">On 21 November 2024, Pinnacle raised $400 million at $20.30 per share, a 5.3% discount to its previous close. The raise accounted for 9.7% of existing shares and was used to fund strategic investments in VSS Capital and Pacific Asset Management, as well as seed new strategies for its affiliates.</p><p class=\"\">Heading into this result, those newly issued shares were already up around 24%, creating a potential liquidity event for investors to lock in profits.</p><p class=\"\">Appetite for Equities </p><p class=\"\">One notable comment from Pinnacle’s earnings release pointed to ongoing investor caution toward equities:</p><p class=\"\">\"We have still not seen a significant improvement in appetite for equities amongst institutional clients or the increasingly sophisticated wholesale market, with our flows remaining dominated by fixed income, credit and other private markets assets (tailwinds for these asset classes are in fact strengthening).\"</p><p class=\"\">With Pinnacle’s flows skewed toward non-equity assets, the broader market’s tepid sentiment toward stocks may also be weighing on the share price reaction.</p><p class=\"\">Cautiously Optimistic Analysts</p><p class=\"\">Despite the stock’s pullback, analysts remain cautiously optimistic.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\">Macquarie reiterated an Outperform rating, lifting its price target from $26.70 to $27.37</p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\">UBS maintained a Neutral rating, raising its target from $22.50 to $25.20</p></li></ul><p class=\"\">\"With PNI trading at 34x FY26 consensus estimates, it is delivering on high expectations, and we remain Neutral on valuation grounds,\" UBS analysts said in a note on Wednesday.</p><p class=\"\">The Bottom Line</p><p class=\"\">Pinnacle delivered a strong earnings beat, but with its lofty valuation, recent capital raise, and cautious market sentiment toward equities, investors saw an opportunity to take profits rather than chase the rally.</p></span></div>",

In a lecture at Pennsylvania's Lafayette College, Jefferson notes strength in household spending, retail sales and activity in the services sector. \"The consumer spending data we have received recently have surprised me to the upside,\" Jefferson said, per his published remarks. On the other hand, some sectors have been notably weak. Residential investment has been flattish over the past three quarters, he notes, and production from the domestic manufacturing sector was about flat last year too. \"Much of the equipment investment that did take place came from imports,\" Jefferson says.
