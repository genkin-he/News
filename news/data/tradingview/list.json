            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">China could ramp up foreign direct investment in 2025 to ease the impact of higher U.S. tariffs on its exports and the broader economy, ANZ economists say in a research note. Chinese companies have invested heavily in third countries like Mexico since the initial U.S.-China trade dispute in 2018. According to China's commerce ministry, 326 Chinese enterprises registered to invest in Mexico in 2023, up from 133 in 2020. The economists think the trend is not only tariff driven, but also due to supply chain shifts. \"Low industrial profit under overcapacity concerns and relatively high production costs drives supply-chain shift overseas,\" they say. ANZ expects more overseas investment from Chinese companies to reduce reliance on traditional markets and diversify trade influence, they add. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

However, there is \"still room for surprises and Trump could still come down hard\", market strategist Yeap Jun Rong writes in a note. China is seen as a prominent threat to U.S. national security and economic competition, Yeap notes. The tech rivalry between the two countries has become even more pronounced recently with Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, he adds. \"But if China can pull it off, risk sentiments may find further recovery momentum, at least in the near term,\" Yeap says.(amanda.lee@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0410 GMT - New Zealand's NZX-50 index ended 0.7% higher at 12905.04 after U.S. President Trump agreed to delay tariffs on imports from the country's closest neighbors by a month. Still, the index didn't recapture all of Monday's fall in a sign that investors remain skittish. Trump has also signaled unhappiness with the U.S.'s trade relationship with the EU. Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare, Monday's biggest loser, advanced 2.3% as analysts said any effort to expand manufacturing in New Zealand to shield itself from tariffs on products made in Mexico would take time. Skellerup rose 0.2% as Forsyth Barr said the additional 10% tariff on China wouldn't put a big dent in its earnings.

Park cuts her operating-profit forecast for the South Korean company by 37% for 2025, lowering the valuations of its battery and advanced-material units. Still, she says the stock could gain on a possible earnings improvement for chemicals and a potential cathode restocking at its EV battery affiliate later in the year. Nomura cuts its target price for the stock by 33% to KRW280,000 but keeps a buy rating. Shares are 3.2% lower at KRW215,000.

RHB lifts its 2025-2026 earnings estimates for the Singapore-listed manager of workers and student accommodations by 9% each year. RHB maintains the stock's buy rating and raises the stock's target price to S$1.16 from S$1.06. Shares are 0.5% higher at S$0.995.

The stock looks inexpensive at a 10.1X 2025 price-to-earnings multiple and a 9.9% dividend yield, the analyst says. Also, the Thai company's sales from online channels are still growing, with contribution to its total sales expected to increase to 19.2% in 2027 from 10.4% in 2024. However, the manufacturer and marketer of 'Mc Jeans' is slowing store openings, which prompts the brokerage to cut its earnings estimates by 6% for 2025, 8% for 2026, and 11% for 2027.

The shipbuilder's yards are full through 2027 with an order book of roughly US$24 billion, which is expected to lead to earnings CAGR of around 14% over the next two years, the analyst says. Revenue growth and margin expansion are drivers, as about 65% of the company's order book consists of containership orders that command higher value and margins, the analyst adds.

The 250 million ringgit acquisition comes as a surprise, particularly as many of the company's peers have adopted a cautious stance toward the region due to the impending European Union deforestation regulation policy, it notes. However, considering the plantation giant's strong supply-chain credentials, SD Guthrie views Europe as a key growth driver, MIDF says. SD Guthrie's balance sheet remains healthy and is well-positioned for expansion, it adds. MIDF maintains a buy rating on SD Guthrie and keeps its target price at MYR5.43.

Upgrades at Sunway Pyramid Mall and Sunway Carnival Mall may also support earnings, they add. They raise Sunway REIT's 2025-2026 earnings forecasts by 0.9%-1.8% following the completion of the Sunway Kluang Mall acquisition.

He notes that there has been no progress on the deal since it was first proposed in October 2023. The impact on AMMB's capital is minimal, with its Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at a solid 15.3%, he reckons. While a sale may still be considered, there is no urgency, he adds. Ch'ng expects AMMB to see 11.7% earnings growth in FY 2025, supported by better net interest margins and lower credit costs. Maybank maintains a buy rating on AMMB and keeps the target price at MYR6.30. Shares are 0.2% higher at MYR5.65.
