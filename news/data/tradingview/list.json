BetMGM has based forward-looking statements on management's current expectations, assumptions and projections about future events and trends. Examples of these statements include, but are not limited to, BetMGM's expectations regarding its financial outlook (including forecasted net revenues from operations, EBITDA, and expected investment by Entain and MGM Resorts in 2024), projected market share position, its expected growth in new and existing jurisdictions, product capabilities, and achievement of key milestones. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, conditions or results, and involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Included among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking statements are: the significant competition within the gaming and entertainment industry; BetMGM's ability to execute on its business plan; changes in applicable laws or regulations, particularly with respect to iGaming and online sports betting; BetMGM's ability to manage growth and access the capital needed to support its growth plans; and BetMGM's ability to obtain the required licenses, permits and other approvals necessary to grow in existing and new jurisdictions. In providing forward-looking statements, BetMGM is not undertaking any duty or obligation to update these statements publicly as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. If BetMGM updates one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that it will make additional updates with respect to those other forward-looking statements.</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Financial Information</p><p class=\"\">In this press release we provide certain financial measures, including Net Revenue, EBITDA, and Contribution from operations, which have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP. BetMGM believes these measures, which it uses for its own analysis of operations, are useful to supplement the results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  If BetMGM presented Net Revenue from operations in accordance with GAAP, then BetMGM would present the revenues associated with its Nevada digital and retail sports betting operations differently, until such time as BetMGM is licensed as a Nevada gaming operator. Currently under GAAP, its calculation of Net Revenue would be on a basis net of operating costs, such that the GAAP reported Net Revenue would be lower than the Net Revenue reported herein, with net income remaining the same. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before the impact of interest income or expense (net), income tax provision or benefit, and depreciation and amortization.  We define Contribution as Net Revenue, less cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) and marketing acquisition spend.</p><p class=\"\">About BetMGM</p><p class=\"\">BetMGM is a market leading sports betting and gaming entertainment company, pioneering the online gaming industry.

AUTX-703 is a novel, first-in-class, oral KAT2A/B degrader discovered and developed by Auron using its AURIGIN™ Platform. Last December, at the 2024 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting, the Company presented preclinical data supporting the ability of AUTX-703 to provide a significant survival advantage in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In addition, the Company intends to study AUTX-703 in patients with solid tumors such as neuroendocrine prostate and small-cell lung cancer.</p><p class=\"\">Proceeds from the raise will be used to advance AUTX-703 through a Phase 1 clinical proof-of-concept trial in AML, which will begin enrolling patients in the first quarter of this year. In addition, funds will be used to evaluate the therapeutic potential of targeting KAT2A/B in autoimmune disease and advance drug discovery efforts of novel EMT tumor targets identified using AURIGIN.</p><p class=\"\">“I’m proud of the work the Auron team has done establishing a strong product profile for AUTX-703, using an innovative approach to cell state biology to tackle some of the deadliest cancers,” said Kate Yen, Ph.D., Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Auron. “With the funding from this raise, we’re ready to advance AUTX-703 into clinical trials for hematological malignancies and evaluate the promising potential of KAT2A/B in treating inflammatory conditions, all in pursuit of our mission to deliver transformative medicines to patients.”</p><p class=\"\">“The power of Auron’s approach lies in its ability to leverage novel biological insights, enabling the discovery of validated therapeutic targets, optimized model systems for early de-risking, and biomarkers that guide precise patient selection,” said Serge Messerlian, Operating Partner at DCVC Bio and Auron Board Director. “As the demand for targeted therapies and patient-specific trials continues to grow, Auron is uniquely positioned to address these critical needs. We are very impressed by the progress made across the Company’s founding scientific hypothesis, novel platform, and pipeline, led by AUTX-703, and are excited to collaborate with Kate and the Auron team in this next phase of their growth.”</p><p class=\"\">The Series B financing was led by DCVC Bio with additional support from Apollo Health Ventures, Arkin Bio Ventures, BrightEdge (the investment arm of the American Cancer Society), Casdin Capital, Franklin Berger, Mubadala Capital, Polaris Partners and Qiming Venture Partners USA.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Auron Therapeutics</strong></p><p class=\"\">Auron Therapeutics is a platform-powered, product-driven company targeting cell-state plasticity to improve patient outcomes in oncology and inflammatory disease. Auron pioneered its AURIGIN™ platform, which uses AI and machine learning to compare cell states and identify novel drug targets, optimal development models, and biomarkers to facilitate proper patient selection, ultimately accelerating the development of effective and durable therapies. Using AURIGIN, the Company is building a pipeline of small molecule targeted therapies, led by a first-in-class, oral KAT2A/B degrader, AUTX-703, which is being developed for the treatment of both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.

(\"Aimia\" or the \"Company\") today announced the final results of its substantial issuer bid (the \"Offers\") to purchase for cancellation all of its preferred shares (the \"Preferred Shares\") in consideration for 9.75% senior unsecured notes (the \"2030 Notes\").</p><p class=\"\">Based on the count provided by TMX Trust, the depository for the Offers, a total of 7,889,931 Preferred Shares were validly tendered. The total is comprised of:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Series 1: 4,528,157 shares, representing 89.1% of the issued and   outstanding shares of this series.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Series 3: 660,174 shares, representing 40.0% of the issued and   outstanding shares of this series.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Series 4: 2,701,600 shares, representing 99.8% of the issued and   outstanding shares of this series. </li></ul><p class=\"\">Preferred Shares validly deposited by preferred shareholders as of January 30, 2025 have been taken up and paid for by the Company and Aimia issued $142,603,700 principal amount of 2030 Notes in consideration.</p><p class=\"\">Based on the number of preferred shares validly tendered and 2030 Notes issued in consideration, Aimia will generate approximately $6.4 million in annual cash savings when comparing the annual preferred dividends and Part VI.1 tax to the annual cash coupon interest payments. Under IFRS, Aimia expects to record a $53.7 million gain on the transaction, based on the exchange value of the 2030 Notes and the carrying value of the Preferred Shares exchanged.</p><p class=\"\">Aimia considers this transaction as accretive to holders of common shares as it (i) reduces cash outflows on an annual basis, (ii) increases the net asset value for holders of common shares by approximately $0.53 per share, inclusive of all transaction costs, based on the number of shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2024 of 95,413,317.</p><p class=\"\">The 2030 Notes will bear interest at an annual rate of 9.75% payable semi-annually in arrears on June 30 and December 31 in each year (or following Business Day) commencing on June 30, 2025. The 2030 Notes will mature on January 14, 2030. The 2030 Notes will not be listed on a securities exchange or quotation system and consequentially, there will be no market through which the 2030 Notes may be sold and depositing Preferred Shareholders may not be able to resell the 2030 Notes acquired under the Offers.</p><p class=\"\">Preferred Shares not tendered through the Offers will continue to be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and holders may expect to receive their quarterly distributions as customary.</p><p class=\"\">As specified in its issuer bid circular dated November 21, 2024 (the \"Circular\"), Aimia has the option to acquire the remainder of the Preferred Shares by way of a compulsory acquisition (\"Compulsory Acquisition\") if the Company takes up and pays for 90% or more of the Preferred Shares within 120 days of the date of the Offers. The Compulsory Acquisition option can be exercised by the Company by sending an offeror's notice to preferred shareholders who did not accept the Offers within 60 days after the expiry date (but in any event within 180 days after the date of the Offers).</p><p class=\"\">The Substantial Issuer Bid marks the first initiative introduced as a result of Aimia's strategic review process designed to unlock the Company's value. The Offers provide preferred shareholders with an opportunity to realize all or a portion of their investment in the Company based on (i) the limited liquidity and perpetual nature of the Preferred Shares, (ii) the higher annual yield the 2030 Notes will provide relative to the current dividend (annualized) of each series of Preferred Shares, (iii) the fixed maturity date of the 2030 Notes, and (iv) the accelerated liquidity available to holders of 2030 Notes in certain events. The Strategic Review Committee and the Board of Directors believe that the exchange of Preferred Shares for the 2030 Notes under the Offers for the purchase price (as detailed in the Offer Documents) represents an effective recapitalization of the Company and is in the best interests of the Company and its security holders.</p><p class=\"\">About Aimia</p><p class=\"\">Aimia Inc.  is a diversified company focused on unlocking the growth potential of its two global businesses, Bozzetto, a sustainable specialty chemicals company, and Cortland International, a rope and netting solutions company.

Adjusted earnings adds back non-cash, after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of $0.20 per diluted share.</p><p class=\"\">\"AMETEK delivered strong results in the fourth quarter, with outstanding operating performance driving robust core margin expansion, record earnings and strong cash flow growth,\" stated David A.
