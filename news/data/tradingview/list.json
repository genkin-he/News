            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Jinjoo Lee</p><p class=\"\">After days of trying to process what tariffs on Canadian and Mexican oil might mean for their business, U.S. refiners saw their shares bouncing on news that the tariffs would be delayed.</p><p class=\"\">Refining giants Marathon Petroleum and Valero Energy were up 6.6% and 4.2%, respectively, and were both among the top-10 gainers on the S&amp;P 500 as of early afternoon Tuesday. It also helped that Marathon on Tuesday reported better-than-expected earnings.</p><p class=\"\">The proposed 10% tariffs on Canadian energy and 25% on imports from Mexico would have caused headaches and added costs for U.S. refiners. Canada and Mexico are the two largest sources of crude oil imports for the U.S., supplying about 60% and 7% of crude oil imports, respectively. While the U.S. is a net exporter of crude oil, most of its refineries need heavy crudes-the types supplied by Canada and Mexico-to run efficiently. Most of the crude oil produced domestically is the lighter variety.</p><p class=\"\">Refiners with a heavy footprint in landlocked areas-such as the Midwest and the Rocky Mountain regions-might have borne heavier costs than others. Most Canadian crude ends up in those places where there aren't many alternative heavy crude options. Refiners with the highest exposure to Canadian crude rallied the most Tuesday. HF Sinclair and Par Pacific, for instance, rely on the Northern neighbor for more than a quarter of their crude input, per estimates from energy-focused investment bank Tudor, Pickering Holt (TPH). HF Sinclair shares rose 6.5%, while Par Pacific added 6.1%.</p><p class=\"\">Marathon Petroleum relies on Canada for 17% of its crude diet, according to TPH. But Rick Hessling, Marathon's chief commercial officer, said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that it has worked \"tirelessly for a long time\" on its logistics capability. He noted that many of its refineries in the mid-continent region can pivot to local crudes such as those from the Bakken and the Rockies.</p><p class=\"\">Even so, switching to lighter crude would come with costs of its own: Doug Leggate, equity analyst at Wolfe Research, noted in a report that refiners choosing to shift to lighter crude may have to lower their refinery runs \"given the higher light product yield that its system may not be able to process.\" TPH estimates that a 10% tariff on Canadian oil could cause a $2 to $4 per barrel cost for Canadian producers, $1 to $2 a barrel for U.S. refineries and $1 to $3 a barrel for U.S. consumers.</p><p class=\"\">The ultimate split of those costs won't be known unless the proposed tariffs are actually put in place. What is clear is that there aren't many clear winners in the oil industry from a tariff scenario.</p><p class=\"\">This item is part of a Wall Street Journal live coverage event.

(NYSE-PKE) announced that, with today’s payment of the regular cash dividend of $0.125 per share, the Company has now paid $601.1 Million in cash dividends, or $29.35 per share, since the beginning of the Company’s 2005 fiscal year. Today’s dividend was declared on December 9, 2024 and was payable to shareholders of record at the close of business January 3, 2025.</p><p class=\"\">Park has paid 40 consecutive years of regular quarterly cash dividends, without ever skipping a dividend payment or reducing the amount of the dividend…not after 9/11, not after the Dot Com collapse, not during the pandemic, not ever.</p><p class=\"\">Brian E. Shore, Park’s Chairman and CEO, said, “$600 plus million of cash dividends since the beginning of our 2005 fiscal year is a hell of a lot of money for a small company like Park which was started back in 1954 in a garage in Queens, New York by two young guys from Brooklyn who grew up in the depression. According to legend, Jerry and Tony started Park with 40,000 bucks they had saved up from their war duty pay.”</p><p class=\"\">Park Aerospace Corp. develops and manufactures solution and hot-melt advanced composite materials used to produce composite structures for the global aerospace markets. Park’s advanced composite materials include film adhesives (Aeroadhere®) and lightning strike protection materials (Electroglide®). Park offers an array of composite materials specifically designed for hand lay-up or automated fiber placement (AFP) manufacturing applications. Park’s advanced composite materials are used to produce primary and secondary structures for jet engines, large and regional transport aircraft, military aircraft, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs commonly referred to as “drones”), business jets, general aviation aircraft and rotary wing aircraft. Park also offers specialty ablative materials for rocket motors and nozzles and specially designed materials for radome applications. As a complement to Park’s advanced composite materials offering, Park designs and fabricates composite parts, structures and assemblies and low volume tooling for the aerospace industry. Target markets for Park’s composite parts and structures (which include Park’s proprietary composite SigmaStrut™ and AlphaStrut™ product lines) are, among others, prototype and development aircraft, special mission aircraft, spares for legacy military and civilian aircraft and exotic spacecraft.

In a move that wasn't explicitly tied to Trump's tariffs, China also said it was starting an antitrust probe into Alphabet's Google, the internet search engine.</p><p class=\"\">Beijing added two U.S. companies to its unreliable entity list — Calvin Klein owner PVH, and biotechnology company Illumina.</p><p class=\"\">\"The two entities have violated normal market-trading principles, terminated regular trade with Chinese companies, and adopted discriminatory measures against Chinese companies,\" state-owned news agency Xinhua reported, citing a statement from the Commerce Ministry.</p><p class=\"\">The ministry said the list only targets the very few foreign entities that undermine China's national security. It means measures could be taken against the companies.</p><p class=\"\">PVH told Barron's the company is \"surprised and deeply disappointed\" by the decision.</p><p class=\"\">China also announced export controls on scarce elements that are critical for making electronics, including tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum, and indium. China is a big miner of these materials.</p><p class=\"\">The moves follow a last minute delay to Trump's plans to raise taxes on imports from Mexico and Canada. That sparked a relief rally in stocks, which had fallen sharply on concern that the new tariffs would fan inflation and hamper economic growth. The question now is whether Trump and China can work out a similar deal to prevent the trade war from escalating further.</p><p class=\"\">\"For the most part, these moves are warnings that China intends to harm U.S. interests if need be but still give China the option to back down,\" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics. \"The tariffs could be postponed or cancelled before they come into effect\" on Feb. 10.</p><p class=\"\">Evans-Pritchard also noted that the Chinese retaliation only targets about $20 billion worth of imports, compared to the $450 billion in Chinese wares that Trump has targeted. What's more, China didn't raise tariffs on strategic goods such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.com and Callum Keown at callum.keown@dowjones.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
