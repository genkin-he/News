Total revenues for the quarter decreased by 5.6% year-over-year to $590.1M, primarily due to a 2.3% decline in coal sales volumes. Net income for the quarter was down to $16.3M compared to $115.4M in 4Q23, reflecting higher operating costs and non-cash impairment charges of $31.1M related to the MC Mining operation. Adj. EBITDA came in at $124.0M, a 27.2% decline sequentially. Despite these headwinds, ARLP remains committed to its FY25 guidance, expecting improvements driven by efficiency realizations in its operations, a strengthening order book, and declining domestic inventories.</p><p class=\"\">To view the full announcement, including downloadable images, bios, and more, click here.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Key Takeaways:</strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">ARLP continued to expand its O&amp;G royalties' business, completing $9.6M in mineral interest acquisitions during the quarter.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">ARLP reached its coal inventory goal for FY24, reaching 0.6 million tons.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">The Company ended 4Q24 with a solid liquidity position of $593.9M, consisting of $137.0M in cash and $456.9M in available credit.</li></ul><p class=\"\"><em>Click image above to view full announcement.</em></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Stonegate</strong></p><p class=\"\">Stonegate Capital Partners is a leading capital markets advisory firm providing investor relations, equity research, and institutional investor outreach services for public companies.

And that looks set to continue, with China now jumping into the tariff fray, and equities looking weaker for Tuesday.</p><p class=\"\">That's as we're still in the belly of earnings season, with results from a big Nvidia competitor looming after the close.</p><p class=\"\">Stepping away from the headlines that make the market these days, our call of the day from Bank of America flags a contrarian stock market indicator that they say is just a whisker away from a \"sell signal.\"</p><p class=\"\">BofA's sell side indicator, tracks average recommended equity allocations by Wall Street strategists. In January, that indicator climbed to 57%, the highest since early 2022 and a mere 1 percentage point shy from a sell signal, Savita Subramanian, equity and quant strategist, and her colleague Victoria Roloff, told clients in a note.</p><p class=\"\">In other words, when so many strategists are saying buy stocks, the best plan of action may be to not follow the herd. When the indicator has been at the 57% level or higher, returns for the next 12 months were positive  65% of the time versus 82% overall, BofA said.</p><p class=\"\">So the bank's voicing caution in a crowded market, as they put it.</p><p class=\"\">\"The [sell-side indicator] has been a reliable contrarian indicator. In other words, it has been bullish when Wall Street was extremely bearish and vice versa,\" and now sits at the closest to a sell signal since December 2021, said Subramanian and Roloff.</p><p class=\"\">Last month, those strategists left their equity allocations unchanged after a 2.8% gain for the S&amp;P 500 SPX in December, which suggests a wait-and-see approach on trade tensions and any policy risks, said the BofA team.</p><p class=\"\">\"The current level of 57% implies an estimated price return of 10.5% over the [next twelve months], lower than the past two years but still healthy. We see this as support for our view that 2025 is a year for buying stocks, not the index,\" they said.</p><p class=\"\">Societe Generale has predicted 2025 will be the best stock picking period in 25 years, citing reflationary policies from President Trump's administration, such as lower taxes, less regulation and lower oil prices, which they say can all yield potential stock picking ideas.</p><p class=\"\">Plus: Stock market's wild ride on Monday could be a microcosm of what to expect in 2025</p><p class=\"\">The markets</p><p class=\"\">U.S. stock-index futures (ES00) (NQ00) are turning higher, though Dow industrials futures are lagging.
