It first turned to parametric cover in 2023, when its property deductible was increased from $1mn per event to $10mn.</p><p class=\"\">The department purchased a parametric hurricane policy, brokered by Alliant, which was renewed in 2024 with a $10mn limit.

Other government entities including Puerto Rico and the states of Louisiana and Utah have bought parametric natural catastrophe covers in recent years.</p><p class=\"\">The University of California, Los Angeles World Airports and the County of Los Angeles are among the public sector organisations to have purchased parametric programs brokered by Alliant.</p><p class=\"\">Public sector parametric policies in the US have most often covered hurricane and earthquake risks, while some cities have recently begun piloting index-based flood insurance. Parametric covers for tornado risks are less widely adopted, with private sector buyers including technology firms and solar farms.</p><p class=\"\">Parametric tornado insurance contracts most often settle based on the Enhanced Fujita scale (EF-scale) reported by the US National Weather Service, which estimates tornado wind speeds based on surveys of the damage caused.</p><p class=\"\">Alliant declined to comment beyond the general market update on parametric insurance provided in its end-of-year insurance marketplace insights and observations report.

Kennedy Jr. are now on a glide path to confirmation after intense, last-minute lobbying by the White House. Meanwhile, Trump's gripe that big banks unfairly discriminate against conservatives has a surprising ally: progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren. And in Hollywood, Harrison Ford is working harder than ever.</p><p class=\"\">Today's Headlines</p><p class=\"\">Trump said the U.S. will take control of Gaza, a proposal that would entangle the U.S. in a massive development project and leave the idea of a Palestinian state in tatters.</p><p class=\"\">A White House lobbying push helped nominees Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. squeak through Senate committees, putting them on track for confirmation next week.</p><p class=\"\">The U.S. Postal Service said it would stop accepting parcels from China and Hong Kong, cutting off a service that is popular with online vendors in China.</p><p class=\"\">The swift dismantling of USAID, including putting all staff on leave, appears to be a test case for the Trump administration's efforts to downsize the government.</p><p class=\"\">Nissan's board is planning to reject Honda's merger terms, putting in danger a plan announced less than two months ago.</p><p class=\"\">Live From The Markets</p><p class=\"\">Options traders are positioning for big technology shares to keep climbing.</p><p class=\"\">Google's latest artificial-intelligence splurge doesn't have the best timing. It still looks necessary, writes Dan Gallagher.</p><p class=\"\">Read It Here First</p><p class=\"\">Elizabeth Warren agrees with Trump: big banks discriminate.</p><p class=\"\">Comments Trump made last month suggesting that Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase were unfairly closing the accounts of conservatives set off a political firestorm. Warren said that her office has identified thousands of examples of consumers losing access to their bank accounts — and most of the closures were by the biggest U.S. banks. Now she wants the president to take action to stop the practice, Alexander Saeedy reports.</p><p class=\"\">A Russian TV star is now the voice of the Kremlin.</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, Dmitry Kiselyov's weekly current affairs show, \"News of the Week,\" seems similar to any news bulletin on CNN or the BBC. The message he broadcasts is anything but. Once a fresh-faced admirer of Western news networks, Kiselyov has become a driving force behind Putin's propaganda machine, Matthew Luxmoore reports.</p><p class=\"\">Expert Take</p><p class=\"\">Q: What do Trump's first weeks tell us about his China strategy?</p><p class=\"\">China has factored into over a third of the more than 80 executive orders and key actions Trump has signed so far, illustrating how intertwined the No. 2 economy is with U.S. interests. Not yet articulated is the president's broader strategy for handling America's biggest rivalry — and whether he sees it in ideological terms or as a series of deals, James T. Areddy writes.</p><p class=\"\">A: The big question is whether Trump shares his predecessor's and much of Washington's view of the China rivalry as a historic battle or whether he intends to frame it more narrowly, in a reprise of his first-term focus on trade imbalances.</p><p class=\"\">To China watchers, Trump's tariff scare against Mexico and Canada suggests a playbook similar to how the president went after China during his first term, using trade threats as a negotiating tool. The action against Canada also reinforced doubt that he would work with allies to counter China.</p><p class=\"\">While trade appears to remain Trump's primary focus, the wide range of executive orders might be aimed at softening Beijing up to make deals in other areas, said Henry Huiyao Wang, founder and president of the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing think tank. He points to Trump's order to create an \"iron dome\" designed to shield the U.S. from China's hypersonic missiles, which Wang sees as a bid to compel Beijing into nuclear-arms talks.</p><p class=\"\">Other actions by Trump seem to reject the national-security concerns regarding China that have gripped Washington, such as his executive order to pause the legislatively mandated shutdown of TikTok to pursue a deal to sell the Chinese platform. Similarly, Trump described the emergence of China's high-performing AI tool DeepSeek not as a threat to a strategic, futuristic U.S. industry, but as a fresh spur to American competitiveness.</p><p class=\"\">See The Story</p><p class=\"\">The Ukraine war is changing the future of the world's tallest dam.</p><p class=\"\">The Rogun Dam in Tajikistan, set to be the world's tallest, could reshape Central Asia's energy landscape. And with the Ukraine war shifting geopolitics in the region, Tajikistan is gaining international support.</p><p class=\"\">Happening Today</p><p class=\"\">Trump is planning to issue an executive order effectively banning transgender girls and women from participating in female sports events in schools and colleges.</p><p class=\"\">Earnings: Disney, Qualcomm, Uber, MicroStrategy, Emerson Electric, MetLife, Allstate, Ford</p><p class=\"\">Number Of The Day:</p><p class=\"\">12%</p><p class=\"\">Google parent Alphabet's revenue growth rate in its most recent quarter, the tech giant's lowest since 2023. A slowdown in cloud-computing sales dragged down the company's revenue growth, sending its shares down in after-hours trading and paring much of this year's gains.</p><p class=\"\">And Finally...</p><p class=\"\">Harrison Ford is still full of surprises.</p><p class=\"\">In his sixth decade in show business, Ford is surprised to find himself operating in a new mode. He's in two wildly different, multiseason shows — the \"Yellowstone\" prequel \"1923\" on Paramount+ and Apple TV+'s \"Shrinking\" — both of which he signed on to before any scripts had been written. Ford took a similar leap when he agreed to join the Marvel Cinematic Universe. \"Again, no script,\" he said in an interview with WSJ. Magazine. \"Why not? I saw enough Marvels to see actors that I admired having a good time.\"</p></span></div>",

The result was driven by contribution from Banco BPM as well as by higher revenue from the French bank's asset gathering and corporate and investment banking businesses, JPM analysts say. Corporate and investment banking, asset management, insurance and private banking revenues were stronger than expected, and JPM says it expects low single-digit EPS upgrades after the result. The upgrade is expected to be driven by the performance of Credit Agricole's asset gathering and its corporate and investment banking business, JPM says in a research note.

The analyst remains positive about the German residential property market, with Vonovia expected to benefit from the current trend in higher rents, Klose says.

Google Cloud revenue grew to nearly $11.96 billion in the fourth quarter from $9.19 billion a year earlier, below a FactSet forecast of $12.16 billion. Weaker-than-expected growth in cloud computing suggests the AI frenzy isn't automatically translating into big bucks for infrastructure providers, Coatsworth says.

Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said the group expects to invest roughly $75 billion in capex this year. Investors would have welcomed large capex in the past as a sign that Alphabet was doing everything in its power to cash in on the AI frenzy, Coatsworth says. \"Now the reverse is true,\" he says. \"There are fears it might be digging itself a big hole and potentially wasting money if rivals like DeepSeek have shown it is possible to do things a lot cheaper.\" Alphabet shares are down 7.5% premarket at $190.91.

Metal prices rebounded on-week as the U.S. pushed back Canadian and Mexican tariffs one month, but trade tensions and global growth risks are still pressing, RBC Capital Markets' Sam Crittenden says. The U.S. imposed another Chinese import tariff of 10%, while China retaliated with fresh levies, including critical mineral export restrictions. President Trump and China's President Xi will talk over the coming days and U.S. tariffs won't be implemented until Feb. 10, so they could strike a deal before implementation, Crittenden writes. Tariff uncertainty has prompted a significant disconnect between LME and U.S. commodities exchange Comex copper pricing, with the market factoring in more potential trade disputes, the analyst adds.

Its earnings were boosted by the stabilization of refining margins, which were particularly low in the prior quarter, he adds. The French oil-and-gas company has navigated a challenging 2024 environment well and its attractive long-term growth profile means it is well-positioned for the future, Carulli adds. TotalEnergies shares rise 1% to 57.56 euros.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan</p><p class=\"\">As the week's tariff rollercoaster levels out a bit, Wall Street stocks are tilting lower again - clouded by a poor reception for Alphabet's results, lingering China tariff hike plans and fresh interest rate rise speculation in Japan.</p><p class=\"\">U.S. stock futures  were back in the red ahead of Wednesday's bell as shares in megacap Alphabet  plunged 7% overnight. The drop came amid doubts about the Google parent's cloud computing business, much like Microsoft last week, and anxiety about its huge investment in artificial intelligence - especially in the light of last week's DeepSeek news.</p><p class=\"\">Following the previous day's sideswipe from Beijing on an anti-monopoly probe into Google there, Alphabet said it would spend $75 billion on its AI buildout this year, 29% more than Wall Street expected, and it missed its cloud revenue target.</p><p class=\"\">Adding to the overnight pressure, shares in Advanced Micro Devices  fell 9% after the company's AI chip revenue failed to meet lofty expectations.</p><p class=\"\">With a deluge of earnings updates across the world this week, the news on global macro policy did not help either.</p><p class=\"\">Japan's yen  surged to its best levels of the year so far after domestic wage numbers rekindled talk of another Bank of Japan rate hike this year.</p><p class=\"\">Japan's December inflation-adjusted real wages rose 0.6% year-on-year thanks to a wintertime bonus bump, with government officials expressing optimism that wage hike momentum is growing.</p><p class=\"\">\"We will continue to raise interest rates and adjust the degree of monetary support, if underlying inflation accelerates toward 2% as we project,\" Kazuhiro Masaki, director-general of the BOJ's monetary affairs department, told parliament.</p><p class=\"\">As Chinese markets returned from the week-long lunar new year holiday, there was a lot to unpack - not least this week's 10% U.S. tariff hikes on Chinese imports, planned retaliation from Beijing by Feb. 10 and the DeepSeek AI developments.</p><p class=\"\">But both mainland China and Hong Kong stock indexes fell on Wednesday as prior day's hopes of a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping to avert the tariff war were doused. U.S. plans to slap tariffs on Canada and Mexico were postponed for a month this week after similar calls between Trump and the leaders of those countries.</p><p class=\"\">Trump said late on Tuesday he was in no hurry to speak to Xi. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters a Trump-Xi call still needed to be scheduled.</p><p class=\"\">EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS</p><p class=\"\">Adding to the tension, the U.S. Postal Service said it would temporarily suspend parcels from China and Hong Kong as Trump ended a trade provision this week used by retailers including Temu and Shein to ship low-value packages duty-free to America.</p><p class=\"\">And in the background, private sector business surveys showed China's services activity expanded at a slower pace in January, with the Lunar New Year holidays worsening employment.</p><p class=\"\">The currency reaction was a bit more mixed, however. While the onshore yuan , guided closely by the People's Bank of China, was reset slightly weaker after the holiday break, the offshore yuan  strengthened for the second day.</p><p class=\"\">The combination of yen and yuan gains weighed on the dollar index  more broadly.</p><p class=\"\">And a retreat in U.S. Treasury yields  dragged on the greenback to boot, with the 10-year slipping back below 4.5%.</p><p class=\"\">Treasury yields ebbed on a mix of trade war angst and the latest employment update, which showed U.S. job openings falling more than expected in December. That takes some of the perceived heat out of the labor market and allows more wiggle room for the Federal Reserve to keep easing policy.</p><p class=\"\">     \"I continue to see a gradual reduction in the level of monetary policy restraint placed on the economy as we move toward a more neutral stance,\" Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson said on Tuesday. \"That said, I do not think we need to be in a hurry to change our stance.\"</p><p class=\"\">Two Fed cuts this year are virtually fully priced for the year - resuming around mid-year.</p><p class=\"\">In a big week for employment numbers, private sector payrolls for January will be released by ADP later on Wednesday and the national payrolls report is due on Friday.</p><p class=\"\">Elsewhere, geopolitical tension added to trade war worries - with Trump's statement on the United States taking over Gaza confounding many who assumed he wanted to withdraw the country from foreign conflicts and remove expensive U.S. military and aid funds from around the world.</p><p class=\"\">Much like the puzzlement over similar contradictions in trade and currency policy, the statement left more confusion about the road ahead. </p><p class=\"\">Gold  seemed the only real beneficiary of the uncertainty and set another new record with gains of almost 10% for the year so far.</p><p class=\"\">In other corporate news, the Nikkei newspaper said Japan's Nissan  will call off merger talks with rival Honda  - abandoning a tie-up that would have created the world's third biggest automaker. Nissan shares fell 4% and Honda's rose 8%.</p><p class=\"\">Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday: </p><p class=\"\">* U.S. January private sector payrolls from ADP, Jan service sector surveys from ISM and S&amp;PGlobal, December international trade balance; Canada Dec international trade  </p><p class=\"\">* Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Fed Board Governor Michelle Bowma, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and Richmond Fed chief Thomas Barkin all speak; European Central Bank chief economist Philip Lane speaks in
