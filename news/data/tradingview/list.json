She was a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policymaking body, in 2024, before rotating off the voting list in 2025. The San Francisco Fed will next get a vote in 2027.</p><p class=\"\">The FOMC held its target for the federal-funds rate at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% at its January meeting. It cut rates by a total of a percentage point at its final three meetings of 2024.</p><p class=\"\">Daly sees the positive economic momentum continuing this year, giving the Fed the ability to let still-restrictive interest rates slow inflation and watch what government policies are enacted.</p><p class=\"\">\"I remind everybody, the world is always full of uncertainty,\" Daly said. \"In my time at the Fed, I've lived through a financial crisis and a pandemic, and those were extraordinarily uncertain times...Uncertainty is not a paralysis. It just means we have to watch and be careful and thoughtful as we navigate the information we have. So that's how I'm approaching 2025 as a monetary policy maker: We can take our time.\"</p><p class=\"\">The primary sources of uncertainty in 2025 include decisions by President Donald Trump's administration, as shown by the on-again, off-again tariff episode among the U.S., Mexico, and Canada over the weekend and on Monday.</p><p class=\"\">While tariffs can have non-economic goals that are outside the areas central banks assess, she said she doesn't see a significant risk to U.S. growth. She will be evaluating the effect of enacted and potential tariffs by their impact on inflation.</p><p class=\"\">\"They're really not that big by economic damage, there's some economic damage,\" Daly said. \"But as much as I hate them, I can't gin myself to say they're terrible.\"</p><p class=\"\">Immigration policies are another potential area of economic disruption, should the U.S. labor force be meaningfully affected, Daly said. Other factors are potential tax reductions and deregulation. The ultimate impact on the economy will depend on the scope, magnitude, and timing of those policies</p><p class=\"\">\"The way we have to think about it as policy makers is to [focus on the] net effect of all of those, and we don't know what it is yet,\" Daly said. \"If you take preemptive action...you can end up making a policy mistake.\"</p><p class=\"\">The FOMC's next meeting is on March 18-19, when officials will have two more months of inflation and jobs data to consider. Futures are pricing in a roughly 85% chance of a continued pause in interest rates.</p><p class=\"\">Market pricing and the FOMC's median projection both call for a total of a half of a percentage point of interest-rate cuts this year.</p><p class=\"\">\"The Fed is in a good position to wait and see,\" Daly said. \"We will get inflation down...and if it takes more than the rest of this year, we'll continue our work.\"</p><p class=\"\">Write to Nicholas Jasinski at nicholas.jasinski@barrons.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The move brings the Stamford, Conn., company's corporate headcount down to about 300 employees, Lovesac said, and includes layoffs and redistributing jobs elsewhere in the company.</p><p class=\"\">Lovesac, and many of its U.S. competitors, have shifted their manufacturing operations out of China and into other countries in Southeast Asia such as Indonesia and Vietnam in recent years. Trump's latest tariffs could result in higher prices for home goods and weigh on furniture makers' sales as consumers continue to shy away from big-ticket purchases, further delaying the sector's recovery after the pandemic.</p><p class=\"\">When Trump began raising tariffs on China in 2018, Lovesac made 90% of its products in China. The company has since reduced that rate to between 15% to 19%. Lovesac also makes less than 1% of its products in Mexico, another target of Trump's tariff measures.</p><p class=\"\">\"We're not pursuing any drastic cost-cutting measures, but we're just being very prudent and not adding many new costs as we enter these new frontiers,\" Nelson said.</p><p class=\"\">Lovesac said it aims to reduce its manufacturing in China to 10% to 15% by the end of the year and is considering raising prices to counteract the effects of the tariff.</p><p class=\"\">Nelson said he doesn't expect the imminent 10% tariff hike for China-made goods to have a meaningful effect on the company's earnings, however. He said Lovesac's workforce reduction will allow the company to expand into new categories within the next three years.</p><p class=\"\">Lovesac mostly sells sectional sofas and plans to branch out into couches and chairs, Nelson said.</p><p class=\"\">\"That's a big opportunity for us and we believe that these other categories will be seeing recoveries,\" he said.</p><p class=\"\">Lovesac, also known for its knotted bean bags, had about 2,000 employees total in April 2024, according to its latest proxy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p class=\"\">In December, Lovesac posted a drop in third-quarter sales to $149.9 million and guided for lower earnings and sales for fiscal 2025. The company also guided for sales to grow 7% to 12% and earnings per share to at least double in fiscal 2026, without taking into account any potential new tariffs.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Sabela Ojea at sabela.ojea@wsj.com; @sabelaojeaguix</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Paul Vieira</p><p class=\"\">OTTAWA--The threat of prolonged uncertainty hovering over Canadian businesses from President Trump's trade policy is fueling calls for Canada to make its economy more resilient and innovative and less reliant on its southern neighbor.</p><p class=\"\">Canadian executives, former officials and economists say the country requires a fresh policy rethink to mitigate the trade risk Trump poses, and counter his promise to unleash business investment and energy production in his country. About 80% of Canadian exports are U.S.-bound.</p><p class=\"\">Canada on Monday avoided a hefty 25% tariff on its U.S. imports for a 30-day period, which Trump said will be used to see if a new economic deal with Canada can be reached. The hefty tariff could be revived without a deal.</p><p class=\"\">\"The worst-case scenario is a giant U.S. tariff. The second worst scenario is ongoing uncertainty. So we have the second-worst scenario,\" said Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. \"Canadian businesses now have to sleep with one eye open.\"</p><p class=\"\">Business leaders and economists say Canada should pursue lower taxes to encourage investment and innovation, accelerated approvals for resource and infrastructure projects, and perhaps resurrected plans for new oil-and-gas pipelines in the west and east to sell the country's energy to non-U.S. markets.</p><p class=\"\">Failing to do so leaves Canada too exposed to continued trade conflicts with Trump and an increasingly protectionist U.S. Congress. Without predictable U.S. trade, Canada's economy needs other engines of growth other than housing, immigration and public-sector expansion, economists and business leaders argue.</p><p class=\"\">A survey from KPMG Canada late last month indicated that nearly half of the business leaders contacted said they plan to shift investments to the U.S. or set up production operations to secure tariff-free access to the U.S. market and reduce costs.</p><p class=\"\">Among those leading the call for a new Canadian economic vision is the chief executive of the country's largest bank. \"This is the moment to unite the country behind a long-term economic agenda-one that boosts competitiveness and drives prosperity for all,\" Dave McKay of Royal Bank of Canada said in a post on the social-networking site, LinkedIn. \"To do this, Canada must build a more resilient economy that leverages its strengths.\"</p><p class=\"\">Canadian policymakers might be listening. Canada's Liberal government decided last week to defer implementation, until 2026, of an increase in the country's capital-gains tax--a measure that business groups and executives criticized heavily as dissuading investment at an inopportune time.</p><p class=\"\">The Conservative Party, which holds a sizable lead in public-opinion polls, has vowed to scrap that tax, and pledged broadly to lower tax rates, cut the public sector and repeal environmental regulations that thwart the country's resource sector.</p><p class=\"\">Former Canadian and U.K. central banker Mark Carney, the perceived front-runner to succeed Justin Trudeau as prime minister and Liberal Party leader, is also signaling a shift in economic policy for the current governing party.</p><p class=\"\">\"The federal government spends too much, but it invests too little. Middle class taxes are too high,\" he said last month in announcing his bid to be Canada's next prime minister.</p><p class=\"\">Any tax cutting effort by Canada may further strain its public finances, with the budget deficit at historically elevated levels and debt-financing costs up 10% from a year ago, as of the third quarter of last year.</p><p class=\"\">Outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has often bragged Canada is the only Group of Seven country with free-trade agreements with all other G7 members. Economists say it's time to capitalize and diversify.</p><p class=\"\">\"There will, or should be in any event, a greater awareness in Canada that it does not have a trusted partner south of the border,\" said David Rosenberg, an economist and head of market-strategy firm Rosenberg Research.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com</p></span></div>",
