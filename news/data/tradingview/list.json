But even with their skills, extensive experience and passion, there is only so much they can do – especially in the face of operational, financial and recruitment challenges and the pressure to remain at the top of the game. AI, automation and workflow optimisation has the power to relieve some of this pressure and enable labs to focus on what they do best – driving forward the future of science.”  </p><p class=\"\">Additionally, there are growing concerns regarding the skills and expertise gap within labs; a trend that is unfortunately prevalent across STEM. Lab leaders are not only uneasy about the potential for finding, attracting and hiring the next generation of lab talent, but also retaining the experts behind the pharmaceutical and biotech sectors. </p><p class=\"\">Almost three-quarters of respondents to the Lab Leader Vision 2025 survey are worried about retaining staff, with 60% facing challenges when acquiring talent for labs too.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Alexander Saeedy</p><p class=\"\">Elizabeth Warren agrees with President Trump about something.</p><p class=\"\">The Democratic senator from Massachusetts told Trump on Tuesday that she thinks the White House should take action to stop what she said were discriminatory practices by the country's biggest banks, according to a letter from her office that was viewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p class=\"\">Trump brought the subject to the fore last month when he suggested at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase were unfairly closing conservatives' bank accounts.</p><p class=\"\">Those comments set off a political firestorm and the Senate Banking Committee convened a hearing on the matter for Wednesday.</p><p class=\"\">Warren said that her office has identified thousands of examples of consumers losing access to their bank accounts and that she wants the president to take action to stop the practice.</p><p class=\"\">\"There are times when a bank has a legitimate reason, and a legal obligation, to freeze or close a bank account,\" Warren wrote in her letter to the White House, ahead of the Senate Banking Committee hearing. \"But banks may be implementing these legal obligations in a sloppy and overbroad manner.\"</p><p class=\"\">Banks say they don't discriminate against customers on the basis of their backgrounds or beliefs. They are required by law to report suspicious activity to regulators, and they face the risk of fines and litigation if they don't close accounts with ties to criminal activity. But unexplained account closures have led conservative groups and crypto firms to allege that many Americans are being unfairly targeted.</p><p class=\"\">\"Banks are required to manage risk and satisfy their regulators, which can also restrict banks from sharing why an account has been closed,\" said Austin Anton, a spokesman for the Bank Policy Institute, an industry group for American banks. \"An important part of the solution is fixing the regulatory structure.\"</p><p class=\"\">Warren's alignment with Trump shows a growing coalition across party lines that wants to try to stop unfair account closures.</p><p class=\"\">Conservative criticism of banks has been building since banks embraced diversity policies after the murder of George Floyd in 2020. A Republican-led committee in Congress alleged that banks profiled conservative and religious Americans as potential domestic terrorists when they turned over information about thousands of customers after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.</p><p class=\"\">Progressives have their own gripes with the banking industry. Warren in her letter said the banks have been unfairly shutting down accounts linked to formerly incarcerated individuals or on the basis of their customers' religion.</p><p class=\"\">Warren identified more than 8,000 regulatory complaints from consumers who alleged their bank accounts were improperly closed over the past three years. She said most of the closures were by the four biggest U.S. banks: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo.</p><p class=\"\">She said the best way for the president to take action was to support the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal agency she helped design in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent took over as the agency's acting director and halted its enforcement and rule-making actions.</p><p class=\"\">Warren also said the White House could join with the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and other regulators to adjust anti-money-laundering rules that could be causing improper account closures.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Alexander Saeedy at alexander.saeedy@wsj.com</p></span></div>",
