The discovery cost of this increase was <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">US $14.46 per ounce </strong>(oz). The deposit itself is subdivided into six different zones: Contact, 147, 147 NE, Grey Fox South (GFS), Gibson &amp; Whiskey-Jack (WJ), shown as <em>yellow stars in </em><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><em>Figure 1</em></strong><em>. </em>An intriguing historic public government record reports that a bulk sample of 8,000 tonnes taken in 1989 from the Gibson zone ramp yielded an average grade in excess of <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">27 g/t gold. </strong>Mineralization at Grey Fox is in close proximity to the highly prolific Porcupine-Destor fault, which historically has been associated with the production of some <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">110 million ounces of gold</strong>. A complete update of the mineral resources at the Fox Complex will be published in the coming weeks.</p><p class=\"\">The increase in resources at Grey Fox can be attributed to a number of factors: exploration drilling discovering and extending new and existing gold lenses; a higher gold price used to calculate the resource, from US$1,725, used in 2021 to US$2,000 today that allowed for a lower cut-off grade, from 2.30 g/t Au to 1.60 g/t Au, which also benefited from foreign exchange rates, used in the evaluation of potential underground mining scenario shapes.</p><p class=\"\">Rob McEwen, Chairman and Chief Owner, said, <!-- -->“Our investment in exploration on the Fox Complex properties has successfully expanded our gold resources, which will enable us to both increase annual production and extend the mine life. Grey <!-- -->Fox is one of several exploration targets contributing to the growth of gold resources and enhancing the future production at our Fox Complex.” </p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Table 1. </strong>Grey Fox Mineral Resource Update as of December 31st, 2024</p><div class=\"tableWrapper-pIO_GYwT\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td>Resource</td><td>Cut-off Grade</td><td>Quantity</td><td>Grade Gold</td><td>Contained Metal</td></tr><tr><td>Classification</td><td>Gold (g/t)</td><td>('000 t)</td><td>(g/t)</td><td>Gold (oz)</td></tr><tr><td>Measured</td><td>1.60</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Indicated</td><td>1.60</td><td>13,135</td><td>3.64</td><td>1,538,000</td></tr><tr><td>Total Measured + Indicated</td><td>1.60</td><td>13,135</td><td>3.64</td><td>1,538,000</td></tr><tr><td>Inferred</td><td>1.60</td><td>4,319</td><td>3.30</td><td>458,000</td></tr><tr><td>Total Inferred </td><td>1.60</td><td>4,319</td><td>3.30</td><td>458,000</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"\">The Grey Fox deposit is located approximately 3 kilometers South-East of McEwen Mining’s Black Fox Mine and about 75 kilometers East of Timmins, Ontario, Canada (see <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Figure 1</strong>). The geology of the Fox Complex shown in <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Figure 1</strong> is highly favourable for structurally controlled gold mineralization principally due its proximity to the world-class Porcupine-Destor Fault Zone and subordinate splay faults such as the A-1 and Gibson-Kelore. In addition, there is a large intrusive porphyry (syenite) body at Grey Fox which could also have been a ‘heat-engine’ for much of the gold mineralization. Current geological modeling of Grey Fox by McEwen Mining indicates the presence of over 150 distinct mineralized lenses in an area of about 1.4 square kilometers, with many of the lenses extending to the bedrock surface. The high concentration of lenses in such a compact area may indicate a robust mineralized system at Grey Fox. This is especially evidenced at the Gibson zone, where our drilling has confirmed mineralization from near surface (&lt;25 m) down to vertical depths exceeding 800 m. In addition, the majority of these mineralized lenses remain open at depth.</p><p class=\"\">Figure 1.

The decrease in grade reflects the lower cut-off used in the calculation of mineral resources using potential underground mining scenario shapes due to an increase in the gold price used, which has risen from US$ 1,725/oz Au to US$ 2,000/oz Au. This is more than offset by the extension of existing lenses and the discovery of new ones, adding new tonnes and ounces to the resource.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Table 3</strong>.

Demand for haven assets like gold, which is testing record highs, is being boosted by uncertainty in a challenging global economic environment dominated by trade and tariff tensions between the U.S. and multiple nations, Quasar Elizundia, research strategist at Pepperstone, says in a note. U.S. job openings at the end of 2024 unexpectedly resumed their downward trend, which raises questions about the labor market's strength and its ability to withstand global economic risks, raising uncertainty for investors, Elizundia adds. Spot gold is 0.2% higher at $2,846.13/oz, and has gained 8.5% so far this year. (kimberley.kao@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
