            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">The new era of nuclear power generation greater than the force of the Sun has arrived and is ready for deployment. For the first-time ever, a sustained synthetic quasar has been born on Earth to permanently reshape all existing industries.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">SEATTLE, WA / ACCESS Newswire / February 5, 2025 /</strong> Quantum Kinetics Corporation™ (QKC), an American company, has ushered in a dramatic shift in nuclear power evolution with their unmatched discovery - Arc Reactor™ technology.</p><p class=\"\">The Company calls the process \"Safe Nuclear™.\" Quantum Kinetics' research with heavily spiked radioactive water proved that using the company's patented Quantum Kinetics Well® (QKW®), they are speeding up radioactive Beta Decay (+/-), and at the same time fabricating unique and useful atomic elements through transmutation. Tested and verified over three years at national laboratories in the United States, the power of the QKW® is far more effective than high-temperature, high-cost electrocoagulation (EC) methods for radioactive wastewater purification, or atomic transmutation from large particle accelerators (cyclotrons), and or ‘bulk-ion heating' tokamak reactors.</p><p class=\"\">The technology was discovered by McKane Lee, the visionary CEO and President of QKC. Driven by an unwavering passion for scientific advancement with limited resources, Lee embarked on a solitary journey that spanned seven years. Secluding himself within the confines of a humble garage laboratory, he meticulously worked with electronic scraps, constructing and transforming them into the cornerstone of this revolutionary technology. Thus, Lee awakened a $40 Trillion dollar industry from a mere $40 dollar toy, the Arc Reactor ™. <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">See Figure 1.</strong></p><p class=\"\">Figure 1: A synthetic pulsing quasar (blazar) born instantaneously at room temperature with a mere 1.9-watts input. QKC's patented and trademarked Arc Reactor™ shines for hours, days, weeks, and even for years. Luminosity calculations show an ‘Apparent Magnitude' of -80.67. Making the Arc Reactor™ by QKC, brighter than a cosmological gamma-ray burst or Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN).</p><p class=\"\">QKC's ingenious design incorporation of the Arc Reactor™ allows for the unique Quantum Kinetic Well® (QKW®) phenomenon, which generates instantaneous fusion temperatures safely. These localized fusion events occur at room temperature without excessive waste energy from traditional ‘bulk-ion plasma' heating. Arc Reactor™ technology triggers safe cold neutrons in contrast to characteristically unviable hot fusion approaches. Quantum Kinetics' Arc Reactor™ utilizes a unique micro-cyclotron approach, '<em>Particle Oscillations as an Energy Generator™</em>' to stimulate Safe Nuclear™ on demand. Thus, cold fusion plasma is immediately manifested resulting in high levels of X-ray energy without increasing localized thermal heat damage to the reactor, which in legacy fusion methods destroys the reactors by fast-neutron bombardment.</p><p class=\"\">Further setting QKC's vision apart from other nuclear fusion companies is its economic utility and vast opportunities for rapid deployment in any environmental setting where water is present. A key advantage of QKW® operations is sustainability at very low input power. Rigorous research reveals the revolutionary device successfully dissociates radioactive wastewater between 4.73 - 11.40 watts/sec of electrical input. A modular version of the QKW® can be economically run by a 100-watt solar panel/charge controller and a 12 or 24v battery, meaning in practical application isotope editing can be powered by the energy from the sun at almost any location around the world, an astonishing scientific feat. QKC's sustained nuclear fusion is similar to active galactic nucleus (AGN) such as all cosmic blackbody radiators (1 keV - 37.5 keV). This form of Electro-Physical Transmutation (E-PT®) energy is real, quantifiable, and measurable with state-of-the-art industry detectors (XR-110CR &amp; PulseTor SDD). Quantum Kinetics consistently replicated the nuclear phenomenon over four years of painstaking research using the water-based Quantum Kinetic Fusor™ (QKF™) device, which is a derivative design of the Arc Reactor™. Hence, the QKF™ results have been peer-reviewed in a npj<em>Nature</em>: Clean Water journal and heralded by the reviewers as \"...<em>a much-needed invention around the world.</em>\" <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">See Figure 1A.</strong></p><p class=\"\">Figure 1A: Arc Reactor™ pulsating operations values with the PulseTor SDD X-ray detector. a.)

We are the first company in history to sustain safe nuclear fusion on demand. What we are doing is completely new, unrivaled, and revolutionary. This technology will reshape and redefine energy production and consumption across all existing industries for commercial and private usage.\"</p><p class=\"\">To understand the significance of this finding consider the context of this discovery. In nature, Uranium-235 has a half-life of 700 million years. In contrast, the QKW® substantially reduces Uranium-235 in a matter of hours. With the power to neutralize hazardous water from decommissioned radioactive capsules, the QKW® represents the Alchemist's dream for controlling the periodic table. Economic implications of the iconic discovery are astonishing. The globalist from a leading nuclear research company indicated, \"<!-- -->This is impressive data. QKC could become a billion-dollar company rather quickly by treating stored nuclear wastewater at legacy and operational nuclear power plants.\"</p><p class=\"\">Commercial applications of isotope editing and the potential to generate vast amounts of clean energy are staggering. A University of Washington professor and forensic engineer stated, \"<em>I'd love to see what happens at a large scale</em>.\"</p><p class=\"\">QKC's Officers were present as participants of the recent experiments at the national laboratory and commented, \"<!-- -->This is truly extraordinary. In addition to thorium, lead, and tungsten forming from the process, we see other elements forming like boron, potassium, magnesium, gallium, and silicon. There has never been anything seen like this before, and this alone is going to give labs and classrooms around the country so much to further the discoveries of possibilities, along with the immediate commercial buildout that will ensue.\" <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">See Figure 2 &amp; Figure 2A.</strong></p><p class=\"\">Figure 2: The elements fabricated and remediated post-treatment with the Electro-Physical Transmutation (E-PT™) process.

Dangerous fast neutrons are also avoided using Safe Nuclear™.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Cost Effectiveness:</strong> Cold nuclear fusion does not require expensive materials costs like superconducting magnets, wires, fusion fuels like deuterium/tritium/helium gaseous matter. Its compact design and scalability allow for flexible deployment, enabling companies to generate clean and reliable energy on-site, reducing reliance on external energy sources and enhancing energy independence.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Deployment:</strong> This technology can be deployed anywhere in the world by solar or other energy means. This approach minimizes the risk of unplanned outages and disruptions, ensuring a steady and dependable fusion reaction at scale.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Controllability:</strong> Quantum Kinetic Fusion™ (cold nuclear fusion) allows precise control and vectoring at room-temperature, with no chance of uncontrollable thermal-runaway events from bulk ion heating.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Fuel Source:</strong> The fuel source of Quantum Kinetic Fusion™ (cold nuclear fusion) can be any dielectric medium including ambient air, water, liquid metals, gaseous matter, and even the vacuum of space. All dielectric mediums can be used for nuclear fusion or transmutation including manufacturing of tritium gaseous matter (~$30,000/gram).</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Scalability:</strong> The technology is modular and scalable, allowing for cost effective deployment and expansion of energy production in diverse settings.</p><p class=\"\">The market implications of Arc Reactor™ - cold nuclear fusion transforms businesses across all industries. This new technological discovery optimizes operations, reduces energy costs, and establishes a new competitive edge in a global economy increasingly driven by sustainability. <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">See Figure 3.</strong></p><p class=\"\">Figure 3.

(ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0309 GMT - China's countermeasures to impose tariffs on U.S. energy products should have limited impact, Citi analysts Oscar Yee and Desmond Law say in a research note. The U.S. only accounted for around 2% and 6% of China's 2024 crude oil and liquefied natural gas imports, respectively, making it easy to diversify to other sources, they say. The analysts note market focus should be on whether Beijing imposes further tariffs on ethane, propane and polyethylene, which could have much bigger impact, given that the U.S. represents around 99%, 59% and 17%, respectively, of China's 2024 imports. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0248 GMT - China's tariffs announced Tuesday may have limited near-term impact on energy prices, Goldman Sachs commodities analysts say in a research report. \"Neither global supply nor demand of these commodities are changed by China's tariffs,\" the analysts say. \"Impacted U.S. volumes are likely to easily find alternative buying markets, while China replaces impacted import volumes with alternative suppliers,\" they add. However, there could be a potential pause in new long-term liquefied natural gas contract talks between China buyers and U.S. LNG facilities. Given that most proposed U.S. LNG facilities require that a substantial portion of their capacity is contracted under long-term deals to obtain financing, such a pause might delay new U.S. LNG export facilities reaching a final investment decision, the analysts add. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0129 GMT - Oil futures edge higher in Asian trading. However, near-term prices for global crude oil are likely to remain capped due to supply risks and potential trade challenges, says Hassan Fawaz, GivTrade's chairman and founder. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China may also affect demand levels, he says. Caution could dominate, leading to pressure on oil prices, he says. Front-month WTI crude oil futures rise 0.2% to $72.85/bbl; front-month Brent crude oil futures are up 0.1% at $76.28/bbl. (amanda.lee@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">2328 GMT - Are China's 15% tariffs on U.S. coal meaningful for coal markets? That's the question posed by Morgan Stanley, which concludes any impact would be mostly be felt in metallurgical coal prices. Commodities strategist Helen Amos says China accounts for a relatively small share of U.S. coal exports. Still, U.S. exports of thermal and metallurgical coal to China increased over 2024. Morgan Stanley estimates tariffs would raise costs for around 3.4 million tons of thermal coal, representing less than 1% of traded volumes, and around 10.7 million tons of metallurgical coal, or some 3% of traded volumes. \"We see negligible or only modest potential price impact of China's coal import tariffs, given both coal markets are currently well supplied,\" Morgan Stanley says. \"But we watch for more meaningful shifts in met coal trade flows.\" (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)</p><p class=\"\">2318 GMT - Risks to Macquarie's balance sheet from its investments in renewable energy look manageable to Morgan Stanley. Analyst Andrei Stadnik estimates some A$2 billion of Macquarie's principal investments, or 18%, are in green energy. Still, only 10% of investments by Corio--Macquarie's unit focused on offshore wind-energy developments--are in the U.S. and exposed to policy shifts by the Trump administration. \"Elsewhere, we estimate Macquarie booked a A$50 million gain on sale of Formosa 2 offshore wind in Asia, so offshore wind transactions are continuing,\" Morgan Stanley says. \"Nonetheless, we have baked in a A$150 million 2H impairment charge for principal investments in renewables.\" (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)</p><p class=\"\">1917 GMT - Oil futures put in a mixed performance with Chinese retaliatory tariffs on U.S. LNG and oil pressuring U.S. benchmark crude. WTI settles down 0.6% at $72.70 a barrel, while international benchmark Brent edges up 0.3% to $76.20 a barrel. The Chinese tariff on $5 billion of U.S. energy imports suggests a \"softer tone of the response\" to the U.S. tariffs, Alex Hodes of StoneX says in a note. \"The tariffs are also not expected to come into play until Feb. 10, leaving room for negotiations between the two nations.\" (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1906 GMT - U.S. natural gas futures lose ground, but end above the day's lows as weather forecasts shift between colder and milder. The impact of China's decision to slap a 15% retaliatory tariff on imports of U.S. LNG is difficult to gauge, forecaster NatGasWeather.com says in a note. \"Weather trends the next few days will continue to be very important and are likely to dictate the direction of trade.\" The Nymex front month settles down 3% at $3.253/mmBtu. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1336 GMT - U.S. natural gas futures hand back some of the previous day's gains as weather forecasts continue to vary over how cold February is likely to be. China announced a 15% tariff to be placed on imports of U.S. LNG as of Feb. 10, in response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. \"In the immediate term, Chinese offtakers may shy away from U.S.-sourced spot LNG purchases--but U.S. LNG may simply backfill other Asian supply that China lifts instead,\" Eli Rubin of EBW Analytics says in a note. The tariffs could affect longer-term contracting, however, he adds. The Nymex front month is down 5.2% at $3.177/mmBtu. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1425 GMT - Crude prices extend losses in midday trade amid heightened fears of a trade war between the U.S. and China that could hurt global growth and increase inflationary pressures. Brent crude is down 2.3% to $74.22 a barrel, while WTI falls 3.3% to $70.75 a barrel. Both benchmarks erased all the previous session's gains, also due to easing concerns over immediate disruption of Canadian and Mexican oil flows after U.S. President Trump agreed to hold off imposing tariffs on the two neighboring countries. \"The next key support levels to watch are $69.50 and $66,\" says Razan Hilal, market analyst at Forex. \"A deeper decline could signal the start of a more extended bearish trend.\" (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1310 GMT - Oil futures are lower as China retaliates against U.S. tariffs with duties on U.S. exports including oil and LNG, to take effect Feb. 10. The tariff is particularly negative for WTI, says TP ICAP's Scott Shelton in a note. \"I would assume with a $7 tax roughly, that arb is firmly shut and WTI will have to go elsewhere in the next few months as we go into turnarounds.\" U.S. refineries reduce their crude use during the maintenance season, leading to builds in U.S. crude stocks. WTI is down 2.7% at $71.16 a barrel. Brent is 1.8% lower at $74.61 a barrel. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1245 GMT - China's counter tariffs on U.S. imports aren't expected to have a significant impact on the oil market, according to Commerzbank Research. Beijing said it would impose a 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas products as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil and other products such as agricultural machinery, effective on Feb. 10. \"As China only sourced 1.8% of its crude oil imports from the U.S. last year, the impact on the oil market should be limited,\" commodity analyst Carsten Fritsch says in a note.
