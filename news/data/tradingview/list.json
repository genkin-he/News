The GSA is a federal government agency that manages federal property and provides contracting services.</p><p class=\"\">Musk’s aides, including Farritor, have requested access to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services systems that control contracts and the more than $1 trillion in payments that go out annually, according to the Times.</p><p class=\"\">Farritor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p class=\"\">EDWARD CORISTINE</p><p class=\"\">According to Wired magazine, Edward Coristine appears to have recently graduated from high school and to have been enrolled at Northeastern University.

The stock is up 18.6% over the past 12 months.</p><p class=\"\">Ahead of the results, analysts were focused on whether the chain could keep up same-store sales growth this year, following solid trends last year, as shoppers grappling with higher costs of living remain picky about dining out.</p><p class=\"\">Some analysts said tougher comparisons, harsher weather and holiday timing may have put pressure on Chipotle's recent sales. But while fast-food chains, after raising prices, have tried to win back consumers with value deals, some analysts say customers believe they can get a better meal at fast-casual chains for a price that's not much higher.</p><p class=\"\">Chipotle's management, during the call, said they were focused on opening more restaurants internationally, while outfitting its new restaurants with upgraded equipment - like rice cookers, faster-cooking grills and fryers that can fry more chips - that can help with faster, more consistent service. The company has a goal to open 7,000 restaurants in North America.</p><p class=\"\">Executives said they planned to launch a new limited-time menu offering around mid- to late March, and expressed excitement about menu items to come later in the year.

Jobless claims on Thursday are expected to accelerate and Friday's payrolls increases are expected to slow.

For now, there is \"little in today's data to alter the course of Fed policy,\" the Barclays team says. But they add that with a lower ratio of job openings to unemployed workers, it's becoming more likely that any further decline in labor demand would push up the unemployment rate in the months ahead.

The outlook is patchy for 2025, even without considering possible impact of an anti-immigrant policy under the Trump administration, BBVA's Juan José Li Ng says in a note. BBVA's base case is that remittances will grow 3% this year, \"but with a downward bias given signs of less absorption of Mexican labor in the U.S. over the past year,\" he says.

Studying data over the pandemic and postpandemic period, Maximiliano Dvorkin and Cassie Marks find that during the stretch of high inflation and low unemployment during 2022, wage increases became more likely and larger in scale. Then, they cooled again as the labor market started to normalize in 2023. In 2022, for example, they find that workers had a 55% probability of a positive wage increase, up from 43% in the years before the pandemic. Wage increases fell in likelihood to 53% in 2023, they find. Economists closely study the interconnection between inflation and wages in part to better understand how likely inflation is to become self perpetuating.

While public security remained the top perceived obstacle to growth, the percentage of analysts citing foreign trade policy rose to 13% from 7% in the previous survey.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Malaysian planters may post strong 4Q 2024 results, driven by higher upstream earnings from improved palm product prices, though downstream performance may remain weak, especially in refining, Hong Leong IB analyst Chye Wen Fei says in a note. Planters with greater upstream exposure in Indonesia should fare better due to better production, she reckons. Chye maintains her 2025-2026 CPO price assumptions at MYR4,000/ton and MYR3,800/ton, respectively, expecting elevated prices through 1Q amid weak output. Hong Leong maintains a neutral rating on Malaysian plantation sector as high CPO prices may not hold beyond 1Q. It has Johor Plantations, Hap Seng Plantations and IOI Corp. as its top picks.
