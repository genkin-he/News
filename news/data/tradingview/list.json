The bank suggests traders to consider long positions if prices adjust. Meanwhile, Malaysia's palm oil production is expected to remain weak due to heavy rainfall. January output is estimated to have declined 10% from the previous month to 1.34 million tons, marking a fifth consecutive decline, according to a Bloomberg survey. Inventories may have dropped 2.9% to 1.66 million tons, while exports likely slumped 14.2% to 1.15 million tons, the survey shows. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board will release official data on Monday. AmInvestment Bank pegs CPO support at 4,251 ringgit/ton and resistance at 4,453 ringgit/ton. The Bursa Malaysia Derivatives contract for April delivery is 23 ringgit higher at 4,331 ringgit/ton.

Japanese data released earlier showed the economy's real wages rose 0.6% in December from a year earlier, marking a second straight month of increases. A solid rise in Japanese labor cash earnings will reinforce the current market pricing in at least one more rate hike by the BOJ this year, CBA's Joseph Capurso says in a note. In addition, with the 'tariff war' between the U.S. and other countries seemingly ongoing, the AUD/JPY is likely to retest support at 94.69, the head of International and Sustainable Economics adds. USD/JPY falls 0.6% to 153.36; AUD/JPY drops 0.7% to 95.88. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

January data point to a solid upturn in business activity across the sector, accompanied by a steeper, solid rise in new business inflows. The survey signaled a sharp jump in average prices charged by service providers, while exports rose for the first time in four months. Firms are upbeat on their prospects over the coming 12 months and have boosted staffing levels, says Usamah Bhatti, economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Services continue to underpin growth in Japan's private sector, contrasting the weakness in manufacturing. Still, companies are confident that private-sector activity will rise over 2025, expecting a rebound in manufacturing output and a broad-based economic recovery, Bhatti says.

Mark Smith, senior economist at ASB Bank expects demand for labor will continue to weaken until a modest economic recovery finally shows up in the second half of 2025. Firms will have to carefully manage employee headcount in that time, he adds. With inflation close to the target midpoint and monetary settings still slowing the economy, further swift monetary easing looks appropriate to limit economic and labor market scarring, he adds.
