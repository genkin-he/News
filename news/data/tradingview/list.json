If the 10% levy is maintained for the rest of 2025, that would shave around 0.5% off China's GDP growth, he says. But if tariffs are raised to 20% to 30%, that would likely drag China's economic growth this year to 4.0% from 5.0% last year, he adds. That said, Beijing's retaliation, with targeted tariffs aimed at U.S. exports amounting to only $14 billion, leaves the door open for a potential deal with Washington to avert a broader trade war, he adds.

On the occasion, Patrick Pouyanné said:</p><p class=\"\">\"During the fourth quarter, TotalEnergies leveraged its multi-energy integrated model, benefiting notably from strong performance in Integrated LNG and Integrated Power, with $4.4 billion of adjusted net income, up 8% compared to the third quarter, and $7.2 billion of CFFO, up 5%.</p><p class=\"\">In 2024, TotalEnergies reported adjusted net income of $18.3 billion and cash flow of $29.9 billion in a softer environment mainly affected by a sharp decline in refining margins, after two exceptional years. 2024 IFRS net income was $15.8 billion (EUR14.6 billion). The Company achieved nearly a 15% return on average capital employed in 2024, the best among the majors for the third consecutive year. TotalEnergies continued to implement its balanced growth strategy in a disciplined manner by investing $17.8 billion in 2024, of which one third was in new Oil &amp; Gas projects and $4.8 billion in low-carbon energies, including $3.9 billion in Integrated Power. With $8 billion in share buybacks*, payout reached 50% of cash flow. TotalEnergies ended the year with gearing below 10%, highlighting the Company's strong financial health.</p><p class=\"\">In the Oil &amp; Gas business, fourth quarter production was 2.43 Mboe/d, benefiting from the ramp up of projects commencing in 2024. With oil prices down $5/b compared to previous quarter, partially offset by higher gas prices, Exploration &amp; Production delivered a strong quarter, with adjusted net operating income of $2.3 billion and cash flow of $3.9 billion. In 2024, TotalEnergies achieved five major projects start-ups (Mero-2 and Mero-3 in Brazil, Anchor in the United States, Fenix in Argentina and Tyra in Denmark) that support 2025 production growth of more than 3%. Exploration &amp; Production generated adjusted net operating income of $10 billion and cash flow of $17 billion. During the year, the Company sanctioned major oil projects in Suriname, Brazil and Angola, driving an outstanding reserves replacement ratio (157%) and a proved reserves life index greater than 12 years, reflecting the depth of TotalEnergies' Upstream portfolio. In 2024, TotalEnergies confirmed its low cost and low emission O&amp;G model, with operating costs below $5/boe and GHG emissions and notably methane emissions down 3% and 15%, respectively, over the year.</p><p class=\"\">Integrated LNG results meaningfully increased sequentially with adjusted net operating income and cash flow of $1.4 billion, up 35% and 63%, respectively, compared to the third quarter, driven by 6% production growth, average LNG prices above $10/Mbtu and LNG trading performance back to the level of the fourth quarter 2023, taking advantage of higher market volatility. For full-year 2024, Integrated LNG generated adjusted net operating income and cash flow of $4.9 billion. The Company enriched its portfolio in 2024 with the launch of Marsa LNG in Oman, Ubeta in Nigeria, the Sapura OMV acquisition in Malaysia and the acquisition of dry gas assets in the Eagle Ford basin in Texas. Moreover, TotalEnergies continued to successfully market its LNG volumes by signing several new medium-term sales contracts (6 Mt/ year) in Asia, mostly Brent-indexed.</p><p class=\"\">During the fourth quarter, Integrated Power continued its track record of strong performance throughout the year with a higher adjusted net operating income of $575 million and cash flow of $604 million. Full-year 2024 cash flow totaled $2.6 billion, up 19% year-on-year and in line with annual Company guidance, and with a ROACE of 10%. Net electricity production increased 23% year-on-year to 41 TWh and contributed to reducing the average lifecycle carbon intensity of all energy products sold by the Company to its clients (-17% vs. 2015). During 2024, TotalEnergies continued to deploy its differentiated Integrated Power model in key targeted markets through strategic acquisitions: Quadra Energy and VSB that strengthen the Company's position in Germany, and gas-fired power plants in the United States and the United Kingdom that further enhance the Company's flexible generation capacity. Thanks to its portfolio, TotalEnergies anticipates growing power production to more than 50 TWh in 2025, equivalent to 10% of its hydrocarbon production.</p><p class=\"\">During the fourth quarter, in a globally weak margin environment, Downstream adjusted net operating income was $680 million, up 12%, and cash flow was $1.4 billion, up 15%, following a $10/t increase in European refining margins. Full-year 2024 adjusted net operating income was $3.5 billion, down from 2023 levels due to a sharp decline (-44%) in European refining margins and downgraded operations in some units. Importantly, cash flow remained above $6 billion, demonstrating the resilience of the Company's integrated Downstream model.</p><p class=\"\">In view of the free cash flow growth outlook and share buybacks executed in 2024 (5% of the share capital), the Board of Directors will propose at the Shareholders' Meeting to be held on May 23, 2025, the distribution of a final 2024 dividend of EUR0.85/share, resulting in an increase of 7% for the 2024 dividend to EUR3.22/share, compared to the 2023 dividend.

Outlook</p><p class=\"\">At the beginning of 2025, Brent prices remain volatile between $70 and $80/b, supported by the willingness of OPEC+ countries to balance oil markets that are facing strong supply growth from non-OPEC countries (US, Guyana, Brazil). According to the IEA, global oil demand is anticipated to grow by 1.1 Mb/d in 2025, up from a 0.8 Mb/d increase in 2024.</p><p class=\"\">European gas prices increased at the end of 2024 and forward markets currently expect prices to be above $13/Mbtu in the first quarter of 2025, supported by high winter consumption and rapid inventory declines in Europe in the context of the interruption of Russian imports via Ukraine. Gas markets should remain in tension in 2025 due to very limited expected capacity additions related to delays of some projects. TotalEnergies expects more than 40 Mt of LNG sales in 2025. Given the evolution of oil and gas prices in the recent months and the lag effect on price formulas, TotalEnergies anticipates its average LNG selling price will be above $10/Mbtu in the first quarter 2025.</p><p class=\"\">In 2025, TotalEnergies anticipates its hydrocarbon production will grow more than 3%, benefiting from the ramp-up of 2024 start-ups and production start-ups, notably Ballymore in the Gulf of Mexico and Mero-4 in Brazil.</p><p class=\"\">First quarter 2025 hydrocarbon production is expected to be between 2.5 and 2.55 Mboe/d thanks to the ramp-up of 2024 start-ups and the closing of the acquisitions of SapuraOMV in Malaysia and of interests in the Eagle Ford shale gas play in Texas that occurred during the fourth quarter 2024.</p><p class=\"\">The Integrated Power segment is expected to expand in 2025 supported by electricity production growth greater than 20% to reach an annual net electricity generation of more than 50 TWh. Cash flow before working capital (CFFO) is expected to be between $2.5 and $3 billion in 2025.</p><p class=\"\">By combining hydrocarbon and electricity production growth, the Company expects to increase energy production by 5% in 2025. Integrated Power production will represent 10% of hydrocarbon production.</p><p class=\"\">For 2025, TotalEnergies expects net investments of $17 to $17.5 billion, of which $4.5 billion is dedicated to low carbon energies, mostly Integrated Power. Organic investments should amount to approximately $17 billion, focused on core growth projects to achieve 2030 production targets, down from the $18 billion guidance presented during the Strategy &amp; Outlook in October 2024.</p><p class=\"\">* * * *</p><p class=\"\">To listen to the conference call with Chairman &amp; CEO Patrick Pouyanné and CFO Jean-Pierre Sbraire today at 3:00pm (Paris time), please log on to totalenergies.com or dial +33 (0) 1 70 37 71 66, +44 (0) 33 0551 0200 or +1 786 697 3501.

This enabled us to achieve significant cost savings, deliver strong cash flow, and implement a comprehensive product launch program for the 2025 season.</p><p class=\"\">Challenging market conditions in the fourth quarter</p><p class=\"\">The year's challenging market situation continued into the fourth quarter, with subsequently lower consumer demand. The Group's sales declined organically by 3% and the operating income, excluding items affecting comparability, amounted to SEK -694m (-168) for the fourth quarter.</p><p class=\"\">In the Husqvarna Forest &amp; Garden Division, organic growth was unchanged for the quarter, with growth in handheld and wheeled products, as well as in parts and accessories. Sales in the Gardena Division decreased, with growth for hand tools, while sales of watering products declined. In the Husqvarna Construction Division, sales declined in North America due to a continuation of the challenging market situation, however, our sales increased in Europe.</p><p class=\"\">Strong cash flow and reduced net debt</p><p class=\"\">For the full year 2024, operating income, excluding items affecting comparability, amounted to SEK 3.2bn (5.0). The decrease was due to lower sales volumes with higher promotional activities and a negative product mix. This was partly offset by good results from savings programs, which generated SEK 735m. Direct operating cash flow increased to SEK 6.9bn (6.5), driven by substantial inventory reductions. We have reduced net debt by SEK 1.2bn compared to last year. The Board will propose to the Annual General Meeting a dividend of SEK 1.00 (3.00) for the year, in line with our dividend policy, representing 32% of earnings per share excluding items affecting comparability, or 43% of earnings per share.</p><p class=\"\">Improving results in North America</p><p class=\"\">In recent years, the Husqvarna Forest &amp; Garden Division has taken decisive actions to improve results in North America. Low-margin business has been discontinued and the production structure has been consolidated. We are now entering the next step where we divest our manufacturing facility in Orangeburg, SC, to Flex Ltd. In parallel, we have entered a long-term supplier agreement with Flex, to ensure continued production of the division's wheeled products and assembly of handheld products in the US. This is a partnership that will build profitability, improve capital efficiency, enhance production flexibility and strengthen our competitiveness in North America. Related cost savings are expected to amount to SEK 350m by 2030 (see page 9).</p><p class=\"\">Our strategic transformation continues</p><p class=\"\">Our long-term transformation is about delivering value to customers, shareholders and employees through growth in the focus areas; robotic mowers, battery-powered products, watering and solutions for the professional market. Since 2021 we measure our progress through operational ambitions, including share of electrification, number of connected devices, and sales of robotic mowers. During the year, the share of electrified products reached 44% (42) of our sales of motorized products. Connected devices grew to 4.9 million (4.5). For robotic mowers, net sales amounted to SEK 7.2bn (8.1). We strengthened our position and grew in the professional robotics market. However, sales in the residential segment declined due to increased competition in the low-value segments, as well as restrained consumer spending, particularly for the high value segments. For the 2025 season, we have significantly expanded our range with new boundary wire-free robotic mowers.</p><p class=\"\">As the current strategic period for the Group approaches its end, our focus remains firm — we are continuing to prioritize areas with profitable growth potential, and we will present an update of our strategy at a Capital Markets Day in the fourth quarter of 2025.</p><p class=\"\">We deliver on our sustainability targets</p><p class=\"\">Our ambition to electrify the product range is the main enabler to consistently reduce our carbon footprint. To date, we have reduced CO(2) emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) by -56% compared with the base year of 2015. With that, we have exceeded our target of a -35% reduction by 2025. Work to reduce CO(2) emissions is continuing and includes exploring alternative fuels for some of our products.</p><p class=\"\">I would like to express my gratitude to all colleagues and business partners for their efforts and support during the year. Together, we will continue to focus on opportunities in the market, strengthen our position and aim to increase our profitability. Our cost-saving efforts are successful, and we are well prepared for the 2025 season, with a strong product range and many exciting launches for our customers.\"</p><p class=\"\">Pavel Hajman, CEO</p><p class=\"\">Webcast presentation and telephone conference</p><p class=\"\">A webcast presentation of the Q4 report hosted by Pavel Hajman, CEO and Terry Burke, CFO will be held at 10:00 CET on February 5, 2025.</p><p class=\"\">To view the presentation, please use the link: https://husqvarnagroup.creo.se/4f888317-fb0e-4ca4-9abd-4d677a0dda92</p><p class=\"\">The dial-in to the telephone conference (in order to ask questions): +46 (0) 8 505 100 31 (Sweden) or +44 207 107 06 13 (UK)</p><p class=\"\">Dates for Financial Reports 2025</p><p class=\"\">April 24           Interim report for January-March 2025</p><p class=\"\">April 29           Annual General Meeting 2025</p><p class=\"\">July 18            Interim report for January-June 2025</p><p class=\"\">October 21      Interim report for January-September 2025</p><p class=\"\">Contacts</p><p class=\"\">Terry Burke, CFO and Executive Vice President, Finance, IR &amp; Communication</p><p class=\"\">+46 8 738 90 00</p><p class=\"\">Johan Andersson, Vice President, Investor Relations</p><p class=\"\">+46 702 100 451</p><p class=\"\">Husqvarna AB (publ), P.O.

The bank said it plans to start with a new program of about 1.59 billion euros on Thursday for which it already obtained regulatory authorization.</p><p class=\"\">Its plans came hot on the heels of buyback announcements on Tuesday from UBS Group, Intesa Sanpaolo and BNP Paribas.</p><p class=\"\">Santander said it was confident it would be able to boost profitability again in 2025, raising a key profitability target despite projecting broadly stable revenue for the year.</p><p class=\"\">Net profit for the fourth quarter was 3.265 billion euros, up 11% on year, Santander said.</p><p class=\"\">Total income for the quarter rose 10% to 16.03 billion euros, mainly driven by higher net fee income.
