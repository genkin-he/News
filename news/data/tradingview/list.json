In the last few weeks, U.S. Steel announced a $50-a-ton price increase for flat-rolled steel, and Nucor raised its price by $25 a ton.

As a global leader in payments and financial technology, the company helps clients achieve best-in-class results through a commitment to innovation and excellence in areas including account processing and digital banking solutions; card issuer processing and network services; payments; e-commerce; merchant acquiring and processing; and the Clover(R) cloud-based point-of-sale and business management platform.

Visit fiserv.com and follow on social media for more information and the latest company news.</p><p class=\"\">Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures</p><p class=\"\">In this news release, the company supplements its reporting of information determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), such as revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Fiserv, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, with \"adjusted revenue,\" \"adjusted revenue growth,\" \"organic revenue,\" \"organic revenue growth,\" \"adjusted operating income,\" \"adjusted operating margin,\" \"adjusted net income,\" \"adjusted earnings per share,\" \"adjusted earnings per share growth,\" and \"free cash flow.\" Management believes that adjustments for certain non-cash or other items and the exclusion of certain pass-through revenue and expenses should enhance shareholders' ability to evaluate the company's performance, as such measures provide additional insights into the factors and trends affecting its business. Therefore, the company excludes these items from its GAAP financial measures to calculate these unaudited non-GAAP measures. The corresponding reconciliations of these unaudited non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this news release, except for forward-looking measures where a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of the non-cash and other items described below that are excluded from the non-GAAP outlook measures. See page 15 for additional information regarding the company's forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures.</p><p class=\"\">Examples of non-cash or other items may include, but are not limited to, non-cash intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions; non-cash impairment and terminated pension plan settlement charges; severance costs; merger and integration costs; gains or losses from the sale of businesses, certain assets or investments; and certain discrete tax benefits and expenses. The company excludes these items to more clearly focus on the factors management believes are pertinent to the company's operations, and management uses this information to make operating decisions, including the allocation of resources to the company's various businesses.</p><p class=\"\">The company adjusts its non-GAAP results to exclude amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Management believes that the adjustment of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization supplements GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the comparability of operating performance. Although the company excludes amortization from acquisition-related intangible assets from its non-GAAP expenses, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation.</p><p class=\"\">Management believes organic revenue growth is useful because it presents revenue growth excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions, dispositions and the impact of the company's postage reimbursements. Management believes free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for debt service requirements and strategic capital decisions. Management believes this supplemental information enhances shareholders' ability to evaluate and understand the company's core business performance.</p><p class=\"\">These unaudited non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Fiserv, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities or any other amount determined in accordance with GAAP.</p><p class=\"\">Forward-Looking Statements</p><p class=\"\">This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding anticipated organic revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted earnings per share growth and other statements regarding our future financial performance.

Earnings per share is calculated using actual, unrounded amounts. <br/> <br/>(1)    Represents acquisition and related integration costs incurred in <br/>       connection with acquisitions. Merger and integration costs associated <br/>       with integration activities for the full year 2024 primarily include <br/>       $23 million of third-party professional service fees, $22 million of <br/>       share-based compensation, and $14 million related to a legal <br/>       settlement. Merger and integration costs associated with integration <br/>       activities for the full year 2023 primarily include $70 million of <br/>       third-party professional service fees and $35 million of share-based <br/>       compensation. <br/>(2)    Represents amortization of intangible assets acquired through <br/>       acquisition, including customer relationships, software/technology and <br/>       trade names. This adjustment does not exclude the amortization of other <br/>       intangible assets such as contract costs (sales commissions and <br/>       deferred conversion costs), capitalized and purchased software, <br/>       financing costs and debt discounts. See additional information on page <br/>       14 for an analysis of the company's amortization expense. <br/>(3)    Represents the company's share of amortization of acquisition-related <br/>       intangible assets at its unconsolidated affiliates, as well as the <br/>       minority interest share of amortization of acquisition-related <br/>       intangible assets at its subsidiaries in which the company holds a <br/>       controlling financial interest. <br/>(4)    Represents a non-cash impairment of certain equity method investments <br/>       during 2024, primarily related to the company's Wells Fargo Merchant <br/>       Services joint venture, recorded within loss from investments in <br/>       unconsolidated affiliates in the consolidated statement of income. <br/>(5)    Represents a non-cash settlement charge associated with the <br/>       terminations of the company's defined benefit pension plans in the <br/>       United Kingdom and United States. Settlements of the terminated plans <br/>       were completed in the fourth quarter of 2024. <br/>(6)    Represents a net gain for the full year primarily associated with the <br/>       sale of the company's financial reconciliation business during 2023. <br/>(7)    Represents the impact of a multi-year retroactive Canadian tax law <br/>       change, enacted in June 2023, related to the Goods and Services Tax / <br/>       Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) treatment of payment card services. <br/>(8)    The tax impact of adjustments is calculated using a tax rate of 20% for <br/>       both the full year 2024 and 2023, which approximates the company's <br/>       annual effective tax rate, exclusive of actual tax impacts of an <br/>       aggregate $196 million benefit associated with the impairment of <br/>       certain equity method investments and the settlement charge for <br/>       terminated pension plans during 2024, and a $48 million provision <br/>       associated with the net gain on sale of businesses during 2023. <br/>(9)    On December 12, 2023, the Argentina government announced economic <br/>       reforms, including a significant devaluation of the Argentine Peso. <br/>       This adjustment represents the corresponding one-day foreign currency <br/>       exchange loss from the remeasurement of the company's Argentina <br/>       subsidiary's monetary assets and liabilities in Argentina's highly <br/>       inflationary economy. <br/> <br/> <br/>                              Fiserv, Inc. <br/>                      Financial Results by Segment <br/>

Management believes that the adjustment of <br/>       acquisition-related intangible asset amortization supplements the GAAP <br/>       information with a measure that can be used to assess the comparability <br/>       of operating performance. Although the company excludes amortization <br/>       from acquisition-related intangible assets from its non-GAAP expenses, <br/>       management believes that it is important for investors to understand <br/>       that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase <br/>       accounting and contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of <br/>       intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future <br/>       periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any <br/>       future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional <br/>       intangible assets. <br/> </pre><p class=\"\">Fiserv, Inc.</p><p class=\"\">Full Year Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures</p><p class=\"\">Reconciliations of unaudited non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this news release, except for forward-looking measures where a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of these items that are excluded from the non-GAAP outlook measures.

By changing how people, food, and things move through cities, Uber is a platform that opens up the world to new possibilities.</p><p class=\"\">Forward-Looking Statements</p><p class=\"\">This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business expectations which involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by terms such as \"anticipate, \" \"believe,\" \"contemplate,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"hope,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"might,\" \"objective,\" \"ongoing,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"should,\" \"target,\" \"will,\" or \"would\" or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors relate to, among others: competition, managing our growth and corporate culture, financial performance, investments in new products or offerings, our ability to attract drivers, consumers and other partners to our platform, our brand and reputation and other legal and regulatory developments, particularly with respect to our relationships with drivers and couriers and the impact of the global economy, including rising inflation and interest rates. For additional information on other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted, please see our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and subsequent annual reports, quarterly reports and other filings filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of the date of this press release and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Financial Measures</p><p class=\"\">To supplement our financial information, which is prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA; Free cash flow; Non-GAAP Costs and Operating Expenses as well as, revenue growth rates in constant currency. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.</p><p class=\"\">We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.</p><p class=\"\">There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. In light of these limitations, we provide specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP.</p><p class=\"\">For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the sections titled \"Key Terms for Our Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures,\" \"Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures\" and \"Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures\" included at the end of this release. In regards to forward looking non-GAAP guidance, we are not able to reconcile the forward-looking non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA measure to the closest corresponding GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of certain significant items. These items include, but are not limited to, significant legal settlements, unrealized gains and losses on equity investments, tax and regulatory reserve changes, restructuring costs and acquisition and financing related impacts.</p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"> <br/>                         UBER TECHNOLOGIES, INC. <br/>                  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED

Terms for Our Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding (i) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, (ii) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax, (iii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iv) income (loss) from equity method investments, (v) interest expense, (vi) other income (expense), net, (vii) depreciation and amortization, (viii) stock-based compensation expense, (ix) certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements, (x) goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets, (xi) acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses, (xii) restructuring and related charges and (xiii) other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA margin. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Gross Bookings. We define incremental margin as the change in Adjusted EBITDA between periods divided by the change in Gross Bookings between periods.</p><p class=\"\">Aggregate Driver and Courier Earnings. Aggregate Driver and Courier Earnings refers to fares (net of Uber service fee, taxes and tolls), tips, Driver incentives and Driver benefits.</p><p class=\"\">Driver(s). The term Driver collectively refers to independent providers of ride or delivery services who use our platform to provide Mobility or Delivery services, or both.</p><p class=\"\">Driver or restaurant earnings. Driver or restaurant earnings refer to the net portion of the fare or the net portion of the order value that a Driver or a restaurant retains, respectively. These are generally included in aggregate Drivers and Couriers earnings.</p><p class=\"\">Driver incentives. Driver incentives refer to payments that we make to Drivers, which are separate from and in addition to the Driver's portion of the fare paid by the consumer after we retain our service fee to Drivers. For example, Driver incentives could include payments we make to Drivers should they choose to take advantage of an incentive offer and complete a consecutive number of trips or a cumulative number of trips on the platform over a defined period of time. Driver incentives are recorded as a reduction of revenue or cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. These incentives are generally included in aggregate Drivers and Couriers earnings.</p><p class=\"\">Free cash flow. Free cash flow is a Non-GAAP measure. We define free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures.</p><p class=\"\">Gross Bookings. We define Gross Bookings as the total dollar value, including any applicable taxes, tolls, and fees, of: Mobility rides, Delivery orders (in each case without any adjustment for consumer discounts and refunds, Driver and Merchant earnings, and Driver incentives) and Freight revenue. Gross Bookings do not include tips earned by Drivers. Gross Bookings are an indication of the scale of our current platform, which ultimately impacts revenue.</p><p class=\"\">Monthly Active Platform Consumers (\"MAPCs\"). We define MAPCs as the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility ride or received a Delivery order on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer can use multiple product offerings on our platform in a given month, that unique consumer is counted as only one MAPC.</p><p class=\"\">Revenue Margin. We define Revenue Margin as revenue as a percentage of Gross Bookings.</p><p class=\"\">Segment Adjusted EBITDA. We define each segment's Adjusted EBITDA as segment revenue less direct costs and expenses of that segment as well as any applicable exclusions from Adjusted EBITDA.</p><p class=\"\">Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin. We define each segment's Adjusted EBITDA margin as the segment Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of segment Gross Bookings.</p><p class=\"\">Trips. We define Trips as the number of completed consumer Mobility rides and Delivery orders in a given period. For example, an UberX Share ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three passengers represents one Trip. We believe that Trips are a useful metric to measure the scale and usage of our platform.</p><p class=\"\">Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures</p><p class=\"\">We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business and assess our performance. In addition to revenue, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use: Adjusted EBITDA; Free cash flow; Non-GAAP Costs and Operating Expenses; as well as, revenue growth rates in constant currency, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures because they are key measures used by our management to evaluate our operating performance. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. Our calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA</p><p class=\"\">We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding (i) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, (ii) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax, (iii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iv) income (loss) from equity method investments, (v) interest expense, (vi) other income (expense), net, (vii) depreciation and amortization, (viii) stock-based compensation expense, (ix) certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements, (x) goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets, (xi) acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses, (xii) restructuring and related charges and (xiii) other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance.</p><p class=\"\">We have included Adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain non-cash expenses and certain variable charges.</p><p class=\"\">Legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements</p><p class=\"\">Legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements are primarily related to certain significant legal proceedings or governmental investigations related to worker classification definitions, or tax agencies challenging our non-income tax positions. These matters have limited precedent, cover extended historical periods and are unpredictable in both magnitude and timing, therefore are distinct from normal, recurring legal, tax and regulatory matters and related expenses incurred in our ongoing operating performance.</p><p class=\"\">Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the following:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as   depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible   assets, and although these are non-cash charges, the assets being   depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and   Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash capital expenditure   requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure   requirements;     </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has   been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant   recurring expense in our business and an important part of our   compensation strategy;     </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain restructuring and related charges,   part of which may be settled in cash;     </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBITDA excludes other items not indicative of our ongoing   operating performance;     </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect period to period changes in taxes,   income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;     </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the components of other income   (expense), net, which primarily includes: interest income; foreign   currency exchange gains (losses), net; and unrealized gain (loss) on debt   and equity securities, net; and     </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve   changes and settlements that may reduce cash available to us.   </li></ul><p class=\"\">Constant Currency</p><p class=\"\">We compare the percent change in our current period results from the corresponding prior period using constant currency disclosure. We present constant currency growth rate information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying revenue performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We calculate constant currency by translating our current period financial results using the corresponding prior period's monthly exchange rates for our transacted currencies other than the U.S. dollar.</p><p class=\"\">Free Cash Flow</p><p class=\"\">We define free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures.</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Costs and Operating Expenses</p><p class=\"\">Costs and operating expenses are defined as: cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization; operations and support; sales and marketing; research and development; and general and administrative expenses. We define Non-GAAP costs and operating expenses as costs and operating expenses excluding: (i) stock-based compensation expense, (ii) certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements, (iii) goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets, (iv) acquisition, financing and divestiture related expenses, (v) restructuring and related charges and (vi) other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance.</p><p class=\"\">Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA</p><p class=\"\">The following table presents reconciliations of
