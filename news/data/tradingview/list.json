The basic weighted average shares outstanding for the three <br/>       months and year ended December 31, 2024 were approximately 655 million <br/>       and 624 million, respectively, and approximately 572 million and 554 <br/>       million, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2023. <br/> <br/>(2)    The basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the three <br/>       months and year ended December 31, 2024 was approximately 655 million <br/>       and 624 million shares, respectively. Ares Capital's diluted GAAP net <br/>       income per share for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 <br/>       was $0.70 and $2.68, respectively. The weighted average shares <br/>       outstanding for the purpose of calculating the diluted GAAP net income <br/>       per share for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 were <br/>       approximately 593 million shares and 575 million shares, respectively, <br/>       which includes approximately 21 million shares for each period related <br/>       to the assumed conversion of Ares Capital's then outstanding $403 <br/>       million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible notes <br/>       (the \"2024 Convertible Notes\"). <br/> <br/>(3)    Core EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure. Core EPS is the net increase <br/>       (decrease) in stockholders' equity resulting from operations, and <br/>       excludes net realized and unrealized gains and losses, any capital <br/>       gains incentive fee attributable to such net realized and unrealized <br/>       gains and losses and any income taxes related to such net realized <br/>       gains and losses, divided by the basic weighted average shares <br/>       outstanding for the relevant period. GAAP net income (loss) per share <br/>       is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Ares Capital <br/>       believes that Core EPS provides useful information to investors <br/>       regarding financial performance because it is one method Ares Capital <br/>       uses to measure its financial condition and results of operations. The <br/>       presentation of this additional information is not meant to be <br/>       considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial results <br/>       prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP net income, <br/>       the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Core EPS are <br/>       set forth in Schedule 1 hereto. <br/> <br/>(4)    Net income can vary substantially from period to period due to various <br/>       factors, including the level of new investment commitments, the <br/>       recognition of realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation <br/>       and depreciation. As a result, quarterly comparisons of net income may <br/>       not be meaningful. <br/> <br/>(5)    Computed as total principal debt outstanding less available cash <br/>       divided by stockholders' equity.

New investment commitments included 26 new portfolio companies and 51 existing portfolio companies. As of December 31, 2024, 241 separate private equity sponsors were represented in Ares Capital's portfolio. Of the approximately $3.8 billion in new commitments made during the fourth quarter of 2024, 88% were in first lien senior secured loans, 2% were in subordinated certificates of the Senior Direct Lending Program (the \"SDLP\"), 1% were in senior subordinated loans, 3% were in Ares Capital's subordinated loan investment in IHAM and 6% were in other equity. Of the approximately $3.8 billion in new commitments, 94% were in floating rate debt securities, of which 87% contained interest rate floors and 2% were in the subordinated certificates of the SDLP. The weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities funded during the period at amortized cost was 9.9% and the weighted average yield on total investments funded during the period at amortized cost was 9.2%. Ares Capital may seek to sell all or a portion of these new investment commitments, although there can be no assurance that Ares Capital will be able to do so. Also in the fourth quarter of 2024, Ares Capital funded approximately $441 million related to previously existing unfunded revolving and delayed draw loan commitments.</p><p class=\"\">In the fourth quarter of 2024, Ares Capital exited approximately $2.7 billion of investment commitments, including approximately $458 million of loans sold to IHAM or certain vehicles managed by IHAM. Of the approximately $2.7 billion of exited investment commitments, 49% were first lien senior secured loans, 35% were second lien senior secured loans, 1% were subordinated certificates of the SDLP, 6% were senior subordinated loans, 5% were Ares Capital's subordinated loan investment in IHAM, 3% were preferred equity and 1% were other equity. Of the approximately $2.7 billion of exited investment commitments, 91% were floating rate, 5% were fixed rate, 1% were non-income producing and 3% were on non-accrual.</p><p class=\"\">As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the weighted average grade of the portfolio at fair value was 3.1 and 3.1, respectively, and loans on non-accrual status represented 1.7% of the total investments at amortized cost (or 1.0% at fair value) and 1.3% at amortized cost (or 0.6% at fair value), respectively.

The amendment, among other things, (a) increased the commitments under the Revolving Funding Facility from approximately $1.8 billion to approximately $2.2 billion, (b) extended the end of the reinvestment period from December 29, 2024 to October 8, 2027, (c) extended the stated maturity date from December 29, 2026 to October 8, 2029 and (d) adjusted the interest rate charged on the Revolving Funding Facility from an applicable Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% or a \"base rate\" plus an applicable spread of 1.90% per annum to an applicable SOFR or a \"base rate\" (as defined in the documents governing the Revolving Funding Facility) plus an applicable spread of 2.00% per annum and with no credit spread adjustment. The other terms of the Revolving Funding Facility remained materially unchanged.</p><p class=\"\">In November 2024, Ares Capital, through its wholly-owned, consolidated subsidiary, Ares Direct Lending CLO 4 LLC (\"ADL CLO 4\"), completed a $544 million term debt securitization (the \"ADL CLO 4 Debt Securitization\"). The ADL CLO 4 Debt Securitization is also known as a collateralized loan obligation and is an on-balance sheet financing incurred by Ares Capital, which is consolidated by Ares Capital for financial reporting purposes and subject to its overall asset coverage requirement. The loans incurred by the ADL CLO 4 Debt Securitization that mature on October 24, 2036 (collectively, the \"October 2036 CLO Secured Loans\") include (i) $464 million of Class A Senior Loans (the \"October 2036 Class A CLO Loans\") and (ii) $80 million of Class B Senior Loans (the \"October 2036 Class B CLO Loans\"). In addition, in connection with the ADL CLO 4 Debt Securitization, ADL CLO 4 issued approximately $260 million of subordinated notes (the \"October 2036 CLO Subordinated Notes\"). Ares Capital retained all of the October 2036 CLO Subordinated Notes, as such, the October 2036 CLO Subordinated Notes are eliminated in consolidation. The October 2036 Class A CLO Loans and the October 2036 Class B CLO Loans may be converted by the lender into notes issued by ADL CLO 4 and bearing the same economic terms, subject to certain conditions under the documents governing the October 2036 CLO Secured Loans and the indenture governing such notes.</p><p class=\"\">In December 2024, Ares Capital and its consolidated subsidiary, Ares Capital JB Funding LLC (\"ACJB LLC\"), entered into an agreement to amend ACJB LLC's revolving funding facility (the \"SMBC Funding Facility\").

The March 2032 Notes pay interest semi-annually and all principal is due upon maturity. The March 2032 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at Ares Capital's option at a redemption price equal to par plus a \"make whole\" premium, if applicable, as determined pursuant to the indenture governing the March 2032 Notes, and any accrued and unpaid interest. The March 2032 Notes were issued at a discount to the principal amount. In connection with the March 2032 Notes, Ares Capital entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap for a total notional amount of $1.0 billion that matures on March 8, 2032 with an effective date of January 8, 2026. Under the forward-starting interest rate swap, Ares Capital will receive a fixed interest rate of 5.800% and pay a floating interest rate of one-month SOFR plus 1.6995%.</p><p class=\"\">In February 2025, Ares Capital's board of directors authorized an amendment to its existing stock repurchase program to extend the expiration date of the program from February 15, 2025 to February 15, 2026. Under the program, Ares Capital may repurchase up to $1.0 billion in the aggregate of its outstanding common stock in the open market at a price per share that meets certain thresholds below its net asset value per share, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by Ares Capital, in its discretion, based upon the evaluation of economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal and regulatory requirements and other factors.</p><p class=\"\">From January 1, 2025 through January 28, 2025, Ares Capital made new investment commitments of approximately $1.2 billion, of which approximately $864 million were funded. Of the approximately $1.2 billion in new investment commitments, 90% were in first lien senior secured loans, 1% were in second lien senior secured loans, 6% were in preferred equity and 3% were in other equity. Of the approximately $1.2 billion in new investment commitments, 79% were floating rate, 18% were fixed rate and 3% were non-income producing. The weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities funded during the period at amortized cost was 10.1% and the weighted average yield on total investments funded during the period at amortized cost was 9.8%. Ares Capital may seek to sell all or a portion of these new investment commitments, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so.</p><p class=\"\">From January 1, 2025 through January 28, 2025, Ares Capital exited approximately $498 million of investment commitments. Of the approximately $498 million of exited investment commitments, 69% were first lien senior secured loans, 11% were second lien senior secured loans, 11% were subordinated certificates of the SDLP, 7% were senior subordinated loans, 1% were preferred equity and 1% were other equity. Of the approximately $498 million of exited investment commitments, 80% were floating rate, 18% were fixed rate and 2% were non-income producing. The weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities exited or repaid during the period at amortized cost was 10.8% and the weighted average yield on total investments exited or repaid during the period at amortized cost was 10.6%. Of the approximately $498 million of investment commitments exited from January 1, 2025 through January 28, 2025, Ares Capital recognized total net realized gains of approximately $1 million.</p><p class=\"\">In addition, as of January 28, 2025, Ares Capital had an investment backlog of approximately $1.8 billion. Investment backlog includes transactions approved by Ares Capital's investment adviser's investment committee and/or for which a formal mandate, letter of intent or a signed commitment have been issued, and therefore Ares Capital believes are likely to close. The consummation of any of the investments in this backlog depends upon, among other things, one or more of the following: Ares Capital's acceptance of the terms and structure of such investment and the execution and delivery of satisfactory transaction documentation. In addition, Ares Capital may sell all or a portion of these investments and certain of these investments may result in the repayment of existing investments. Ares Capital cannot assure you that it will make any of these investments or that Ares Capital will sell all or any portion of these investments.</p><p class=\"\">WEBCAST / CONFERENCE CALL</p><p class=\"\">Ares Capital will host a webcast/conference call on Wednesday, February 5, 2025 at 12:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) to discuss its quarter and year ended December 31, 2024 financial results.

<br/>(1)    All per share amounts and weighted average shares outstanding are <br/>       basic. The basic weighted average shares outstanding for the three <br/>       months and year ended December 31, 2024 were approximately 655 million <br/>       and 624 million, respectively, and approximately 572 million and 554 <br/>       million, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2023. <br/> <br/>(2)    The basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the three <br/>       months and year ended December 31, 2024 were approximately 655 million <br/>       shares and 624 million shares, respectively. Ares Capital's diluted <br/>       GAAP net income per share for the three months and year ended December <br/>       31, 2023 was $0.70 and $2.68, respectively. The weighted average shares <br/>       outstanding for the purpose of calculating the diluted GAAP net income <br/>       per share for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 were <br/>       approximately 593 million shares and 575 million shares, respectively, <br/>       which includes approximately 21 million shares for each period related <br/>       to the assumed conversion of the then outstanding 2024 Convertible <br/>       Notes. <br/> <br/>(3)    Core EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure. Core EPS is the net increase <br/>       (decrease) in stockholders' equity resulting from operations, and <br/>       excludes net realized and unrealized gains and losses, any capital <br/>       gains incentive fee attributable to such net realized and unrealized <br/>       gains and losses and any income taxes related to such net realized <br/>       gains and losses, divided by the basic weighted average shares <br/>       outstanding for the relevant period. GAAP net income (loss) per share <br/>       is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Ares Capital <br/>       believes that Core EPS provides useful information to investors <br/>       regarding financial performance because it is one method Ares Capital <br/>       uses to measure its financial condition and results of operations. The <br/>       presentation of this additional information is not meant to be <br/>       considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial results <br/>       prepared in accordance with GAAP. <br/> </pre><p class=\"\">View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250205975995/en/</p><p class=\"\">CONTACT:    INVESTOR RELATIONS CONTACTS</p><p class=\"\">Ares Capital Corporation</p><p class=\"\">John Stilmar or Carl Drake</p><p class=\"\">(888) 818-5298</p><p class=\"\">irarcc@aresmgmt.com</p></span></div>",
