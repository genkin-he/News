Brent crude is down 1.9% to $74.75 a barrel, while WTI falls 2.1% to $71.21 a barrel. The latest data from the Energy Information Administration show crude stockpiles rose by 8.7 million barrels last week, against expectations of a 1.3-million-barrel rise. Prices are also pressured by concerns that a trade spat between the U.S. and China could hurt global growth and raise inflationary pressures. \"The oil market is now caught between increasing fears that an escalating trade war will damage global oil demand growth...and possible sudden disruption of Iranian oil exports,\" says SEB's chief commodities analyst Bjarne Schieldrop in a note.

Though nominal pay growth is picking up, the gains are uneven, and real cash earnings climbed only 0.6% on year, he says, describing it \"a far more modest gain than the glossy nominal figure.\" The pay bump was also driven significantly by temporary factors, such as bonuses.

Potassium-based fertilizers may take the brunt, as 90% of U.S. consumption of potassium comes from imports. Canada is the leading producer of potash globally, and a tariff could add over $100 per ton for U.S. farmers to the current price tag around $450 a ton, says Farmdoc. Nitrogen fertilizers would also be impacted, although imports account for far less consumption, according to data from the U.S. Geological Survey.

Macquarie highlights that 28% of Nufarm's earnings are from North America, and the company relies heavily on sourcing agricultural chemicals from China to sell into markets including the U.S. Nufarm's costs are likely to rise as the trade war unfolds.

That's the question posed by Morgan Stanley, which concludes any impact would be mostly be felt in metallurgical coal prices. Commodities strategist Helen Amos says China accounts for a relatively small share of U.S. coal exports. Still, U.S. exports of thermal and metallurgical coal to China increased over 2024. Morgan Stanley estimates tariffs would raise costs for around 3.4 million tons of thermal coal, representing less than 1% of traded volumes, and around 10.7 million tons of metallurgical coal, or some 3% of traded volumes. \"We see negligible or only modest potential price impact of China's coal import tariffs, given both coal markets are currently well supplied,\" Morgan Stanley says. \"But we watch for more meaningful shifts in met coal trade flows.\" (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)</p><p class=\"\">1424 ET - Gold jumps to a record high, with the front-month contract rising 0.7% to $2,853.30 a troy ounce.

However, even if the merger goes through, that wouldn't solve the challenges the two companies face. Both carmakers lack compelling EV offerings, and the combined entity would need to build a new EV model pipeline, he says. The two could benefit from larger scale and cost synergy, but that would take time to realize, Sun says.
