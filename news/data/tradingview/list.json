The data showed a 6.7% increase in sales in the electrical category in the three months through December. Analyst Adrian Lemme notes JB Hi-Fi typically grows much faster than this official measure. So, Citi sees material upside to consensus expectations of 5% like-for-like sales growth by JB Hi-Fi in the December quarter. Its own forecasts are for 8.4% growth. \"Harvey Norman also looks well positioned into results given the improvement in the Electrical and Furniture categories,\" Citi says. It expects Australia's central bank to cut interest rates three times this year, starting this month. \"This should further support the consumer recovery we have been forecasting,\" Citi says.

Westgold expects to produce 330,000-350,000 oz of gold in FY 2025, down from a prior projection of 400,000-420,000 oz. It expects to dig up gold at a higher cost, forecasting all-in sustaining costs, or AISC, of A$2,400-A$2,600/oz. \"We also assume the slower ramp-up of Bluebird and Beta Hunt, and softer grades at Big Bell, carry over into FY 2026 and cut production 10% while AISC lifts 4%,\" says Macquarie, referring to Westgold's mines. Still, Macquarie's revised outlook equates to a 32% year-over-year increase in production in FY 2026. It retains an outperform call on Westgold's stock.

Analyst Evan Karatzas says oOh!media needs to show it has reversed, or at least stabilized, the significant market share losses of last year. Until then, UBS says it doesn't have \"comfort oOh!media can deliver an appropriate return on invested capital on what remains a significant level of capex spend (circa 10% of sales).\" UBS highlights that oOh!media's return on invested capital has now fallen below its cost of capital to 9%. UBS downgrades oOh!media to neutral, from buy, and cuts its price target by 32% to A$1.25/share. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)</p><p class=\"\">2352 GMT - The more than 8% drop in Origin Energy's share price that followed a downgrade to annual production guidance for the Australia Pacific LNG project was overdone, contends UBS. The stock reaction ignores several tailwinds that could trigger upgrades to consensus earnings expectations for FY 2026, analyst Tom Allen says. They include a 15%-20% decline in current coal prices, UBS says, noting 45% of Origin's coal costs are unhedged. Origin also wants to expand a battery at the Eraring power station in Australia to become one of the largest battery storage systems in the world. \"We do not believe these incremental earnings (A$100 million per annum from 2H FY 2026) are factored into consensus estimates,\" UBS says.

In a note, analyst Matt Montgomerie thinks the tariff threat shouldn't have a material impact on F&amp;P Healthcare's valuation at this stage because the tariffs may ultimately be reversed or revised. Also, F&amp;P Healthcare can shift production back to New Zealand and use Mexico as a hub for other markets. \"The latter would take time to implement, but over the long term there shouldn't be a material change in F&amp;P Healthcare's gross margin outlook,\" Forsyth Barr says. \"This is confirmed by F&amp;P Healthcare still expecting to reach its 65% target, albeit two to three years later than its original FY 2027/FY 2028 expectations.\" (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)</p><p class=\"\">2201 GMT - Aeris Resources held less cash at the end of 2Q than expected by Ord Minnett, which retains a hold call on the stock as it balances long-term value with a stretched balance sheet. Aeris reported A$26 million in cash at end-December, some A$4 million less than projected by Ord Minnett and despite a lower capital spend. Aeris experienced operational challenges at its Tritton copper mine, with output some 27% below Ord Minnett's forecast and costs around 27% higher. \"The Tritton issues appear to have been somewhat rectified as FY 2025 guidance is unchanged with improved grades/tons set to come from Bugderygar, Avoca Tank and Murrawombie,\" says Ord Minnett, referring to other Aeris-owned pits. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)</p><p class=\"\">2155 GMT - Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare could manufacture more in New Zealand over time as it adjusts to U.S. tariffs on Mexico where it has factories, but such an approach is constrained by staff availability, Jefferies says. F&amp;P Healthcare makes around 45% of its products in Mexico, which President Trump hit with a 25% tariff. \"During the pandemic, F&amp;P Healthcare ran its New Zealand facilities 24/7 but shift patterns are currently 16/5 implying considerable ability to increase capacity,\" analyst Vanessa Thomson says. On staff, F&amp;P Healthcare could benefit from higher unemployment in New Zealand. But this would be partly offset by lower net migration, Jefferies says. \"F&amp;P Healthcare would also need new regulatory approval to sell products manufactured in different facilities which may take some months, especially if there is an increase in applications for approval,\" Jefferies adds. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)</p><p class=\"\">2149 GMT - Packaging company Amcor's newest bull says organic growth is key to unlocking long-term value for shareholders. Jefferies, which raises Amcor to buy from hold, points out that Amcor's volume growth has been anemic since it bought Bemis some years ago. \"We estimate cumulative volumes have declined 5%, or 1% per annum since FY 2019, raising concerns around the outlook for plastic packaging and valuation multiple investors are willing to pay,\" analyst Ramoun Lazar says. Amcor recently agreed to buy Berry, which has a similarly weak track record. Amcor expects deal savings to drive growth in new business areas. \"We are not yet convinced (consensus also skeptical) with Jefferies's long-term volume forecasts circa 0-1% per annum,\" Lazar says.

However, upon further review, it was determined that Cybeats Subco should have been identified as the acquirer, for accounting purposes, under the Acquisition due to its substantive control over the combined entity post-Acquisition. This reevaluation has led to the need for restatement of the Previous 2022 FS to correctly reflect the Acquisition and ensure compliance with applicable accounting standards.</p><p class=\"\">The Acquisition was correctly accounted for in the Previous 2023 FS.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Kimberley Kao</p><p class=\"\">Markets across Asia staged a relief rally after U.S. President Trump agreed to postpone the start of tariffs on Mexico and Canada by a month, suggesting that a reversal is possible.</p><p class=\"\">Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was recently 1.1% higher on Tuesday, led by gains in auto and electronic stocks. Hong Kong's benchmark index rose 2.0% and South Korea's Kospi gained 1.5%.</p><p class=\"\">The rebound came after the U.S. struck last-minute deals with Mexico and Canada to delay new tariffs, after separate calls with the leaders of both nations. China, another tariff target, is also preparing to talk trade with Trump.</p><p class=\"\">Trump's aggressive move to place tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in imports rattled investors, economists and some lawmakers.</p><p class=\"\">In a social media post, Trump said that his administration will see in the next 30 days if an \"economic deal\" with Canada can be structured. He made similar comments about Mexico earlier Monday.</p><p class=\"\">\"A headlines-driven market seems synonymous with Trump 2.0, much like in 2016,\" Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG, said in a note.</p><p class=\"\">The extended timeline for Mexico and Canada can provide immediate relief for risk sentiment, Yeap said. \"More importantly, it underscores President Trump's willingness to negotiate, potentially with tariff moves as bargaining chips rather than firm policy decisions.\"</p><p class=\"\">Oliver Blackbourn, multiasset portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said that the quick reappraisal on tariffs suggests that there might be a way out. It \"gave markets hope that this could be a short-lived episode, although perhaps this is only the case with Mexico and Canada,\" he said in a commentary.</p><p class=\"\">Other Asian stock markets were broadly higher. Taiwan's Taiex index gained 0.7% and Malaysia's benchmark Kuala Lumpur Composite Index rose 0.5%.</p><p class=\"\">Currency markets, which have whipsawed during the barrage of tariff news, breathed a small sigh of relief over the delays.</p><p class=\"\">The yen weakened against most other G-10 and Asian currencies as sentiment toward risk assets rebounded. The Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso clawed back ground lost after the initial jolt. Asian currencies broadly rose against the U.S. dollar.</p><p class=\"\">The offshore yuan strengthened in a possible reflection of expectations that China too will get a tariff reprieve, Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho Securities' head of macro research for Asia, excluding Japan, said in a note. But the \"overarching geo-economic dimensions to U.S.-China trade means that resolution will be far more fraught than is the case with Mexico and Canada,\" he cautioned.</p><p class=\"\">Relief isn't resolution, as Trump has warned that tariff plans are intact, Varathan said. U.S.-driven trade antagonism threats remain at large, and \"it promises to be a bumpy ride for markets in the weeks ahead,\" with currency markets set up to be the most sensitive to U.S. tariff threats, he said.</p><p class=\"\">The euro, Korean won, Thai baht, Malaysian ringgit, Australian dollar and offshore yuan remain on the line, Varathan said.</p><p class=\"\">Until recently, many on Wall Street viewed threats of the U.S. imposing the highest tariffs in decades as a negotiating tactic in border disputes over drug trafficking and migration and unlikely to materialize.</p><p class=\"\">\"We still think that permanent tariffs on the U.S.'s allies (Canada, Mexico) will not be a thing,\" said Thierry Wizman, global foreign-exchange and rates strategist at Macquarie. \"Tariffs [are] likely to be reversed before they do serious damage.\"</p><p class=\"\">\"That's because concessions are an 'easier' way to deal with Trump's 'problems'...and Trump likes to make 'deals,'\" Wizman said in a note.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Fabiana Negrin Ochoa, Ronnie Harui and Farah Elias contributed to this article.</li></ul><p class=\"\">Write to Kimberley Kao at kimberley.kao@wsj.com</p></span></div>",
