The FTSE 100 company said its energy segment's performance remains robust despite warm weather, the analyst adds, noting that the healthcare unit's profit was flat while profit declined in technology. RBC expects a positive topline performance in the short term, along with the disposal of healthcare forecast in the next six months and further delivery of its energy strategy--including acquisitions--, Brooke says. \"Whilst energy standalone is tough to value, the division is cleaner, has positive mix drivers, is higher return and has more favorable working capital dynamics,\" he adds. Shares are down 2.2% at 53.75 pounds. (michael.susin@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
