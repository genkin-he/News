            "title": "Gold Keeps Hitting Record Highs. Here's Why — and Which Stocks Could Benefit. — Barrons.com",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Paul R. La Monica</p><p class=\"\">Worries about tariffs are spooking many investors. But not gold bulls. Fans of the yellow metal are probably relishing all the uncertainty that President Donald Trump's tariff threats are creating.</p><p class=\"\">Gold prices are up about 8.5% already this year. At just under $2,900 an ounce, the yellow metal is at a record high. And that follows a nearly 30% gain for gold in 2024.</p><p class=\"\">Investors in mining stocks are doing even better. The VanEck Gold Miners exchange-traded fund, which has big stakes in Newmont Corp., Agnico Eagle Mines and Barrick Gold, has soared more than 18% so far in 2025.</p><p class=\"\">Should investors be a little wary after such a big run this year on top of 2024's enormous gains? Of course. That would be prudent. But it's worth noting that the mining stocks could have more room to run if gold prices keep climbing. And that seems very plausible.</p><p class=\"\">It appears that both foreign central banks and retail investors are fueling the rally. Poland, Turkey, India, and China have been big buyers, according to data from late last year from the World Gold Council.</p><p class=\"\">\"Emerging market banks are very committed to gold and well positioned to purchase more. Strategically, they will continue to be buyers,\" said Joe Cavatoni, senior markets strategist with the World Gold Council, in an interview with Barron's.</p><p class=\"\">The World Gold Council said in a report Wednesday that demand for gold in the fourth quarter rose to a new quarterly high and that the outlook for 2025 was bright.</p><p class=\"\">\"Central banks and ETF investors [are] likely to drive demand with economic uncertainty supporting gold's role as a risk hedge,\" the WGC said.</p><p class=\"\">It's all about the Trump trade war. The continued surge in gold is a bit unusual since it's happening at a time when the U.S. dollar is also strengthening.</p><p class=\"\">Frank Watson, a markets analyst for Kinesis Money, pointed out that a surging greenback is \"normally a bearish element for dollar-denominated gold prices,\" but he added that \"gold's safe haven appeal remains undiminished amid uncertainty over the economic and inflationary effects of expected US trade tariffs.\" In other words, Trump's trade policies may trump the usual impact a strong dollar has on gold.</p><p class=\"\">Silver prices have been climbing too, rising about 14% so far this year. Alex Ebkarian, chief operating officer of physical precious metals dealer Allegiance Gold, said in an email to Barron's that the prices of both metals should keep climbing due to the market uncertainty.</p><p class=\"\">\"In a high-risk environment, the appeal of physical gold and silver becomes even more pronounced, as they eliminate counterparty risk and provide a reliable store of value,\" he said, adding that a recent move by JPMorgan Chase to deliver about $4 billion worth in gold futures is \"an apparent hedge against potential trade disruptions.\"</p><p class=\"\">So how much higher could gold go? Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for State Street's SPDR Business, thinks gold could top $3,000 an ounce sometime this year due to all that is happening on the worldwide landscape.</p><p class=\"\">\"Geopolitical risks and structural transitions in monetary and fiscal policies should also boost the prospects for gold,\" Arone wrote. \"Central bank purchases throughout the year will likely continue to support gold's price. All that could finally unleash some pent up investment demand from investors chasing last year's record gold prices.\"</p><p class=\"\">That should be good news as well for the mining stocks, which despite their big run already this year, remain reasonably valued. The VanEck Gold Miners ETF is trading for just 12 times 2025 earnings estimates, lower than its 5-year average of 15. It's also trading at about a price-to-earnings ratio that is 45% below the S&amp;P 500, much steeper than its usual 20% discount to the broader market.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Paul R.

Included in EBITDA was a positive plantation fair value price adjustment of US$3 million. A modest recovery in global paper markets was also observed following the extended destocking cycle in 2023.</p><p class=\"\">Looking forward to Sappi's third quarter, Binnie stated: \"While we expect a gradual improvement in paper markets there will be a reduction in output due to a number of planned maintenance shuts in the quarter. We therefore anticipate that EBITDA (excluding a slightly negative fair value price adjustment) for the third quarter of FY2024 will be below that of the second quarter but substantially above last year.\"</p><p class=\"\">Financial summary for the quarter</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">EBITDA excluding special items US$183 million (Q2 FY23 US$167 million)     </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">EPS excluding special items 12 US cents (Q2 FY23 11 US cents)     </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Net debt US$1,366 million (Q2 FY23 US$1,225 million)     </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Closure of Stockstadt and Lanaken Mills completed   </li></ul><p class=\"\">Dissolving pulp (DP) demand was strong throughout the quarter boosted by a tight supply landscape, low downstream inventory levels and high viscose staple fibre (VSF) operating rates following the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations. Sales volumes for the pulp segment increased by 2% year-on-year and hardwood DP spot prices closed the quarter higher at US$940/ton. Profitability for the segment was further supported by significant cost savings, particularly for wood and chemicals.</p><p class=\"\">Packaging and speciality papers demand rebounded during the quarter. Sales volumes improved by 9% compared to the prior year with a mixed performance across the regions. Selling prices came under significant pressure in the second half of FY2023 and were 13% below the prior year. Cost savings were insufficient to offset the negative impact of lower selling prices and profitability for the segment declined compared to last year.</p><p class=\"\">The gradual recovery of graphic papers demand continued throughout the quarter as downstream value chain inventories normalised causing sales volumes to increase by 7% compared to the prior year. However, there has been a structural decline in demand from the highs of 2022. The combination of increased sales volumes and cost savings facilitated a year-on-year improvement in profitability for the segment.</p><p class=\"\">Profitability of the European business continued to recover slowly from the lows of the second half of FY2023. The improvement was driven by increased year-on-year sales volumes and cost savings, offset to some extent by selling price reductions across all product categories. A notable increase in capacity utilisation was achieved due to the successful transfer of Stockstadt and Lanaken sales volumes to our other assets following the termination of production at both mills in the prior quarter. Variable costs were 16% below last year driven by lower purchased pulp and wood costs. However, variable costs increased from the prior quarter on the back of rising pulp prices which were boosted by supply disruptions in Europe due to the Finnish port strikes and mechanical failures at a number of European pulp mills. Fixed costs were 17% below the prior year due to the strategic restructuring of the European business.</p><p class=\"\">The North American business delivered a good performance despite a slower than expected recovery in demand for graphic paper. A strong increase in paperboard sales volumes combined with cost savings offset lower selling prices for packaging. Variable costs were 9% below last year with savings achieved for all major input categories. Fixed costs were 5% above the prior year primarily due to higher personnel costs.</p><p class=\"\">The South African business delivered a solid performance with profitability benefiting from significant cost savings and a ZAR56 million forestry fair value price adjustment. Variable costs were 7% below the prior year due to lower wood, chemical and delivery costs. Fixed costs were well managed with a year-on-year increase of 6%.</p><p class=\"\">Outlook</p><p class=\"\">The third quarter is seasonally the weakest in terms of demand for our products. However, market sentiment is generally improving across all of our product segments and Sappi is well positioned with healthy cash reserves and liquidity to manage current market uncertainties.</p><p class=\"\">Dissolving pulp demand remains healthy, buoyed by low inventory levels across the VSF value chain. VSF pricing has faced downward pressure in recent weeks, which could be a risk for DP pricing in the third quarter. However, the high operating rates through the VSF value chain and relatively constrained DP supply landscape continue to offering some support for DP prices.</p><p class=\"\">Graphic papers demand is expected to continue its slow recovery in the third quarter, but the market fundamentally remains in oversupply and industry operating rates remain below historical levels. Our European restructuring programme has significantly increased our capacity utilisation which, combined with the fixed costs savings, is expected to improve our competitive position. We continue to diligently adapt our product and market mix to match demand in North America ahead of the Somerset PM2 conversion and expansion in 2025. The sale of the Stockstadt Mill site is on track to be concluded in the third quarter.</p><p class=\"\">Packaging and speciality paper markets continue to improve across all regions, and we expect good demand in North America and South Africa. Market conditions in Europe generally remain subdued due to the persistently weak economy and low consumer confidence.</p><p class=\"\">Variable costs have reduced substantially from the peak in 2023 but have plateaued in the second quarter and remain above historical levels for many of our input categories. Globally, pulp market prices have started rising which could negatively impact the profitability of our paper businesses, particularly in Europe where proactive margin management will be required. In the third quarter, the Saiccor and Somerset Mills will take scheduled maintenance shuts, which will have an estimated impact of US$30 million on group profitability.</p><p class=\"\">Capital expenditure for FY2024 is expected to be in the region of US$500 million and as previously communicated includes approximately US$154 million for the Somerset PM2 conversion and expansion project. We remain committed to disciplined capital allocation as we execute our strategy to reduce exposure to graphic paper markets while investing for growth in renewable packaging, dissolving pulp and biomaterials.</p><p class=\"\">The plantation fair value price adjustment for the third quarter is expected to be slightly negative due to higher fuel costs and discount rates.</p><p class=\"\">The full results announcement is available at www.sappi.com.</p><p class=\"\">There will be a conference call to which investors are invited.
