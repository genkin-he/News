Year to date, shares have fallen 3.7%.</p><p class=\"\">The telecommunications company said revenue in Germany fell 7.6% on a reported basis to 3.09 billion euros ($3.20 billion). Service revenue--a closely watched metric in the telecom sector--in the country represents 34% of group service revenue and fell 6.4% to 2.89 billion euros for the quarter ended Dec. 31. This was partly due to the expected impact from German regulatory changes, which prevent landlords from bundling TV services with rental agreements, as well as lower broadband customer base.</p><p class=\"\">Germany's turnaround will take time as the group is still absorbing the impact of the law change and face a highly competitive market environment, Chief Executive Margherita Della Valle said on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"\">Meanwhile, U.K. service revenue climbed 3.3% on organic basis to 1.51 billion euros, boosted by significant investments in customer experience. On a group level, service revenue rose to 7.93 billion euros from 7.505 billion euros.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and after lease expenses increased 2.2% on an organic basis to 2.83 billion euros. This was driven by service revenue growth in most markets and lower energy costs in Europe that offset the law impact in Germany. Revenue rose to 9.81 billion euros from 9.35 million euros.</p><p class=\"\">This represents the first set of earnings following the group's exit from Italy. Vodafone sale of the Italian business to Swisscom was approved by Italy's competition regulator in the quarter, marking the final step for getting full clearance. The proceeds, 8 billion euros in cash, have been used to reduce the group's net debt.</p><p class=\"\">Vodafone expects to complete the merger of its U.K. business with its rival operator Three during the first half of 2025, putting an end to group's reshaping plan for growth, Della Valle said.</p><p class=\"\">Separately, the group launched a share buyback of up to 480 million euros to reduce its share capital.</p><p class=\"\">Vodafone reiterated its fiscal 2025 guidance, which includes adjusted EbitdaaL of around 11.0 billion euros and adjusted free cash flow to be at least 2.4 billion euros.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Najat Kantouar at najat.kantouar@wsj.com</p></span></div>",

That result brings its year-end result excluding Russia and Belarus to 975 million euros, an 8% miss compared with consensus. Year-end profit for the Vienna-based bank including Russia and Belarus came to 1.16 billion euros, better than Citi had anticipated, the analyst says. Citi says that the bank's result excluding Russia and Belarus, given the number of one-offs the bank faced including a provision and the effect of deconsolidating its Belarus business, is largely in line with expectations. Shares trade 1.6% higher at 20.36 euros.

President Trump delayed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports for one month after the countries reached an agreement, though an additional 10% China tariff has proceeded. The broader end point around further U.S. tariff developments remain uncertain, Macquarie analysts say in a note. From the perspective of industrial metals, the implementation of the tariffs for any period of time will be a net bearish development, Macquarie says. The tariffs would drag on global goods demand and industrial production growth, by extension hurting commodities demand. At the same time, they would introduce further headwinds by boosting the U.S. dollar and reducing rate cut prospects, Macquarie adds. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0943 GMT - Singapore's FTSE Straits Times Index edged 0.1% lower to close at 3823.01, bucking the regional trend. China said earlier that it will impose new tariffs on some U.S. imports, responding to President Trump's latest levy on Chinese goods. Beijing's tariff retaliation \"inadvertently ups the ante on an escalatory tit-for-tat trade conflict\" if Trump exercises the clause in his executive order to raise levies in response to retaliation, Vishnu Varathan, head of macro research for Asia ex-Japan at Mizuho Securities (Singapore), says in an email. Among the worst performers on the benchmark index, Venture Corp. fell 3.2%, while Sembcorp Industries and SATS dropped 1.8% each.

The impact on the three parent companies' shares will be limited, and the merger could generate savings of about 110 million euros, they add. When shared among the companies, the analysts estimate that this represents a 15% of 2024 EBIT for Airbus, 1.5% for Thales, and 1.3% for Leonardo. Airbus' shares are down 0.5% at 165.93 euros, Thales' shares are down 0.5% at 156.5 euros, and Leonardo's shares are down 1.1% at 30.24 euros.

The year-end remediation charges stand at 249 million pounds, compared with January's guidance range of 245 million pounds to 255 million pounds, he says. The housebuilder's remediation program is expected to be completed during 2029, addressing any lingering concerns regarding its future legacy fire-related liabilities, and giving greater confidence in its valuation and business case, he says. \"While the guidance midpoint is lower than consensus, we welcome the reiteration of fire safety remediation after an audited review, and the news of a strategy update in March,\" Codling says.

The owner of Nivea skincare products is monitoring the international backdrop as it plans potential measures to \"adapt to new developments\", the spokesperson adds, without disclosing further details. \"The U.S. market remains a strategic growth market for Beiersdorf, which we intend to expand further in the coming years. We have already invested in the U.S. market in recent years and continue to build on this\". Beiersdorf's sales in North America in 2023 represented nearly 13% of its total sales.

Trump's plan to talk with Beijing raised hopes for a U.S.-China tariff reprieve, FSMOne analyst Alwyn Chew Chuan Shyn says. For now, the market doesn't seem too concerned that China announced retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods, he adds. Still, Chew expects volatility in the local market to rise as investors closely monitor the U.S. and Malaysian earnings seasons and Trump's foreign policies. He sees support for the KLCI at 1535 and resistance at 1590. Among gainers, CIMB Group rose 2.4% and Sunway Bhd. climbed 2.3%.

The French bank's quarterly result as well as it CET1 ratio exceeded expectations, the analyst says. The bank's new 2024-2026 net income growth rate target suggests at least a 4% consensus upgrade, Reingen says. The slight fall in the bank's 2025 return on tangible equity to 11.5% from a range of 11.5% to 12% previously, given consensus expectations at 10.4%, should offer relief to investors fearing a steeper downgrade. BNP Paribas' targeted revenue growth of at least 5% per year for 2025-2026 is also higher than investors had expected. BNP shares trade 2.5% higher to 65.94 euros.

BNP Paribas's investment and protection services unit disappointed but the business should benefit later this year from external growth, the analyst says.

(mauro.orru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0853 GMT - Diageo's 1H performance was satisfactory and likely exceeded market expectations, with signs of stabilization as sales were up by 1% and profits down by 1%, Quilter Cheviot's Chris Beckett says. Diageo's decision to remove medium-term guidance of 5%-7% organic sales growth might upset some investors. However, this move is acceptable given that the target was laid during the pandemic--when demand for alcohol was exceptionally high--and unrealistic given the current environment, Beckett writes in a note. Additionally, the owner of Johnnie Walker, Guinness and Smirnoff seems to be effectively managing its significant debt, given that the dividend remained unchanged amid concerns of a potential cut, Beckett says. Diageo's 2H performance is likely to be similar if U.S. tariffs are not imposed, he adds. Shares are down 3.3% and nearly 20% over the last 52 weeks. (michael.susin@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

Exports to the U.S. are less than 2% of gross domestic product, while Trump \"seems in no rush to hit the U.K. with tariffs,\" he says in a note. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's trip to Brussels to discuss security and defence is positive for sterling as it signals intent to repair EU relations, he says.

President Trump delayed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports for one month after the countries reached an agreement, though an additional 10% China tariff has proceeded. The broader end point around further U.S. tariff developments remain uncertain, Macquarie analysts say in a note. From the perspective of industrial metals, the implementation of the tariffs for any period of time will be a net bearish development, Macquarie says. The tariffs would drag on global goods demand and industrial production growth, by extension hurting commodities demand. At the same time, they would introduce further headwinds by boosting the U.S. dollar and reducing rate cut prospects, Macquarie adds. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
