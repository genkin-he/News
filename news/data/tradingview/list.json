That said, untangling how to study for CCIE exams can be an intimidating and complex challenge INE, a global provider of Network training and certification preparation, is releasing a pace-setting guide to achieving the CCIE certification in 40 weeks created by Brian McGahan, INE’s Director of Networking Content and once of the youngest people to ever achieve his CCIE at age 20. </p><p class=\"\">McGahan, CCIE #8593,  has achieved his CCIE certification in Security, Routing &amp; Switching, Service Provider, and Data Center, and has led thousands of students through the rigorous training required to achieve the CCIE certification. “With this pace, you'll need roughly 40 weeks to watch all the videos, get hands-on with the labs, and review everything with quizzes.,” McGahan says. “ It’s a steady and realistic plan, and INE’s CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure Learning Path is designed to help you stay on track and make it happen.”</p><p class=\"\">McGahan recommends splitting INE’s CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure Learning Path over 40 weeks, broken down first based on the technology sections of the CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure Exam topics, followed by deep dives on core topics, then final preparation before sitting the CCIE Lab Exam. McGahan’s recommended approach includes:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Networking Infrastructure (Weeks 1-11):</strong> <ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Topics include LAN Switching, Routing Concepts, EIGPR, OSPF, BGP, IPv6 Routing, and Multicast  </li></ul> </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Software Defined Infrastructure (Weeks 12-16):</strong> <ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Focuses on implementing Cisco SD-Access with DNA Center and Cisco SD-WAN  </li></ul> </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Transport Technologies &amp; Solutions (Weeks 17-19):</strong> <ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Covers MPLS and IPsec with DMVPN  </li></ul> </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Infrastructure Security &amp; Services (Weeks 20-22):</strong> <ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Network Security, QoS, and Network Services  </li></ul> </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Infrastructure Automation &amp; Programmability (Weeks 23-30):   <ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Automation using NETCON/RESTCONF, Python, API calls for SD-WAN &amp; SD-Access, and Telemetry  </li></ul> </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Deep Dives (Weeks 31-35):</strong> <ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Delves Deep into core topics of EIGRP, OSPF, BGP, MPLS, and DMVPN  </li></ul> </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Final Preparation (Weeks 36-40):</strong> <ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Focuses on lab exam review and final lab practice   </li></ul> </li></ul><p class=\"\">“Passing the CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure v1.1 Lab Exam is no small feat,” McGahan says, “but with a clear plan and the right resources, it’s entirely achievable.

Even if all the growth versus the midpoint of guidance came from the client segment, both areas still contributed similarly to the quarter-over-quarter growth in December. They added that it is especially disappointing considering that datacenter revenue in H1 is expected to be similar to H2 2024, contrary to their more optimistic view that server business was improving toward the end of 2024. </p><p class=\"\">\"Our biggest concern has been expectations in artificial intelligence, which clearly have come down closer to our level; consensus numbers for calendar year 2025 are likely to come down to our level, and we are relatively optimistic around traditional servers as well as embedded, but AI visibility likely needs to improve for the stock to find its footing,\" the analysts said. </p><p class=\"\">They added that while there may be a slowdown in the client segment at some point due to the strong 2024, it is clear that Advanced Micro Devices can continue to capture modest market share there. That being said, AI expectations still drive the stock's value, and they believe it's important to remain \"conservative\" for the 2025 calendar year, as the transition from the MI325 to MI350 models is not moving as quickly as Nvidia's shift from the H200 to Blackwell models. </p><p class=\"\">Morgan Stanley adjusted its price target on Advanced Micro Devices to $137 from $147 while keeping its equalweight rating. </p><p class=\"\">Shares fell by nearly 9% in recent trading activity.</p></span></div>",

A total of 886,504 warrants have been issued by the Company in connection with a previous funding arrangement. Therefore, pursuant to the outstanding authority, the Company may issue and further convey up to a maximum of 19,113,496 ordinary shares, which represents approximately 18.3 per cent of all the issued shares and votes in the Company immediately prior to the Placing.</p><p class=\"\">The Placing, arranged by Carnegie and Bryan Garnier, will be conducted in a private placement by way of the Bookbuild, which is an accelerated book-building process in which selected investors may submit bids for the Placing Shares. In the Placing, the Company is primarily targeting long-term institutional and other qualified investors that are capable of offering substantial investments cost-effectively, at attractive terms. The Issue Price is to be determined on the basis of the bids received in the Bookbuild. The Bookbuild is expected to commence immediately following this announcement and is expected to end by 9:00 EET a.m. on 6 February 2025 at the latest. The Bookbuild may be discontinued at any time during the book-building process. Following the close of the Bookbuild, the Board will make the decision to issue the relevant number of new Placing Shares to the Company itself and subsequently convey the Placing Shares to the investors in the Placing, including deciding upon, as applicable, the acceptance of the received bids, the number of Placing Shares to be conveyed and the Issue Price. As soon as practicable after the close of the Bookbuild, receipt of binding commitments from investors and the Board having resolved on carrying out the Placing, an announcement will be made on the final outcome of the Bookbuild and, as applicable, the number of the Placing Shares to be issued to the Company itself and then conveyed to investors, the Issue Price as well as the expected registration date of the Placing Shares.</p><p class=\"\">In connection with the proposed Placing, the Company has entered into a placing agreement with Carnegie and Bryan Garnier (the \"<strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Placing Agreement</strong>\"). Pursuant to the terms of the Placing Agreement, the Joint Bookrunners have agreed to use their reasonable endeavours to procure the subscription of Placing Shares.</p><p class=\"\">The Placing Agreement contain customary warranties and an indemnity from the Company in favour of the Joint Bookrunners. The Placing Agreement also contain provisions which enable the Joint Bookrunners to terminate the Placing Agreement in certain circumstances before the completion of the Bookbuild, the Board's resolution on carrying out the Placing and the settlement of the Placing Shares to investors, including where there has been a material breach of any of the warranties contained in the Placing Agreement or where there is a material adverse change, e.g., in the business or financial affairs of the Company. The Company has agreed to pay the Joint Bookrunners certain commissions and fees in connection with the Placing. Pursuant to the terms of the Placing Agreement, the Joint Bookrunners shall collect payment of the gross Issue Price from the investors in respect of the Placing Shares allocated in the Placing, paying such amounts to the Company on behalf of the investors and organizing the delivery of the Placing Shares to the investors against payment of the Issue Price in full (DVP).</p><p class=\"\"> The Placing is conditional upon, inter alia:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">the Placing Agreement having become unconditional in all respects;</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">the Board resolving to carry out the Placing at the Issue Price and the Company and Joint Bookrunners entering into a separate pricing agreement confirming the Issue Price and the number of the Placing Shares; and</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">the Placing Shares being issued and being registered with the Finnish Trade Register.</li></ul><p class=\"\">Subject to all conditions being met, the Placing Shares are expected to be entered in the Finnish Trade Register approximately on 6 February 2025.</p><p class=\"\">DEVIATION FROM THE PRE-EMPTIVE SUBSCRIPTION RIGHT OF SHAREHOLDERS</p><p class=\"\">As previously announced by the Company on 22 October 2024, in order to enable more flexibility in pursuing the best commercial outcome for the Company and its shareholders, in continued compliance with the financial covenants and to facilitate availability of high-quality Phase II BEXMAB efficacy data, the Company could, subject to market conditions, consider strengthening its financial position before concluding discussions concerning partnering as it believes that the better the Company is financed, the better its position is to conclude a partnership. The Company has been exploring and continues to explore several funding alternatives and has concluded that a promptly executed private placement by way of a book-building process is the most suitable option available to the Company at this time.</p><p class=\"\">The Placing represents a deviation from the shareholders’ pre-emptive subscription right. Prior to resolving to pursue the Placing, the Board has conducted an overall assessment and carefully investigated the alternatives for raising capital, also observing the broader fundraise arranged by the Company in June 2024 enabling shareholder participation. As previously announced, the Company’s current funding provides sufficient working capital into Q2 2025 and the Company’s ability to satisfy its financial covenants until the latter half of March 2025. The Placing, in the form of accelerated book-building, reduces both execution and completion risk as it enables an equity raise efficiently and in a timely manner, typically with a lower discount to the current trading price, less exposure to market volatility, at a lower cost and with significantly reduced completion risk compared to a share issue enabling broader shareholder and investor participation. In the Placing, the Company is primarily targeting long-term institutional and other qualified investors due to their capability of offering substantial investments cost-effectively, at attractive terms. In particular, the rapidness of the Placing is considered as a significant advantage as it would provide the Company with funding prior to the forthcoming topline readout of Phase II BEXMAB trial and, consequently, continued operations and flexibility in pursuing the best commercial outcome in the partnering discussions.

The primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of <em>bexmarilimab</em> in combination with SoC (azacitidine) treatment. Directly targeting Clever-1 could limit the replication capacity of cancer cells, increase antigen presentation, ignite an immune response, and allow current treatments to be more effective. Clever-1 is highly expressed in both AML and MDS and associated with therapy resistance, limited T cell activation and poor outcomes.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About</strong> <em><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">bexmarilimab</strong></em></p><p class=\"\"><em>Bexmarilimab</em> is Faron's wholly owned, investigational immunotherapy designed to overcome resistance to existing treatments and optimize clinical outcomes, by targeting myeloid cell function and igniting the immune system. <em>Bexmarilimab</em> binds to Clever-1, an immunosuppressive receptor found on macrophages leading to tumor growth and metastases (i.e. helps cancer evade the immune system). By targeting the Clever-1 receptor on macrophages, <em>bexmarilimab</em> alters the tumor microenvironment, reprogramming macrophages from an immunosuppressive (M2) state to an immunostimulatory (M1) one, upregulating interferon production and priming the immune system to attack tumors and sensitizing cancer cells to standard of care.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Faron Pharmaceuticals Ltd</strong></p><p class=\"\">Faron (AIM: FARN, First North: FARON) is a global, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, focused on tackling cancers via novel immunotherapies. Its mission is to bring the promise of immunotherapy to a broader population by uncovering novel ways to control and harness the power of the immune system. The Company’s lead asset is <em>bexmarilimab</em>, a novel anti-Clever-1 humanized antibody, with the potential to remove immunosuppression of cancers through reprogramming myeloid cell function. <em>Bexmarilimab</em> is being investigated in Phase I/II clinical trials as a potential therapy for patients with hematological cancers in combination with other standard treatments.

The prospect of tariffs by the Trump administration has added to inflation fears.</p><p class=\"\">But Edwards notes that several factors, including a strong U.S. dollar, may point to lower inflation. “The dollar plays a major role in the ups and downs of import prices and the recent dollar surge is set to send import prices sharply lower,” he said. Excess capacity in China is adding to drops in import prices.</p><p class=\"\">Meanwhile concerns about entrenched supercore services inflation are likely overdone, with labor costs back close to 2% year on year. Shelter inflation, which has kept the core consumer price index stubbornly high, is also set to accelerate its decline.</p><p class=\"\">Edwards further argues that the Fed should not be focused on core CPI at 3.2%, but instead the core PCE deflator, which is rising annually at 2.8%. And market based measures of this core PCE deflator are even lower at 2.4%.</p><p class=\"\">Former Fed Chair Paul Volcker “excoriated the Fed” in Oct. 2018, when he argued that the 2% annual target must have some degree of latitude on either side due to measurement errors, and that from 2010 to 2020 “the Fed’s obsession to drive it back up to 2% caused it to pursue an excessively loose monetary policy.”</p><p class=\"\">“Volcker’s criticism equally applies now, but in the opposite direction,” Edwards said. The Fed should be focusing on the core PCE deflator, and not core CPI. Meanwhile, “measurement errors mean that a stable core PCE between 2-3% is just fine and consistent with price stability.”</p><p class=\"\">Thus, Edwards warns that deflationary forces could overwhelm any inflationary impact from tariffs and surprise market participants.</p><p class=\"\">(Karen Brettell)</p><p class=\"\">     *****</p><p class=\"\">FOR WEDNESDAY'S EARLIER LIVE MARKETS POSTS:</p><p class=\"\">HUMP DAY DATA: ADP, SERVICES PMI, TRADE BALANCE, MORTGAGES - CLICK HERE</p><p class=\"\">MAIN U.S. INDEXES RED, BUT YIELDS TAKE A TUMBLE - CLICK HERE</p><p class=\"\">NASDAQ COMPOSITE: CONFRONTING AN INTERNAL STRUGGLE - CLICK HERE</p><p class=\"\">\"MORE PAY\": UK CONSUMER EYES BOOST - CLICK HERE</p><p class=\"\">FX TRADERS' HORIZONS \"AS SHORT AS THEY'VE EVER BEEN\" - CLICK HERE</p><p class=\"\">GOLD MINERS: MIND THE GAP - CLICK HERE</p><p class=\"\">BIG GAINERS BUT STOXX 600 FLAT - CLICK HERE</p><p class=\"\">EUROPE BEFORE BELL: EARNINGS KEEP YOU BUSY - CLICK HERE</p><p class=\"\">MARKETS CONFOUNDED BY TRUMP'S GAZA PROPOSAL - CLICK HERE</p></span></div>",
