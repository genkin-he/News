            "title": "Why Some Firms Are Turning Operations and Support Staff Into Financial Advisors — Barrons.com",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Anne Field</p><p class=\"\">In 2023, the partners at Frisch Financial decided it was time to hire another financial advisor. The Melville, N.Y., firm, with about $800 million in assets under management, had grown a lot over the preceding 10 years and quite simply needed a fifth person with previous experience who could work with existing clients, bring on board new ones, and become a full-fledged wealth manager.</p><p class=\"\">So the partners were surprised when an unexpected job candidate stepped up: Denise Jackson, who had been with the firm about 20 years, working in a variety of operational, administrative, and customer service jobs. But after the initial surprise, the partners decided the move seemed like a good idea, despite the expected learning curve. \"She knew all the clients. She knew the relationship management software. She knew the operational and service side of things,\" says Shawn Gallagher, a principal at the firm. \"It made sense.\"</p><p class=\"\">There aren't exact numbers for how many support people are becoming advisors, but Jackson appears to represent a trend. \"It's very prevalent right now,\" says Andrew Blake, associate director of wealth management at Cerulli Associates, a financial-services research firm. As the number of advisors set to retire increases and firms struggle to find replacements, tapping support professionals who understand a firm's backbone and inner workings or how things are done at similar enterprises seems like a logical move. If the person is familiar with the company's clients, it can be another plus. \"It's a clear advantage over someone else,\" Blake says.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, moving from operations and support to the financial advisory part of the business isn't a slam dunk. It requires learning a new set of capabilities. \"The job of an advisor is very different from what they were doing before,\" says Gallagher.</p><p class=\"\">Skipping ahead. Previous support experience can help an individual move through the development process faster than they might without that background. Take Jackson. Around the time she expressed interest in filling the new advisor role, the firm had also introduced a four-phase career path for advisors.</p><p class=\"\">The career path starts with financial-planning analysts, who have to learn the firm's software and other basic tasks, and ends with wealth advisors, who are lead advisors, part of the investment committee, and responsible for bringing in business, among other responsibilities. Because of her familiarity with the firm's administrative and other processes, Jackson was able to skip the first phase and go right to the second, associate financial planner. In that role, she sits in on client meetings with a lead advisor, contributing to the discussion when they address such areas as financial planning, as well as doing premeeting prep work, and necessary follow-up. The next step for Jackson, who is currently enrolled in classes to prepare for the Certified Financial Plan exam, is financial planner, which would allow her to assume a role almost like that of a lead advisor.</p><p class=\"\">The power of operational knowledge. For many firms, experience working in operations and other support roles is a definite plus, especially if the individuals already work for the organization. In some cases, practices opt for operations people even when the candidate comes from a different enterprise.</p><p class=\"\">About a year ago, Donald LaGrange and his colleagues at Dallas-based Murphy &amp; Sylvest Wealth Management, wanted to add another advisor to the 10-year-old firm's Elmhurst, Ill., office. \"We generally look for someone who's more proven\" than someone in operations, he says. But then they were introduced through a mutual friend to Scott Long, who was working for an Oakbrook, Ill., retail branch of Fidelity Investments in an operations role. LaGrange figured it would be helpful to have someone who knew the inner workings of a large custodian, \"how to meet all the paper requirements, and was comfortable with that part of the business,\" he says. Long wasn't looking to make a change, but he clicked with the firm's owners, had his Series 7 and 66, and decided to give the advisor role a try.</p><p class=\"\">The Murphy &amp; Sylvest Wealth Management team understood that hiring Long would require a different learning process — one that would combine tried-and-true methods with efforts tailored to his situation. \"We knew we had to commit to Scott's technical development,\" says LaGrange. For starters, that involved Long sitting in on meetings with existing clients in both Elmhurst and Dallas. He still regularly attends meetings with Paul Nolte, senior wealth advisor in the Elmhurst office, and Nolte's clients, doing a postmortem afterward.</p><p class=\"\">Long also turns to different team members for help with their areas of expertise when working with clients. LaGrange, a retired army officer, for example, has met with Long and a few military veteran clients. Long has called on an estate-planning expert when he needed that knowledge. In addition, LaGrange and another advisor usually create the financial plans for Long's clients.</p><p class=\"\">Long works in a hybrid capacity, handling projects like making sure account forms are filled out correctly, for his clients, as well as for Nolte's. His experience is typical of operations professionals transitioning to an advisor role at other enterprises. About one-third of advisors in their first three years at a firm continue to have client service support and operations duties, according to Cerulli's Blake.</p><p class=\"\">Business development options. For some support people, the biggest hurdle to making the transition to advisor tends to be business development. For individuals who just don't succeed or enjoy looking for new clients, the best solution, if available, may be to avoid rainmaker duties, and focus on being a \"service advisor,\" suggests Alex Stickelman, chief compliance officer at Rossby Financial. \"In some firms, they leave lead generation up to the financial advisor,\" she says. \"But at others, there's a servicing advisor who is fully licensed but not responsible for generating business.\"</p><p class=\"\">Ultimately, operations people turned advisors say their previous experience creates an understanding of clients they couldn't have developed otherwise. \"Clients want to know what to expect, what happens next,\" says Long. \"If you've done it all firsthand, you can provide insights into the whole process.\"</p><p class=\"\">Write to advisor.editors@barrons.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The report highlights significant growth in both financial and operational metrics, underscoring the company's robust performance and strategic initiatives.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Financial Highlights</strong></p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Net Sales</strong>: $532.9 million, marking a 24% increase compared to the prior year period, driven by higher volumes and targeted price increases.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Gross Profit</strong>: $199.6 million, reflecting improved margins due to higher net sales and lower net product costs.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Operating Profit</strong>: $115.3 million, a 58% increase from the prior year period, primarily due to higher net sales and lower amortization expenses.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Net Earnings</strong>: $76.9 million, a 75% increase from the prior year period, supported by higher operating profit and stable interest expenses.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Basic Earnings per Common Share</strong>: $0.60, reflecting the increase in net earnings.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Diluted Earnings per Common Share</strong>: $0.59, consistent with the increase in net earnings and reflecting the effect of dilutive securities.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Business Highlights</strong></p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Revenue Segments</strong>: The company reported a 24% increase in net sales, driven by a 26% increase in Premier Protein product sales and a 13% increase in Dymatize product sales. Premier Protein's growth was attributed to a 21% increase in volumes due to distribution gains and promotional activities, while Dymatize saw a 12% increase in volumes, primarily from international markets.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Sales Units</strong>: Premier Protein experienced a significant volume increase of 21%, largely due to distribution gains and promotional activities. Dymatize also saw a 12% increase in volumes, driven by higher international sales.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Market Trends</strong>: Inflationary pressures on protein costs eased during fiscal 2024, but other costs such as packaging and manufacturing faced inflationary pressures. The company anticipates continued inflationary pressures on input costs, including raw materials, packaging, and manufacturing, during fiscal 2025.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Operational Efficiency</strong>: The company achieved a 58% increase in operating profit, primarily due to higher net sales, reduced amortization expenses from the discontinuance of the PowerBar business, and lower net product costs. These gains were partially offset by increased advertising, employee-related expenses, and warehousing and distribution costs.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Future Outlook</strong>: The company expects to generate positive cash flows from operations and believes its cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and potential future credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its future working capital requirements, purchase commitments, and other financing needs. The company is not aware of any trends or uncertainties that could materially impact its liquidity in the foreseeable future.</p><p class=\"\">SEC Filing: <a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1772016/000177201625000028/brbr-20241231.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">BELLRING BRANDS, INC.
