            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Economic data continues to make news in more ways than one. The base year for GDP is being moved from 2011-12 to 2022-23 with improvements in estimations being targeted, including aligning them with the WPI, CPI and the IIP, a frequent source of discord in the past. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is also being revised and base year moved from 2012 to 2024.</p><p class=\"\">The new RBI governor is reportedly reviewing RBI’s internal forecasting tools for inflation and growth so as to minimise projection errors. These include adding a wide spectrum of data sets and the use of machine learning to pre-empt price fluctuations in volatile items such as food. Having taken flak for getting estimates wrong many times, this is understandable.</p><p class=\"\">Underlying data is the real problem</p><p class=\"\">But the larger problem is with actual economic data itself being flaky, not so much forecasting. World Economics, a data analytics firm, has a \"C\" rating assigned to India which means its GDP data should be used with caution.</p><p class=\"\">Questions arising from change in GDP base year</p><p class=\"\">The issues with GDP data are old and well known. Some of them were addressed during the previous base year change in 2011-12. An important change then made was the move from volume to value, with the method of calculating value added itself drastically changed. This became controversial as some indicators improved dramatically. In manufacturing, the change from IIP/ASI data to corporate balance sheets led to value-add growing faster than actual output.</p><p class=\"\">Real GDP as a whole grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7 percent from fiscal 2011-12 to 2022-23, while IIP went up by only 3 percent per annum, raising questions of credibility. In services too, using indirect taxes to measure changes in value resulted in higher growth rates that seemed inexplicable. But old shortcomings persisted.</p><p class=\"\">The IIP, still in use as a high frequency volume series, had less than 20 percent value-based items even though GDP was itself a value-added measure. The IIP also failed to adequately capture the unregistered sector. Further, it did not take into account improvements in capacity or technological changes and its fixed weights (as of 2011-12) meant that it missed newer products such as smartphones.</p><p class=\"\">The other crucial data peg is the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) which has also been problematic. Annual GDP estimates use ASI data instead of IIP, which are used for quarterly estimates. The ASI is a product of the 1960s industrial period and covered only units set up under the Factories Act, which left out a large number of industries outside the Act.</p><p class=\"\">Data for unregistered manufacturing (non-ASI) was collected only once in five years on a sample basis and the IIP was used for extrapolating the benchmark estimates. Also, ASI data came delayed with a lag of 2-3 years which meant that GDP data also got constantly revised.</p><p class=\"\">The famed double-deflator versus the single-deflator issue (which is currently used to deflate nominal data) is another known problem, but this has tended to be downplayed as being an acceptable feature and not a bug.</p><p class=\"\">For at least two important segments of the economy, namely the informal sector and services, primary data availability has been poor, necessitating derivations based on productivity estimations and labour force data. For instance, in many of the service sectors, gross value added (GVA) is derived as the product of estimated labour force and value add per worker, the latter obtained from surveys, some done only once in five years. For the years other than the survey year, estimates were simply extrapolated using appropriate price and quantity (IIP) indices.</p><p class=\"\">With the informal sector more than 70 percent of the economy and services contributing over half of total GDP, a significant chunk of GDP could be said to be “derived” actuals based on estimations from surveys. Clearly firmer data is required for the services and perhaps an Annual Survey of Services, on the lines of the ASI could help.</p><p class=\"\">CPI’s issues are conceptual, not data-related</p><p class=\"\">As regards measuring inflation, the CPI is a critical tool for both monetary policy and for deflating nominal GDP to real terms. But the considerations here are about conceptual issues, such as the treatment of free goods and services, rather than data. The Government seems to be clear about the intended usage of CPI when it says that being a measurement of inflation and an input into monetary policy, the scope of the index should be restricted to monetary transactions only. Here it is worth understanding how inflation tracking works in other economies.</p><p class=\"\">The US tracks retail inflation through two measures viz. the personal consumption Expenditure (PCE) index and the CPI. The PCE reflects changes in the complete prices of goods and services purchased by consumer, not just the out-of-pocket expenses, while the CPI deals with only actual out-of-pocket spends by consumers. In items such as healthcare, this difference can be significant with actual health care costs incurred by the consumer and the economy being different.In essence, the CPI is based on a survey of what households are buying and the PCE on what businesses are selling. This also reflects in the different weights in the two indices. The important difference is in their purpose, one for macro policy, the other about living standards. The US Fed prefers the PCE to gauge inflation at a macro level as it reflects substitution effects better when prices change, while the CPI reflects changes in actual living standards of consumers. The recent debates in India over including food prices in CPI inflation when making monetary policy decisions, comes to mind. Perhaps having two indices could help, though some have argued that the WPI is in some sense similar to the PCE.</p></span></div>",

Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, ticked up to 1.9% from 1.8% in December.

China seems to be carefully targeting energy products which the country has the potential to purchase more of, they say. \"In potential negotiations in the future, reaching a deal where China pledges to buy more oil and gas from the U.S. may be more desirable than China reducing such imports on higher tariffs,\" the economists add.

There's a possibility the 10-year yield will fall into the daily Ichimoku cloud, which is currently between 4.318% and 4.447%, the markets strategist says. Going forward, a break of the 10-year yield below the bottom of the daily Ichimoku cloud might potentially trigger sharp declines, the strategist says. On the other hand, if the 10-year yield rises above 4.690%, this would suggest that the 10-year yield is likely to trade in a range, the strategist adds. Treasury 10-year yield is steady at 4.5167%. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0257 GMT - Stronger-than-expected labor cash earnings growth in Japan and an expansionary services PMI reading continues to support BOJ policy normalization, ING's Min Joo Kang says. Data released earlier showed solid on-year labor cash earnings growth in December, with base earnings rising steadily for a second month, while January's services PMI marked its highest level since September 2024. \"Strong wage growth is likely to lead to consumption growth and keep inflation above 2%,\" the economist says. The market is pricing in another BOJ rate hike in July, but ING forecasts a move in May is possible, especially if this year's Shunto wage talk results are as strong as last year's. ING now sees BOJ's terminal rate at 1.25% versus 1.0% previously, tipping hikes in May and October of 2025, followed by another in 2026.

China's retaliatory tariffs appear much less than proportional compared to the U.S.'s 10% across-the-board additional tariff on $525 billion worth of Chinese goods, they write. However, the combination of retaliatory tariffs with export bans, entity list additions, and antitrust probe into Google, suggests a \"more coordinated and comprehensive approach by [Chinese] policymakers\" than during the 2018-2019 U.S.-China trade war, they say. In the coming days, the U.S.'s reactions to China's retaliation will be among key events to watch, they add. (amanda.lee@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0230 GMT - Unemployment in New Zealand is still rising despite rapid interest-rate cuts since mid-2024, leaving consumers and business owners still searching to see the light of an economic recovery. Mark Smith, senior economist at ASB Bank expects demand for labor will continue to weaken until a modest economic recovery finally shows up in the second half of 2025. Firms will have to carefully manage employee headcount in that time, he adds. With inflation close to the target midpoint and monetary settings still slowing the economy, further swift monetary easing looks appropriate to limit economic and labor market scarring, he adds.

January data point to a solid upturn in business activity across the sector, accompanied by a steeper, solid rise in new business inflows. The survey signaled a sharp jump in average prices charged by service providers, while exports rose for the first time in four months. Firms are upbeat on their prospects over the coming 12 months and have boosted staffing levels, says Usamah Bhatti, economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Services continue to underpin growth in Japan's private sector, contrasting the weakness in manufacturing. Still, companies are confident that private-sector activity will rise over 2025, expecting a rebound in manufacturing output and a broad-based economic recovery, Bhatti says.

Japanese data released earlier showed the economy's real wages rose 0.6% in December from a year earlier, marking a second straight month of increases. A solid rise in Japanese labor cash earnings will reinforce the current market pricing in at least one more rate hike by the BOJ this year, CBA's Joseph Capurso says in a note. In addition, with the 'tariff war' between the U.S. and other countries seemingly ongoing, the AUD/JPY is likely to retest support at 94.69, the head of International and Sustainable Economics adds. USD/JPY falls 0.6% to 153.36; AUD/JPY drops 0.7% to 95.88.

But should the required rate relief not come from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the risk of further ​job losses only grows, she says. The RBNZ's current forecasts suggest the OCR will get to 3.5% this year and no lower until deep in 2027. That will leave monetary conditions too restrictive, Vergara says. RBNZ will need to get the OCR down to 3% this year. Holding out longer will only cause unnecessary and indeed avoidable damage to the labor market, she adds. (james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ)</p><p class=\"\">0144 GMT - There are no signs yet that aggressive interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand since mid-2024 are gaining traction and lifting the economy, says Ben Jarman, chief economist at JP Morgan. To be sure, recent GDP revisions show a more worrying economic trajectory, he adds. The data have yet to turn up meaningfully because policy traction is still being blunted by earlier OCR hikes, he adds. This has slowed the lowering of new mortgage rates, and any improvement in disposable incomes, Jarman says. A number of households will still be rolling their mortgages into higher rates than previous, he adds.

Data released earlier show Japan's real wages rose 0.6% in December from a year earlier, marking a second straight month of increases and adding to the case for another BOJ rate hike. The sharp rise in the BOJ's core CPI inflation forecasts in the January outlook report, together with Gov. Ueda's recent comment that there's \"still a significant distance to the neutral rate of interest,\" has sparked worries over an acceleration of rate hikes and an increase in the terminal rate for this cycle, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities' fixed income strategists say in a recent report. The JGB 10-year yield is 1.5 bps higher at 1.290%. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
