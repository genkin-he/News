It <br/>is not necessarily the case that all financial information in this press <br/>release is equivalent to financial statements of companies in the United <br/>States. It may be difficult to enforce any right or claim arising under U.S. <br/>federal securities laws because the Offeror and Makino Milling Machine Co., <br/>Ltd.

The French oil-and-gas company's other divisions were all broadly in line with expectations, they add. Given TotalEnergies hosted its capital markets day in October, is isn't surprising that it didn't outline any major changes to guidance, the analysts write. TotalEnergies shares rise 1% to 57.56 euros.

The central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged. This means the decision will be a \"non-event\" with the focus on any signals about future policy, ING analyst Frantisek Taborsky says in a note. The policy statement Wednesday and NBP Governor Adam Glapinski's press conference Thursday could both sound hawkish again by indicating rates will remain restrictive, Taborsky says. \"However, it's hard to imagine at this point what more the governor might add to the hawkish message from January.\" The NBP's decision is expected at 1400 GMT.

(kimberley.kao@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0850 GMT - Pandora's results are broadly mixed, with 4Q performance in line with expectations but guidance softer than anticipated, RBC Capital Markets analyst Piral Dadhania says in a note. The Danish jeweler reported revenue of 11.97 billion Danish kroner ($1.67 billion) for the final quarter of 2024, up 11% organically on year. Analysts had forecast revenue of 11.85 billion kroner, according to company-compiled consensus. However, the group's guidance of organic revenue growth between 7% and 8% in 2025 is slightly softer than expected, which could prompt low-single-digit earnings revisions, the analyst says. The company expects the EBIT margin target by 2026 at the lower end of the 26% to 27% range, which will likely be received with some caution, Dadhania says. Shares are down 1.3% at 1,356.50 kroner. (andrea.figueras@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0847 GMT - Novo Nordisk's 2025 outlook is reassuring, says Sheena Berry at Quilter Cheviot. The Danish pharmaceutical company expects a robust 16%-24% sales growth for the year, Berry says. Fourth-quarter sales rose 30%, outpacing expectations, although this was partly driven by insulin rebate adjustments, she notes. The performance of key growth drivers, Ozempic and Wegovy, remains strong, with Ozempic meeting expectations and Wegovy slightly underperforming. Novo Nordisk is set to initiate a new CagriSema Phase 3 trial in 2025 and plans to file with regulators in the first quarter of 2026, a slight delay to ensure a secure supply chain. Shares trade 4.5% higher at 619 Danish kroner. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0845 GMT - DCC's process to sell its healthcare segment, in order to focus on the energy sector, could significantly boost returns to shareholders, Davy Research analyst Colin Grant says. The Irish research firm forecasts that DCC could receive 1.365 billion pounds for the division. This is more than 15 times the FY 2025 Ebitda expectations of 88 million pounds, the analyst adds in a note. Assuming that most of the cash will be returned to shareholders, this means that the disposal will unlock significant value as the deal could be far ahead of DCC's current valuation, Grant adds. DCC said in its third-quarter update that the disposal is progressing in line with expectations, the analyst says. Shares are down 2.4% at 53.65 pounds. (michael.susin@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0838 GMT - Novo Nordisk's initial 2025 outlook is just ahead of Jefferies's expectations. But given a higher starting point and stronger currency effects it suggests up to 6% sales and 10% EBIT consensus upgrades, analysts at the bank write. Novo Nordisk's fourth-quarter sales beat expectations by 5%, mostly on positive U.S. gross-to-net adjustments--the discount offered between the list price and the actual net sales price--for its insulins. Sales of Wegovy were shy of expectations while Ozempic and Rybelsus were in line. A better gross margin, higher research and development costs but less selling and distribution spend helped EBIT beat by 9% and EPS by 6%. The stock will likely tick higher initially but could then fade, Jefferies says. Shares trade 4.2% higher at 617.20 Danish kroner. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0837 GMT - GSK needs to convince investors of a sustainable vaccine outlook after it cut the 2025 sales target of its jabs, Shore Capital analyst Sean Conroy says. The British pharma company now guides for a low single-digit decrease in vaccine sales for this year after a slowdown in the U.S., notably for its RSV shot Arexvy that missed consensus estimates by 18%, the analyst says. \"Some tangible evidence the transient challenges facing Shingrix [shingles vaccine] and Arexvy can be navigated will likely be needed to reinstill the conviction in management's longer-term expectations for these,\" he says in a note. Shares are up 5.7% at 1,458.50 pence. (helena.smolak@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0834 GMT - The cancellation of the \"de minimis\" rule, which allowed low-value shipments to bypass duties and custom scrutiny, as well as the subsequent suspension of Chinese goods shipments by the U.S. Postal Services, should be manageable for PDD Holdings' Temu, says Nomura analyst Jialong Shi tells Dow Jones Newswires. Temu has been preparing for this change in the past year, Shi notes, pointing to the company introducing a half consignment model in early 2024. Under this model, merchants typically ship products to the U.S. in bulk rather than relying on the so-called \"de minimis\" exemption, which was recently revoked by President Trump, Shi notes. While Temu still has significant growth potential in the U.S. market at this stage, uncertainties remain over whether the U.S. government will introduce new regulations to these Chinese companies, he says.

Its earnings were boosted by the stabilization of refining margins, which were particularly low in the prior quarter, he adds. The French oil-and-gas company has navigated a challenging 2024 environment well and its attractive long-term growth profile means it is well-positioned for the future, Carulli adds.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Joseph Pisani and Betsy McKay</p><p class=\"\">Elon Musk, the billionaire adviser to President Trump, has targeted the U.S. Agency for International Development as part of the Trump administration's push to slash federal spending.</p><p class=\"\">In less than two weeks, the administration has moved swiftly to dismantle the work of the 10,000-person, $40 billion foreign assistance agency and the thousands of people who work in nonprofits and other groups that partner with it.</p><p class=\"\">This weekend, Musk's Department of Government Efficiency moved to exert control over the foreign-aid organization, clashing with security officials and ultimately accessing the agency's classified systems. The administration closed USAID's headquarters at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., to workers on Monday, instructing them to work remotely.</p><p class=\"\">Trump said he planned to fold USAID into the State Department by executive order, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Monday that he was the acting director of USAID. The administration removed the agency's website, USAID.gov, and placed it into a subsection of the State Department's website.</p><p class=\"\">Musk suggested on his social-media platform X that he wanted to close down the agency entirely — and USAID's X profile was taken down.</p><p class=\"\">On Tuesday, all of USAID's Washington facilities were closed, as the agency prepared to put nearly all of its remaining 1,400 staffers on administrative leave, two officials said.</p><p class=\"\">The big announcement came later that night: Nearly all USAID staff would be put on paid administrative leave starting Saturday morning, with aides working around the world ordered to come home within 30 days, barring special circumstances.</p><p class=\"\">Here's what to know about USAID:</p><p class=\"\">What is USAID?</p><p class=\"\">USAID provides financial aid to countries around the world — combating human trafficking, battling diseases, feeding people in places with famine and supporting American-allied countries affected by war, such as Ukraine. It also funds equipment, medicine and staffing in countries battling pandemics and disease outbreaks.</p><p class=\"\">The organization gave assistance to about 130 countries in fiscal year 2023. The top 10 recipients were Ukraine, Ethiopia, Jordan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Nigeria, South Sudan and Syria. In Ukraine, for instance, USAID funds farmers and pays to keep heat and electricity running when Russia attacks the country's infrastructure.</p><p class=\"\">USAID buys corn, beans and rice from U.S. farmers to distribute to other countries. USAID said it bought 1.1 million metric tons of food from U.S. farmers and ranchers in 2023.</p><p class=\"\">Can Musk shut down USAID?</p><p class=\"\">Democrats, and some Republicans have said Musk doesn't have the authority to overturn programs and spending priorities decided by Congress.</p><p class=\"\">President John F. Kennedy created the agency in 1961, based on a foreign-assistance law Congress passed that year. For decades, it was part of the State Department. Congress made it an independent agency in 1998.</p><p class=\"\">Dissolving USAID as an independent agency would take another act of Congress, said Matthew Kavanagh, director of the Center for Global Health Policy &amp; Politics at Georgetown University. Article I of the Constitution gives Congress the prerogative to create or abolish agencies, he said.</p><p class=\"\">Rubio said Monday that he would work with Congress to overhaul USAID, and promised to review the agency's activities and operations. He told lawmakers the review may eliminate certain aid programs.</p><p class=\"\">Two Democratic senators, Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, vowed to place holds on the Trump administration's nominees to serve at the State Department unless USAID was back up and running.</p><p class=\"\">Why are Trump and Musk targeting USAID?</p><p class=\"\">Gutting USAID fits into Trump's campaign promise to cut aid to foreign countries.</p><p class=\"\">Republican critics say USAID is wasting taxpayer money on programs that promote liberal causes, such as abortion. USAID has said it is barred from funding abortions by law. It does fund post-abortion care for women to prevent maternal deaths, the agency has said. Rubio said Monday USAID's work has to be aligned with American foreign policy.</p><p class=\"\">Musk called USAID corrupt without providing evidence. \"USAID is a criminal organization,\" he wrote in one post on X. \"Time for it to die.\"</p><p class=\"\">Democrats say USAID saves lives and provides foreign aid quickly in times of crisis. USAID supporters also say the agency is an important tool of diplomacy, separate from foreign policy.</p><p class=\"\">How big is USAID?</p><p class=\"\">The agency had a budget of roughly $44.2 billion in fiscal 2024, or 0.4% of the federal budget, according to USAspending.gov, which tracks government spending data. It has more than 10,000 workers. About two-thirds of them serve overseas, according to the Congressional Research Service.</p><p class=\"\">What would happen if USAID were shut down or significantly diminished?</p><p class=\"\">Large cuts in humanitarian aid could mean people outside the U.S. lose access to vaccines, food and maternal care, said Maryam Deloffre, associate professor of international affairs at George Washington University.</p><p class=\"\">\"I think the potential could be really catastrophic,\" said Deloffre. \"I'm hoping we don't get to that point.\"</p><p class=\"\">Moving the agency under the State Department could threaten its ability to execute its foreign aid mission. \"Suggesting the State Department, which deals in policy, can morph into an effective operational humanitarian and aid agency is absurd,\" Kavanagh from Georgetown said.</p><p class=\"\">This explanatory article may be updated periodically.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Joseph Pisani at joseph.pisani@wsj.com and Betsy McKay at betsy.mckay@wsj.com</p></span></div>",

This spectacular event presents a wonderful opportunity for international collectors and enthusiasts to view five exceptional cars, three of which will be highlights of Broad Arrow’s upcoming inaugural sale as the new official auction house of the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este in May 2025 (held in partnership with BMW AG). Additional exciting cars are available for immediate acquisition via Broad Arrow Private Sales.</p><p class=\"\">“It is a real honour to present these cars at Retromobile in Paris,” says<strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"> Joe Twyman, </strong><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">VP of Sales for the EMEA Region at Broad Arrow</strong>. “Each car is not only highly collectable but represents a significant moment in automotive history and design, worthy of taking its place in any important international collection. That is especially true of the 1948 Ferrari 166 Spyder Corsa set for our inaugural Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este Auction, one of the foundational cars in the legendary marque’s DNA. The Porsche 911 TAG Turbo by Lanzante is also set to attract a great deal of attention. We’ve seen growing interest for these types of truly special custom or reimagined cars over the last year. The TAG Turbo is one of only 11 produced and Broad Arrow Private Sales is extremely proud to present a rare example of this phenomenal car currently available for sale. We are looking forward to fantastic conversations about all the cars on display with collectors and enthusiasts at Retromobile this week.”</p><p class=\"\">Broad Arrow experienced exceptional year-over-year growth of 75 percent in 2024, totaling $316 million in transactions across auctions, private sales, and financing. With showcase events and auctions in 2025, it will continue to offer discerning collectors the opportunity to acquire some of the world’s most desirable collector cars. As one of the only major auction houses offering private sales, auctions and bespoke finance, Broad Arrow’s team of highly respected experts looks forward to discussing buying and selling opportunities with the international crowd of collectors and enthusiasts at Retromobile.</p><p class=\"\">The cars Broad Arrow is proud to present at Retromobile include:</p><p class=\"\">1948 Ferrari 166 Spyder Corsa (Estimate: €5.500.000 - €7.500.000)</p><p class=\"\">The star of the display will be the 1948 Ferrari 166 Spyder Corsa, due to be auctioned for the very first time at Broad Arrow’s Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este Auction on 24-25 May 2025. Chassis number 004 C is widely considered to be one of the most original early Ferrari examples extant. With coachwork by Carrozzeria Ansaloni, the 166 is one of two examples purchased by the Besana brothers, Ferrari’s earliest customers. This extremely rare icon of Ferrari history finished sixth overall at the 1948 Targo Florio and is a veteran of the 1948 and 1949 Mille Miglia, with numerous period Formula Two competitions and hill climbs to its credit.</p><p class=\"\">Complete with Ferrari Classiche White Book certification with its original body, chassis, 2.0-litre V12 engine, and five-speed racing gearbox, it is further complemented by 50-year family ownership from 1965 to 2015 with multiple in-depth editorial pieces documenting its impressive provenance.</p><p class=\"\">1988 Porsche 911 TAG Turbo (Asking Price: £2,200,000)</p><p class=\"\">The Porsche 911 TAG Turbo is one of the greatest stories in the history books of the illustrious Porsche marque. In 1987, Porsche’s research and development department created a one-off 911 that featured a Porsche-designed TAG Turbo 1.5-litre V6 Formula One engine. Used purely to develop the engine for use by McLaren in F1, it was never intended for production, but then in 2018, renowned Porsche specialist, Lanzante, turned this incredible machine into reality.</p><p class=\"\">Only eleven were built, each featuring a genuine F1 engine from the period, and this example has an engine raced by Alain Prost in 1987. This extremely rare car features carbon fibre bodywork, striking Mint Green paintwork, sports seats with blue and green tartan inserts and a top speed of 200mph. The TAG Turbo not only represents the ultimate in analogue performance but is a showcase of exemplary craftsmanship and offers a rare opportunity for the avid Porsche collector, available now via Broad Arrow Private Sales. View a video of the TAG Turbo on track here.</p><p class=\"\">1930 Bentley Speed Six ‘Old No.3’ (Asking Price: Available Upon Request)</p><p class=\"\">Few cars are as revered as the Bentley Speed Six, famous for its exploits in the greatest sports car race in the world, the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Chassis number HM2869 is more affectionately known as ‘Old No.3’ and is one of only two cars built from scratch to race at Le Mans in 1930. ‘Bentley Boys’ Sammy Davis and Tim Birkin were tasked by the company’s founder, W.O. Bentley, with chasing the supercharged Mercedes-Benz in the race, a task they relished as they thundered after the Mercedes, pushing the 200bhp Speed Six to 110mph. It was Woolf Barnato that won the race in his Speed Six, but Old No.3 had made its mark in the history books.</p><p class=\"\">It has continued to be raced since then, most recently competing in the Bentley race at the Le Mans Classic in 2023. Throughout its life, it has been meticulously maintained and presented at numerous concours events around the world, always proving a major talking point among collectors and enthusiasts alike. Old No.3 is more than just a motor car, or even a race car, it is a true piece of history that is as impressive today as it was the day it took the Le Mans circuit back in 1930. Old No. 3 is available now via Broad Arrow Private Sales.</p><p class=\"\">1949 Talbot-Lago T26 Grand Sport Coupe by Dubos Frères <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">(Estimate: €1.200.000 - €1.500.000)</strong></p><p class=\"\">Only 32 short-wheelbase Talbot-Lago Grand Sport Coupe chassis were built and historically each became a significant part of the legacy of founder Anthony Lago. All featured individually coachbuilt bodies, with famous coachbuilder Dubos Frères creating just two. This is the sole survivor and features a 4.5-litre twin-cam engine that contributed to the Grand Sport being the fastest production car in the world for a time.</p><p class=\"\">A Grand Prix winner at the 1949 Concours d’Elegance du Bois de Boulogne in Paris, it was then imported to America where it featured in <em>Road &amp; Track </em>magazine and went on to be owned by the famous driver, Otto Zipper. Owned by a well-known Talbot-Lago collector since 2009, this car featured in the book, <em>Talbot-Lago Grand Sport: The Car from Paris</em> and retains its original matching numbers for chassis, engine, and gearbox. The T26 Grand Sport embodied exclusivity, sophistication and performance at the highest level and returns to Retromobile for the first time since 2005.</p><p class=\"\">1965 Ferrari 275 GTS (Estimate: €1.500.000 - €1.800.000)</p><p class=\"\">Replacing the legendary Ferrari 250 SWB California Spider was no easy task, but Pininfarina did an incredible job to pen the beautiful 275 GTS in 1964. The famous Colombo-designed 60-degree V12 engine featured an increase of 25cc over its predecessor with a vast improvement in torque and usability. This engine had already proved successful in the Ferrari 275 P and 250 LM at Le Mans and its 260hp and superb engineering are equally impressive in the road car.</p><p class=\"\">Only 200 GT Spiders were produced, all beautifully crafted by the Pininfarina design studio to provide a clean and timeless aesthetic that conveys the athletic ability of this highly coveted piece of Ferrari history. Finished in Rosso Rubino Chiaro over Nero Franzi leather, this Classiche certified 275 GTS is a prime example of 1960s Ferrari grand touring Berlinettas and worthy of a place in the world’s finest collections.</p><p class=\"\">While the cars will be the stars, the Broad Arrow Retromobile stand will also feature a number of pieces of highly collectable memorabilia. Visitors will be able to view Formula 1 driver helmets and other desirable items that will be offered in Broad Arrow’s Spring 2025 Memorabilia Online Auction that takes place from 21 April to 4 May. Consignments and bidder registration are already open, and experts will be available to discuss this popular recurring auction with both buyers and sellers.</p><p class=\"\">Further details and images on all lots available on request.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Ends.</strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Editors Notes</strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Photo Credit – </strong>JMK Productions / Courtesy of Broad Arrow</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Broad Arrow </strong>- Broad Arrow, a Hagerty  company, is an advisor, market maker, and financier for car collectors with a commitment to integrity, trust, and innovation.

Private consumption significantly expanded in the first half of 2024, driven by double-digit wage growth.</p><p class=\"\">Meanwhile, inflation steadily declined from 13% in 2022 to 8.6% in 2023, reaching a low of 1.2% in September 2024 due to reduced fuel prices. Inflation is projected to stabilise at around 2.7% in 2025 before easing to 2.4% in 2026, as strong wage pressures and accelerating credit growth persist.</p><p class=\"\">\"However, we expect accession to the Eurozone to be delayed until 2026 at least since inflation is still exceeding the reference value of the ECB (European Central Bank) and the European Commission and also because of continued government instability,\" Allianz Trade said.</p><p class=\"\">Despite recent crises, Bulgaria's public finances will remain stable, reflecting a long-standing commitment to fiscal prudence. Fiscal deficits averaged 2.4% of GDP in 2022-2023 due to stimulus measures mitigating the impact of the war in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"\">Allianz Trade expects a fiscal deficit of around 3% of GDP in 2025-2026 as public investment picks up. Public debt is forecast to rise slightly to 27% of GDP by 2026, which is still a favourable level by EU standards.</p><p class=\"\">Foreign trade activity is expected to stay subdued, with near-balanced current accounts through 2026. The gross external debt-to-GDP ratio, which peaked at 107% in 2009, has since declined to 48% in 2023 and is set to continue its downward trend in the next years.</p> </span></div>",
