However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful comparisons to the corresponding historical or future period, and are used for management incentive compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that are not reflective of the Company's on-going operating performance, such as restructuring and related costs, network transition costs, acquisition and integration costs, impairment of intangible assets, a litigation matter, the loss on extinguishment of debt and the December 2023 Argentina Economic Reform. In addition, these measures help investors to analyze year over year comparability when excluding currency fluctuations as well as other Company initiatives that are not on-going.  We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are an enhancement to assist investors in understanding our business and in performing analysis consistent with financial models developed by research analysts. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in methods and in the items being adjusted.</p><p class=\"\">We provide the following non-GAAP measures and calculations, as well as the corresponding reconciliation to the closest GAAP measure in the following supplemental schedules:</p><p class=\"\">Segment Profit.  This amount represents the operations of our two reportable segments including allocations for shared support functions. General corporate and other expenses, amortization expense, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, other items, net, restructuring and related costs, network transition costs and acquisition and integration costs have all been excluded from segment profit.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings per Common Share (EPS).  These measures exclude the impact of restructuring and related costs, network transition costs, costs related to acquisition and integration, the loss on extinguishment of debt and the December 2023 Argentina Economic Reform.</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Tax Rate. This is the tax rate when excluding the pre-tax impact of restructuring and related costs, network transition costs, costs related to acquisition and integration, the loss on extinguishment of debt, and the December 2023 Argentina Economic Reform, as well as the related tax impact for these items, calculated utilizing the statutory rate for where the impact was incurred.</p><p class=\"\">Organic.  This is the non-GAAP financial measurement of the change in revenue or segment profit that excludes or otherwise adjusts for the change in hyperinflationary markets and impact of currency from the changes in foreign currency exchange rates as defined below:</p><p class=\"\">Change in hyperinflationary markets. The Company is presenting separately all changes in sales and segment profit from our Egypt and Argentina affiliates due to the designation of the economies as highly inflationary as of October 1, 2024 and July 1, 2018, respectively.</p><p class=\"\">Impact of currency. The Company evaluates the operating performance of our Company on a currency neutral basis. The Impact of Currency is the change in foreign currency exchange rates year-over-year on reported results, which is calculated by comparing the value of current year foreign operations at the current period USD exchange rate versus the value of current year foreign operations at the prior period USD exchange rate. The impact of currency also includes (gains)/losses of currency hedging programs, and it excludes hyperinflationary markets.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted Comparisons.  Detail for Adjusted Gross profit, Adjusted Gross margin, adjusted SG&amp;A and adjusted SG&amp;A as percent of Net sales and Adjusted Other items, net are also supplemental non-GAAP measure disclosures. These measures exclude the impact of restructuring and related costs, network transition costs, acquisition and integration costs and the December 2023 Argentina Economic Reform.</p><p class=\"\">EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as Net earnings before Income tax provision, Interest expense, the Loss on extinguishment of debt, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes the impact of the costs related to restructuring, network transition costs, a litigation matter, the December 2023 Argentina Economic Reform, impairment of intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, and share based payments.</p><p class=\"\">Free Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by capital expenditures, net of the proceeds from asset sales.</p><p class=\"\">Net Debt. Net Debt is defined as total Company debt, less Cash and cash equivalents.</p><p class=\"\">Currency-neutral. Currency-neutral excludes the Impact of currency as defined above on key measures. Hyper inflationary markets are excluded from this calculation.</p><p class=\"\">Energizer Holdings, Inc.</p><p class=\"\">Supplemental Schedules - Segment Information</p><p class=\"\">For the Quarter Ended December 31, 2024</p><p class=\"\">(In millions - Unaudited)</p><p class=\"\">Operations for Energizer are managed via two product segments: Batteries &amp; Lights and Auto Care.

We started FY25 with solid performance across our business, led by strong Water and Life Sciences revenue growth within Infrastructure &amp; Advanced Facilities. As we look ahead to the rest of the fiscal year, we continue to see tailwinds from robust bookings over the last several quarters as well as a healthy pipeline across our end markets. We are pleased with our first quarter results and that we've increased our adjusted EPS outlook early in our fiscal year.\"</p><p class=\"\">Jacobs' CFO Venk Nathamuni added, \"We delivered strong first quarter results with gross revenue growth of 4.4% and adjusted net revenue growth of 5.1% year-over-year. While net income margin was negative in Q1 as a result of losses related to the mark-to-market of our ownership stake in Amentum, margin performance on an adjusted EBITDA basis showed material year-over-year improvement. During the quarter, we substantially increased capital returns to our shareholders by repurchasing $202 million of our shares and ended Q1 in a strong financial position. We have started the fiscal year positively and look forward to updating investors and analysts on our long-term strategy at our Investor Day on February 18th.\"</p><p class=\"\">Financial Outlook(3)</p><p class=\"\">The Company reiterates its fiscal 2025 outlook for adjusted net revenue to grow mid-to-high single digits over fiscal 2024, adjusted EBITDA margin to range from 13.8-14.0% and reported free cash flow (FCF) conversion to exceed 100% of net income. We are raising our adjusted EPS range for fiscal 2025 from $5.80-$6.20 to $5.85-$6.20 to reflect our lower share count expectation.</p><p class=\"\">Investor Day 2025</p><p class=\"\">Jacobs will host its Investor Day on February 18, 2025 at 3:00 p.m. EST in Miami, Florida.

included certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These non-GAAP measures are described below.</p><p class=\"\">As a result of the spin-off of the SpinCo Business and merger of the SpinCo Business with Amentum Parent Holdings LLC to form an independent, publicly traded company, Amentum Holdings, Inc.  (the \"Separation Transaction\"), substantially all CMS and C&amp;I (the \"SpinCo Business\") related assets and liabilities were separated on September 27, 2024. As such, the financial results of the SpinCo Business are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented and therefore excluded from the non-GAAP measures described below.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted net revenue is calculated by adjusting revenue from continuing operations to exclude amounts we bill to clients on projects where we are procuring subcontract labor or third-party materials and equipment on behalf of the client (referred to as \"pass throughs\"). These amounts are considered pass throughs because we receive no or only a minimal mark-up associated with the billed amounts. In 2023, we amended our name and convention for revenue, excluding pass-through costs from \"net revenue\" to \"adjusted net revenue.\" This name change is intended to make the non-GAAP nature of this measure more prominent and does not impact measurement. We sometimes refer to our GAAP revenue as \"gross revenue.\"</p><p class=\"\">I&amp;AF and Jacobs adjusted operating profit, adjusted earnings from continuing operations before taxes, adjusted income tax expenses from continuing operations, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted EPS from continuing operations are calculated by:</p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"> <br/>1.

Actions taken by the Company to enhance efficiencies are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period. The Company's management believes the exclusion of the amounts relating to the above-listed items improves the period-to-period comparability and analysis of the underlying financial performance of the business. Adjustments to derive adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted EPS from continuing operations are calculated on an after-tax basis.</p><p class=\"\">Free cash flow (FCF) is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations as reported on the statement of cash flows less additions to property and equipment.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding income tax expense, depreciation expense and interest expense (in each case, to the extent attributable to continuing operations) to, and deducting interest income attributable to continuing operations from, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations.</p><p class=\"\">I&amp;AF Adjusted Operating Margin is a ratio of I&amp;AF adjusted operating profit for the segment to the segment's adjusted net revenue.

For a reconciliation of revenue to adjusted net revenue, see \"Segment Information\".</p><p class=\"\">We believe that the measures listed above are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the Company's operating results and understanding the Company's operating trends by excluding or adding back the effects of the items described above and below, the inclusion or exclusion of which can obscure underlying trends. Additionally, management uses such measures in its own evaluation of the Company's performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods, and believes these measures are useful for investors because they facilitate a comparison of our financial results from period to period.</p><p class=\"\">This press release also contains certain financial and operating metrics which management believes are useful in evaluating the Company's performance. Backlog represents revenue or gross profit, as applicable, we expect to realize for work to be completed by our consolidated subsidiaries and our proportionate share of work to be performed by unconsolidated joint ventures. Gross margin in backlog refers to the ratio of gross profit in backlog to gross revenue in backlog. For more information on how we determine our backlog, see our Backlog Information in our most recent annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Adjusted EBITDA margin refers to a ratio of adjusted EBITDA to adjusted net revenue. Cash conversion refers to a ratio of cash flow from operations to GAAP net earnings from continuing operations. Reported FCF conversion refers to a ratio of FCF to GAAP net earnings from continuing operations. Book-to-bill ratio is an operational measure representing the ratio of change in backlog since the prior reporting period plus reported revenue for the reporting period to the reported revenues for the same period. We regularly monitor these operating metrics to evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, and make strategic decisions.</p><p class=\"\">The Company provides non-GAAP measures to supplement U.S. GAAP measures, as they provide additional insight into the Company's financial results. However, non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures. In addition, other companies may define non-GAAP measures differently, which limits the ability of investors to compare non-GAAP measures of the Company to those used by our peer companies.</p><p class=\"\">The following tables reconcile the components and values of U.S. GAAP earnings from continuing operations before taxes, income taxes from continuing operations, net earnings attributable to Jacobs from continuing operations, Diluted Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Per Share (which we refer to as EPS from continuing operations), to the corresponding \"adjusted\" amount, net cash provided by operating activities to reported free cash flow and revenue to adjusted net revenue. For the comparable period presented below, such adjustments consist of amounts incurred in connection with the items described above.

The company has blamed economic issues in the country for pushing down demand as well as China's anti-bribery and anti-corruption drive that has also hurt sales.

The company sold over $7.8 billion worth of the drug in the quarter, compared with analyst forecasts of around $7.4 billion. </p><p class=\"\">The drugmaker said it earned $4.37 billion, or $1.72 a share, in the quarter, excluding one-time items, compared with $66 million, or 3 cents a share, last year. Analysts had expected the company to earn $1.62 a share in the quarter.</p><p class=\"\">Total revenue in the quarter was $15.6 billion, up from $14.6 billion a year earlier.
