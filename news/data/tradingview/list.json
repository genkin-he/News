            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">OKLAHOMA CITY, Feb.  04, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Comstock Inc. (NYSE: LODE) today announced that its subsidiary, Comstock Fuels Corporation (“Comstock Fuels”), was approved by the Oklahoma State Treasurer’s Office to issue up to $152 million in qualified private activity bonds.</p><p class=\"\">This allocation of up to $152 million in Qualified Private Activity Bonds that can be issued by Comstock Fuels represents a major achievement in Comstock Fuels’ plans for financing and building its first 400,000 barrel per year commercial demonstration facility in a soon-to-be-selected site in Oklahoma.</p><p class=\"\">This overall approval by the Oklahoma State Treasurer’s Office comes under the Oklahoma Private Activity Bond Allocation Act and would consist of allocations from the Oklahoma Economic Development Pool, the Oklahoma Exempt Facilities Pool, and the Oklahoma Carryforward Pool. The Oklahoma Development Finance Authority (“ODFA”) sponsored this bond allocation to support the State’s essential infrastructure projects with Comstock’s first Oklahoma commercial biorefining facility.</p><p class=\"\">“This allocation is a foundational component of our overall capital and financing plans for Comstock Fuels, including funding each of our planned Bioleum™ Refineries in the U.S. with dedicated project financing,” said Chad Michael Black, Director of Business Development at Comstock Fuels. “Oklahoma has taken a leadership role in accelerating advanced domestic energy solutions and the support from the State Treasurer’s Office and the ODFA underscores our strong alignment with Oklahoma for developing, deploying and operating diverse, scalable and essential energy infrastructure for our communities.”</p><p class=\"\">“We are rapidly achieving the critical prerequisites for securing the project financing needed to build our first commercial demonstration facility, with over $150 million of that objective supported by Oklahoma’s tax-efficient, municipal revenue bond allocation, $3 million in direct Oklahoma-based grants, and a growing group of strategic investors,” stated Corrado De Gasperis, Executive Chairman of Comstock and Comstock Fuels. “We’re also close to selecting an investment banking partner to facilitate the bond placement and underwriting. We’re thrilled to receive such strong support from Oklahoma as we integrate feedstock, site infrastructure, and offtake into a whole new standard for domestic energy production.”</p><p class=\"\">Private activity bonds under the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) are described generally as any bond: (1) of which more than 10% of the proceeds is to be used in a trade or business of any person or persons other than a governmental unit or which is to be directly or indirectly repaid, or secured by revenues from a private trade or business; and (2) in which an amount exceeding the lesser of 5% or $5 million of the proceeds is to be used for loans to any person or persons other than a governmental unit.</p><p class=\"\">The Federal Tax Reform Act of 1986 established limits on the volume of private activity bonds that may be issued in a state during any calendar year. To ensure compliance with federal law, the Oklahoma legislature passed the Oklahoma Private Activity Bond Allocation Act.</p><p class=\"\">Most private activity bonds must be sold on a taxable basis. However, the Code grants exceptions when certain bonds can be sold on a tax-exempt basis (“Qualified Private Activity Bonds”). Such bonds, with certain exceptions, are subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. The Code also imposes a limitation on the amount of Qualified Private Activity Bonds which may be issued by a state in any calendar year.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Comstock Fuels Corporation </strong></p><p class=\"\">Comstock Fuels Corporation (“Comstock Fuels”) delivers advanced lignocellulosic biomass refining solutions that set industry benchmarks for production of cellulosic ethanol, gasoline, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”), and other renewable Bioleum™ fuels, with extremely low carbon intensity scores of 15 and market-leading yields of up to 140 gallons per dry metric ton of feedstock (on a gasoline gallon equivalent basis, or “GGE”), depending on feedstock, site conditions, and other process parameters. Comstock Fuels additionally holds the exclusive rights to intellectual properties developed by Hexas Biomass Inc. (“Hexas”) for production of purpose grown energy crops in liquid fuels applications with proven yields exceeding 25 to 30 dry metric tons per acre per year. The combination of Comstock Fuels’ high yield Bioleum refining platform and Hexas’ high yield energy crops allows for the production of enough feedstock to produce upwards of 100 barrels of fuel per acre per year, effectively transforming marginal agricultural lands with regenerative practices into perpetual “drop-in sedimentary oilfields” with the potential to dramatically boost regional energy security and rural economies.</p><p class=\"\">Comstock Fuels plans to contribute to domestic energy dominance by directly building, owning, and operating a network of Bioleum Refineries in the U.S. to produce about 200 million barrels of renewable fuel per year by 2035, starting with its planned first 400,000 barrel per year commercial demonstration facility in Oklahoma. Comstock Fuels also licenses its advanced feedstock and refining solutions to third parties for additional production in the U.S. and global markets, including several recently announced and other pending projects.

Our proactive and ongoing efforts to align our business structure with the current industry environment have allowed us to deliver our products with reasonable margin erosion. The challenging market conditions will continue at least through the first half of 2025, and we will keep production levels fairly low by design to drive channel inventory down further.

In connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated <br/>      financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2024, we <br/>      had revised prior periods' results to reflect an immaterial correction <br/>      for the accounting treatment related to highly inflationary accounting <br/>      for our unconsolidated affiliate in Türkiye. CNH owns 37.5% of <br/>      TürkTraktör ve Ziraat Makineleri A.S. (TTRAK.IS) and accounts <br/>      for its ownership stake under the equity method. The functional currency <br/>      of Türkiye-based TürkTraktör is the Turkish lira, and the <br/>      Türkiye economy was deemed highly inflationary in 2022. CNH has <br/>      determined that its translation criteria from Turkish lira into CNH's <br/>      functional currency of U.S. dollars resulted in an overstatement of CNH's <br/>      Equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates by $96 <br/>      million in 2023 and by $67 million in the first half of 2024. We have <br/>      revised our GAAP and Non-GAAP results for all prior periods presented <br/>      herein. See the supplemental financial information section below for a <br/>      reconciliation of adjustments to prior reported results. <br/> <br/>   2. c.c. means at constant currency. <br/> <br/>   3. Comparison vs. December 31, 2023. <br/> <br/>   4. This item is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the \"Non-GAAP <br/>      Financial Information\" section of this press release for information <br/>      regarding non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the specific table in the <br/>      \"Other Supplemental Financial Information\" section of this press release <br/>      for the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measure and the <br/>      most comparable GAAP financial measure. <br/> <br/>   5. Certain financial information in this report has been presented by <br/>      geographic area. Our geographical regions are: (a) North America; (b) <br/>      Europe, Middle East and Africa (\"EMEA\"); (c) South America and (d) Asia <br/>      Pacific. The geographic designations have the following meanings: <br/> <br/>          1. North America: United States, Canada, and Mexico; <br/> <br/>          2. Europe, Middle East, and Africa: member countries of the European <br/>             Union, European Free Trade Association, the United Kingdom, <br/>             Ukraine and Balkans, Russia, Türkiye, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, <br/>             the African continent, and the Middle East; <br/> <br/>          3. South America: Central and South America, and the Caribbean <br/>             Islands; and <br/> <br/>          4. Asia Pacific: Continental Asia (including the India subcontinent), <br/>             Indonesia and Oceania. <br/> <br/>   6. Net sales reflecting the exchange rate of 1.04 EUR/USD. <br/> <br/>   7. The Company is unable to provide this reconciliation without unreasonable <br/>      effort due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting the <br/>      occurrence, the financial impact, and the periods in which the <br/>      adjustments may be recognized. For the same reasons, the Company is <br/>      unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable <br/>      information, which could be material to future results. </pre><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Financial Information</p><p class=\"\">CNH monitors its operations through the use of several non-GAAP financial measures. CNH's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful and relevant information regarding its operating results and enhance the readers' ability to assess CNH's financial performance and financial position. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to identify operational trends, as well as make decisions regarding future spending, resource allocations and other operational decisions as they provide additional transparency with respect to our core operations. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning under U.S. GAAP and are unlikely to be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not intended to be substitutes for measures of financial performance and financial position as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.</p><p class=\"\">CNH's non-GAAP financial measures are defined as follows:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBIT of Industrial Activities under U.S. GAAP is defined as net   income (loss) before the following items: Income taxes, Financial   Services' results, Industrial Activities' interest expenses, net, foreign   exchange gains/losses, finance and non-service component of pension and   other post-employment benefit costs, restructuring expenses, and certain   non-recurring items. In particular, non-recurring items are specifically   disclosed items that management considers rare or discrete events that   are infrequent in nature and not reflective of on-going operational   activities.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBIT Margin of Industrial Activities: is computed by dividing   Adjusted EBIT of Industrial Activities by Net Sales of Industrial   Activities.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted Net Income (Loss): is defined as net income (loss), less   restructuring charges and non-recurring items, after tax.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted Diluted EPS: is computed by dividing Adjusted Net Income (loss)   attributable to CNH Industrial N.V. by a weighted-average number of   common shares outstanding during the period that takes into consideration   potential common shares outstanding deriving from the CNH share-based   payment awards, when inclusion is not anti-dilutive. When we provide   guidance for adjusted diluted EPS, we do not provide guidance on an   earnings per share basis because the GAAP measure will include   potentially significant items that have not yet occurred and are   difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted Income Tax (Expense) Benefit: is defined as income taxes less   the tax effect of restructuring expenses and non-recurring items, and   non-recurring tax charges or benefits.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Adjusted ETR): is computed by dividing a)   adjusted income taxes by b) income (loss) before income taxes and equity   in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates, less   restructuring expenses and non-recurring items.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Net Cash (Debt) and Net Cash (Debt) of Industrial Activities: Net Cash   (Debt) is defined as total debt less intersegment notes receivable, cash   and cash equivalents, restricted cash, other current financial assets   (primarily current securities, short-term deposits and investments   towards high-credit rating counterparties) and derivative hedging debt.   CNH provides the reconciliation of Net Cash (Debt) to Total (Debt), which   is the most directly comparable measure included in the consolidated   balance sheets. Due to different sources of cash flows used for the   repayment of the debt between Industrial Activities and Financial   Services (by cash from operations for Industrial Activities and by   collection of financing receivables for Financial Services), management   separately evaluates the cash flow performance of Industrial Activities   using Net Cash (Debt) of Industrial Activities.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Free Cash Flow of Industrial Activities (or Industrial Free Cash Flow):   refers to Industrial Activities only, and is computed as consolidated   cash flow from operating activities less: cash flow from operating   activities of Financial Services; investments of Industrial Activities in   assets sold under operating leases, property, plant and equipment and   intangible assets; change in derivatives hedging debt of Industrial   Activities; as well as other changes and intersegment eliminations.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Change excl. FX or Constant Currency: CNH discusses the fluctuations in   revenues on a constant currency basis by applying the prior year average   exchange rates to current year's revenues expressed in local currency in   order to eliminate the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. </li></ul><p class=\"\">The tables attached to this press release provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.</p><p class=\"\">Forward-looking Statements</p><p class=\"\">All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this press release including competitive strengths; business strategy; future financial position or operating results; budgets; projections with respect to revenue, income, earnings (or loss) per share, capital expenditures, dividends, liquidity, capital structure or other financial items; costs; and plans and objectives of management regarding operations and products, are forward-looking statements.

condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had revised prior periods' results to reflect an immaterial correction for the accounting treatment related to highly inflationary accounting for our unconsolidated affiliate in Türkiye. CNH owns 37.5% of TürkTraktör ve Ziraat Makineleri A.S. (TTRAK.IS) and accounts for its ownership stake under the equity method. The functional currency of Türkiye-based TürkTraktör is the Turkish lira, and the Türkiye economy was deemed highly inflationary in 2022. CNH determined that its translation criteria from Turkish lira into CNH's functional currency of U.S. dollars resulted in an overstatement of CNH's Equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates by $96 million in 2023 and by $67 million in the first half of 2024. Impacts in 2022 were included in the 2023 amount. We have revised our GAAP and Non-GAAP results for all prior periods presented herein.</p><p class=\"\">The prior period impacts to the Company's consolidated statements of operations and the related

The Facilities business   would have experienced growth in the quarter without these account   exits.   Foodservice revenue and Foodservice Organic revenue both   increased 5% compared to the prior year period.     </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">FSS International revenue growth was broad-based across all geographic   regions, largely from ongoing base business growth and net new business   performance--with the U.K., Canada, Chile, and Ireland driving the   increase.

Aramark reported stronger cash flow compared to the prior year period with Net Cash used in operating activities improving approximately $70 million and Free Cash Flow improving approximately $63 million. This performance was led by higher net income and favorable working capital.</p><p class=\"\">At quarter-end, the Company had over $1.7 billion in cash availability.</p><p class=\"\">Aramark commenced repurchasing shares toward the end of the first quarter as part of its $500 million share repurchase program announced in November 2024.

The Company's new business pipeline across the organization remains significant, including in first-time outsourcing. Aramark is confident in its ability to achieve Net New of 4% to 5% of prior year revenue--with retention levels above 95%--in fiscal 2025 and beyond. As a result of the favorable trends in the business, the Company reaffirms its performance expectations for fiscal 2025.</p><p class=\"\">In December 2024, Aramark completed the acquisition of the European-based GPO, Quantum Cost Consultancy Group, further strengthening the Company's position as a leading global professional procurement and supply chain services provider. Quantum has managed spend of $500 million with operations in countries such as Spain, Portugal, Germany, and the Netherlands, serving hotels, restaurants, gaming destinations, and senior and youth residencies.

We believe these financial measures are useful to investors because they enable better comparisons of our historical results and allow our investors to evaluate our performance based on the same metrics that we use to evaluate our performance and trends in our results. These financial metrics are not measurements of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Our presentation of these metrics has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. You should not consider these measures as alternatives to revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share or net cash (used in) provided by operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Revenue (Organic), Foodservice Adjusted Revenue (Organic), Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, Covenant Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow as presented by us may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies because not all companies use identical calculations.</p><p class=\"\">Explanatory Notes to the Non-GAAP Schedules</p><p class=\"\">Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets - adjustments to eliminate amortization expense recognized on acquisition-related intangible assets.</p><p class=\"\">Severance and Other Charges - adjustments to eliminate severance expenses in the applicable period ($6.2 million for the first quarter of 2024).</p><p class=\"\">Spin-off Related Charges - adjustments to eliminate charges related to the Company's prior year spin-off of the Uniform segment, including accounting and legal related expenses, third party advisory costs and other costs.

class=\"\">The Company forecasts that 2025 global industry retail sales will be lower in both the agriculture and construction equipment markets when compared to 2024. In addition, CNH is focused on driving down excess channel inventory primarily by producing fewer units than the retail demand level. Therefore, 2025 net sales will be lower than in 2024.</p><p class=\"\">The lower production and sales levels will negatively impact our segment margin results. However, the Company’s past and ongoing efforts to reduce its operating costs will partially mitigate the margin erosion. CNH is continuing to focus on reducing product costs through lean manufacturing principles and strategic sourcing. The Company will also carefully manage its SG&amp;A and R&amp;D expenses accordingly.</p><p class=\"\">Consequently, the Company is providing the following 2025 outlook:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Agriculture segment net sales(6) down between 13% and 18% year-over-year, including currency translation effects</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Agriculture segment adjusted EBIT margin between 8.5% and 9.5%</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Construction segment net sales(6) down between 5% and 10% year-over-year, including currency translation effects</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Free Cash Flow of Industrial Activities(7) between $200 million and $500 million</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted diluted EPS(7) between $0.65 to $0.75</li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Notes</strong></p><p class=\"\">CNH reports quarterly and annual consolidated financial results under U.S. GAAP and annual consolidated financial results under EU-IFRS.

CNH owns 37.5% of TürkTraktör ve Ziraat Makineleri A.S. (TTRAK.IS) and accounts for its ownership stake under the equity method. The functional currency of Türkiye-based TürkTraktör is the Turkish lira, and the Türkiye economy was deemed highly inflationary in 2022. CNH has determined that its translation criteria from Turkish lira into CNH’s functional currency of U.S. dollars resulted in an overstatement of CNH’s Equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates by $96 million in 2023 and by $67 million in the first half of 2024. We have revised our GAAP and Non-GAAP results for all prior periods presented herein.

CNH’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful and relevant information regarding its operating results and enhance the readers’ ability to assess CNH’s financial performance and financial position. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to identify operational trends, as well as make decisions regarding future spending, resource allocations and other operational decisions as they provide additional transparency with respect to our core operations. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning under U.S. GAAP and are unlikely to be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not intended to be substitutes for measures of financial performance and financial position as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.</p><p class=\"\">CNH’s non-GAAP financial measures are defined as follows:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBIT of Industrial Activities under U.S. GAAP is defined as net income (loss) before the following items: Income taxes, Financial Services’ results, Industrial Activities’ interest expenses, net, foreign exchange gains/losses, finance and non-service component of pension and other post-employment benefit costs, restructuring expenses, and certain non-recurring items. In particular, non-recurring items are specifically disclosed items that management considers rare or discrete events that are infrequent in nature and not reflective of on-going operational activities.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted EBIT Margin of Industrial Activities: is computed by dividing Adjusted EBIT of Industrial Activities by Net Sales of Industrial Activities.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted Net Income (Loss): is defined as net income (loss), less restructuring charges and non-recurring items, after tax.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted Diluted EPS: is computed by dividing Adjusted Net Income (loss) attributable to CNH Industrial N.V. by a weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period that takes into consideration potential common shares outstanding deriving from the CNH share-based payment awards, when inclusion is not anti-dilutive. When we provide guidance for adjusted diluted EPS, we do not provide guidance on an earnings per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted Income Tax (Expense) Benefit: is defined as income taxes less the tax effect of restructuring expenses and non-recurring items, and non-recurring tax charges or benefits.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Adjusted ETR): is computed by dividing a) adjusted income taxes by b) income (loss) before income taxes and equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates, less restructuring expenses and non-recurring items.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Net Cash (Debt) and Net Cash (Debt) of Industrial Activities: Net Cash (Debt) is defined as total debt less intersegment notes receivable, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, other current financial assets (primarily current securities, short-term deposits and investments towards high-credit rating counterparties) and derivative hedging debt. CNH provides the reconciliation of Net Cash (Debt) to Total (Debt), which is the most directly comparable measure included in the consolidated balance sheets. Due to different sources of cash flows used for the repayment of the debt between Industrial Activities and Financial Services (by cash from operations for Industrial Activities and by collection of financing receivables for Financial Services), management separately evaluates the cash flow performance of Industrial Activities using Net Cash (Debt) of Industrial Activities.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Free Cash Flow of Industrial Activities (or Industrial Free Cash Flow): refers to Industrial Activities only, and is computed as consolidated cash flow from operating activities less: cash flow from operating activities of Financial Services; investments of Industrial Activities in assets sold under operating leases, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; change in derivatives hedging debt of Industrial Activities; as well as other changes and intersegment eliminations.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Change excl. FX or Constant Currency: CNH discusses the fluctuations in revenues on a constant currency basis by applying the prior year average exchange rates to current year’s revenues expressed in local currency in order to eliminate the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.</li></ul><p class=\"\">The tables attached to this press release provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Forward-looking Statements</strong></p><p class=\"\">All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this press release including competitive strengths; business strategy; future financial position or operating results; budgets; projections with respect to revenue, income, earnings (or loss) per share, capital expenditures, dividends, liquidity, capital structure or other financial items; costs; and plans and objectives of management regarding operations and products, are forward-looking statements.

Period Financial Statements: </strong>In connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had revised prior periods’ results to reflect an immaterial correction for the accounting treatment related to highly inflationary accounting for our unconsolidated affiliate in Türkiye. CNH owns 37.5% of TürkTraktör ve Ziraat Makineleri A.S. (TTRAK.IS) and accounts for its ownership stake under the equity method. The functional currency of Türkiye-based TürkTraktör is the Turkish lira, and the Türkiye economy was deemed highly inflationary in 2022. CNH determined that its translation criteria from Turkish lira into CNH’s functional currency of U.S. dollars resulted in an overstatement of CNH’s Equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates by $96 million in 2023 and by $67 million in the first half of 2024. Impacts in 2022 were included in the 2023 amount. We have revised our GAAP and Non-GAAP results for all prior periods presented herein.</p><p class=\"\">The prior period impacts to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and the related

consistent with themargins of other significant porphyry deposits in the belt,strengthening our conviction in the project's potential.  Thestep-out drilling at Duck Creek has also significantly expanded thealteration footprint discovered in drill hole DCKDH020, revealing amuch-expanded target area that requires systematic follow-upexploration.”</p><p class=\"\">Trangie Project Drilling

Just as new U.S. tariffs of 10% on China went into effect, Beijing retaliated. European leaders are prepared for their own fight with Trump over the world's most valuable trading relationship — and they prefer cooperation.

Hours earlier, Musk's Department of Government Efficiency sought to exert control over USAID and shut its headquarters to agency officials. Michael R. Gordon, Ken Thomas and Alexander Ward explain where that leaves the agency.</p><p class=\"\">A: It is unclear how Rubio's promise to work with lawmakers to overhaul USAID would be reconciled with Musk's stated determination to close the agency. In his note to lawmakers, Rubio, who says he is now USAID's acting director, said he asked for a review of the agency's activities and that if some of the agency's bureaus were merged into the State Department, the rest might be abolished.</p><p class=\"\">Trump administration officials have been considering plans to merge the 10,000-person, $40 billion agency into the State Department, which would rein in its autonomy. Democratic lawmakers say that would be illegal without congressional approval, as USAID's existence is in federal statute.</p><p class=\"\">Rubio has already ordered a freeze on most foreign aid as part of a review. He later exempted \"core life saving programs\" that involve medicine, medical services, food and shelter. The immediate fate of other programs, which include those that support economic development, counterterrorist training, counternarcotics cooperation and efforts to strengthen the rule of law abroad, was left unclear.</p><p class=\"\">Meanwhile, two Democratic senators, Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, vowed to place holds on Trump's State Department nominees unless the administration's attack on USAID ends.</p><p class=\"\">See The Story</p><p class=\"\">Trump's tariff idol, William McKinley, abandoned his own tariff policy.</p><p class=\"\">Trump often cites the 25th president, William McKinley, as an inspiration.
