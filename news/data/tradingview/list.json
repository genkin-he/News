This has triggered a flight to quality, driving flows into government bonds, though investor jitters have yet to cause a financial shock or credit contraction, the analyst notes. Meanwhile, U.S. tech earnings have been well-received by the market, helping to ease concerns. Even though this AI-driven shock could erode U.S. economic and market strength over time, the impact of Trump's tariffs is likely offsetting what would have otherwise been a weaker USD, the analyst adds. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0250 GMT - Thailand's consumer-price index in January likely rose 1.3% on year, according to the median estimate of seven economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. That would compare with December's 1.23% increase. Inflation may have been driven by several factors, including a low base effect and rising energy prices, says DBS's economics team. Consumer inflation is expected to align with the Bank of Thailand's projections for headline inflation to stabilize around the lower bound of its 1%-3% target range, DBS adds. The data are due Wednesday. (amanda.lee@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0241 GMT - The likelihood of U.S. tariffs on Mexico and Canada is higher despite the delay in the implementation, Nomura analysts say in a research note. Canada and Mexico could \"reach a deal with the U.S. to either avert tariffs or soften the blow by securing conditional exemptions,\" they say. However, the analysts note that Trump previously said there was nothing that targeted countries could do to avoid higher tariffs. \"If these tariffs fully take effect, their size will dwarf the entirety of the tariffs Trump imposed during his first term in office,\" they write, adding, \"higher tariffs are likely to push up core inflation meaningfully, which reinforces our Fed call of no rate cuts this year.\" (sherry.qin@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0234 GMT - Indonesia's inflation may rise post-February as electricity discounts phase out and consumption recovers, CGS International economists Wisnu Trihatmojo and Nazmi Idrus say in a note. However, they anticipate that volatile inflation could stay under control due to a stronger harvest this year, supported by improved weather conditions and increased fertilizer availability. Given the revised VAT hike to only include luxury goods and a softer consumption environment, they lower the year-end inflation forecast to 2.7% from 3.2%. The overall inflation outlook may remain conducive to Bank Indonesia's monetary easing, with expectations for a 5% BI rate by end-2025, down from the current 5.75%, they add. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0227 GMT - Consumer prices in the Philippines likely rose 2.7% on year in January, according to the median forecast of seven economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. That would compare with a 2.9% increase in December. Headline inflation likely cooled due to falling retail prices for rice and easing electricity prices, HSBC's global economics team says in a report. Looking ahead, HSBC expects government efforts to manage rice supply to bring overall inflation down in the next few months. In December, the BSP cut its rates for the third time in 2024 amid low inflation and slowing economic growth. The CPI data are due Wednesday.

Trade uncertainties loom despite the U.S. delaying tariffs on Canada and Mexico, the senior FX strategist says, adding there's potential volatility in markets from President Trump's unpredictability. Meanwhile, Trump has given notice that the European Union was next in line for U.S. tariffs, Wee notes. Also, there was no 30-day reprieve for additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports, with markets awaiting responses from Chinese President Xi, Wee says. The USD Index is 0.3% lower at 108.64. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0155 GMT - The drop in Indonesia's inflation below the central bank's target to the lowest since 2000 is likely to be short-lived, Maybank analysts say. A temporary discount in electricity tariffs was the main factor behind the outsized fall and volatile food inflation may strengthen in the coming months amid rising demand during the Ramadan season, Brian Lee Shun Rong and Chua Hak Bin say. They stick to their call for 2025 headline inflation at 2.6% and 50 bps of rate cuts but note significant uncertainty over whether Bank Indonesia will be able to cut in February, given the need to support the rupiah. The rupiah has weakened 0.8% since BI's January meeting, and U.S. tariff news is buoying the dollar and affecting emerging market currencies, they add.

However, \"we'd caution that trade concerns could start to weigh on markets again if there are no tangible signs of progress on a lasting deal by the end of the month,\" the members add.

With Japan's Finance Ministry auctioning 2.6 trillion yen of 10-year JGBs today, there could be some investor demand, Citi Research's Tomohisa Fujiki says in a research report. However, it appears difficult to build long positions on expectations of price upsides in these circumstances, the rates strategist adds, noting the future of tariffs on Japan is uncertain. The 10-year JGB yield is up 1.5bps at 1.260%.(ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0122 GMT - The postponement of U.S. tariffs on Mexico and Canada on last-minute deals turns focus to the fate of impending tariffs on China, says Vishnu Varathan at Mizuho Securities. Eyes are on potential talks between Trump and Xi that could result in a similar delay, he says. CNH has assumed this deal, pulling back to 7.31 from Monday's highs, but a U.S.-China trade resolution will be far more fraught than with Mexico and Canada, he says. Downside risks in CNH could prove harder to shake. Relief is not resolution, and Trump has warned tariff plans are intact, he adds. Markets are in for a bumpy ride, with currencies the most sensitive to tariff threats. \"EUR, CNH, AUD, KRW, THB and MYR remain on the line,\" he says. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0121 GMT - Bank Indonesia is likely to be cautious in its policymaking, prioritizing end-2025 inflation risks over near-term trends, BofA Securities economists Kai Wei Ang and Rahul Bajoria say in a note. Indonesia's January inflation was sharply below expectations at 0.76% due to an underestimated electricity discount, they say, adding that excluding this factor, inflation would have been 2.2% as underlying pressures rise from food price hikes and rupiah volatility. Given recent currency movements and inflationary pressures, a February rate cut appears unlikely, they reckon. BI may ease policy further in 2Q if the rupiah stabilizes and inflation risks subside, they add. BofA cuts its Indonesia 2025 average inflation forecast to 2.1% from 2.3% but raises its year-end estimate to 2.7% from 2.5%. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0036 GMT - The significant uncertainty around U.S. tariff plans may cause headwinds to Hong Kong's GDP growth, Goldman Sachs economists say. Preliminary figures for the city's 4Q GDP growth came in slightly above consensus expectations, with the GS economists attributing the increase in on-year growth to a smaller drag from private consumption and improved trade balance. \"A stronger starting point would imply a higher 2025 full-year GDP growth,\" they say, but trade uncertainty looms. Taken together, GS raises its 2025 real GDP growth forecast for Hong Kong slightly to 2.2% from 2.0%. Full GDP data is due on Feb. 26 when the next budget is announced.

This has triggered a flight to quality, driving flows into government bonds, though investor jitters have yet to cause a financial shock or credit contraction, the analyst notes. Meanwhile, U.S. tech earnings have been well-received by the market, helping to ease concerns. Even though this AI-driven shock could erode U.S. economic and market strength over time, the impact of Trump's tariffs is likely offsetting what would have otherwise been a weaker USD, the analyst adds.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Wellnex Life  has achieved another breakthrough in its expansion plans with a new market authorisation (MA) for its liquid paracetamol plus caffeine soft gel. The MA comes after Wellnex made a successful submission to Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration for the latest addition to its product range. The company had previously been granted MAs for liquid paracetamol, liquid paracetamol plus ibuprofen and liquid mini-ibuprofen. International interest Managing director Zack Bozinovski said the approval would further drive revenue opportunities for Wellnex Life, with its existing MAs being utilised by domestic and international companies such as Chemist Warehouse and Haleon. The company views the four MAs as a validation of its philosophy of being either ‘first’ or ‘fast’ to market with innovative consumer health products. “The approval of liquid paracetamol plus caffeine soft gel market authorisation is a great testament to the company and its internal capabilities,” Mr Bozinovski said. “This unique product will provide opportunities not only for use in the company’s own brands but also to licence it to third parties.” UK market order Wellnex Life recently continued its global expansion with the delivery of its TGA-registered paracetamol soft gel liquid analgesic to Haleon and the UK market, building on the product’s successful Australian market launch in FY23. The company signed a supply agreement in March 2022 for the soft gel paracetamol to be retailed under Haleon’s pain relief brand in Australia and New Zealand. Wellnex Life also continues to progress its proposed dual listing on the London Stock Exchange, with clear advancement of work streams required to commence the marketing campaign in the UK. Leading UK-based broker SP Angel has been appointed as joint broker to the UK raise, along with Orana, which is being supported by Australian-based Barclay Pearce Capital. Pain Away acquisition On the local front, Wellnex Life has recently acquired leading Australian topical pain relief brand Pain Away. The company believes the acquisition will both complement and accelerate the potential growth of the company’s business operations. “This transformational acquisition gives added impetus to Wellnex Life’s financial growth and scale and reinforces its place as a major and respected participant in the growing healthcare market, both in Australia and overseas,” Mr Bozinovski said.</p></span></div>",
