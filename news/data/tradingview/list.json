            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Katherine Hamilton</p><p class=\"\">Shares of Chinese online retail companies pared back losses after the U.S. Postal Service said it would resume accepting packages from China and Hong Kong--a reversal from its announcement the previous night that it would stop accepting such packages--though the stocks remained down amid continued uncertainty about the effect of tariffs.</p><p class=\"\">Chinese online marketplace Alibaba saw its New York-traded American depositary receipts fall as low as $99.69, a 2.6% drop from market close on Tuesday, but they recovered some of their loss Wednesday morning. New York-traded ADRs of PDD, which owns budget e-retailer Temu, dipped as much as 4.6% to $108.83 after market close, and were still recently down 3%.</p><p class=\"\">The stocks have had a week of ups and downs as the Trump administration's 10% tariffs on Chinese imports threaten to upend their distribution of low-cost products to U.S. customers. The USPS said Wednesday morning it is working with Customs and Border Protection to establish an efficient way to collect the new tariffs while limiting distribution to package delivery.</p><p class=\"\">Some U.S.-based companies that rely on cheap shipping from China also reacted. Amazon's stock fell as much as 2.7% from Tuesday's closing price.</p><p class=\"\">As part of the tariffs, Trump also closed a trade loophole that has helped many Chinese retailers keep prices low for U.S. customers. The loophole, called de minimis, allows exports under $800 to enter the U.S. without duties, and has been crucial savings for e-commerce companies selling cheap clothing, electronics and furniture from China.</p><p class=\"\">Nearly 1.4 billion shipments in 2024 claimed the de minimis exemption, a more-than-sixfold increase from a decade ago, Customs and Border Protection said in January. The cost savings of de minimis has helped companies like Temu offer prices 20% to 40% lower than U.S. competitors and make an estimated $20 billion in 2024, KeyBanc analyst Brad Thomas told The Wall Street Journal.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Katherine Hamilton at katherine.hamilton@wsj.com</p></span></div>",

            "title": "Can You Cancel a Paper Check After It's in the Mail?",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">NEW YORK CITY, NY / ACCESS Newswire / February 5, 2025 / Having second thoughts about a check you recently mailed? Whether you wrote the wrong address on the envelope or made a mistake with the amount, don't panic. Your check may be signed and sealed, but you may still be able to cancel it before it gets delivered.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">How to cancel a paper check</strong></p><p class=\"\">Canceling a paper check that's been mailed is similar to canceling any other paper check. You can't cancel a check that's already been cashed, so you'll need to take action quickly to protect your checking account from unwanted charges.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">1. Gather the relevant information</strong></p><p class=\"\">To attempt to cancel a check, you'll need to have certain details, such as:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\">Check number</p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\">Amount of the check</p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\">Payee's name</p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\">Date on the check</p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\">Your account number</p></li></ul><p class=\"\">Knowing the date you mailed the check and the address on the envelope will also be helpful.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">2. Find out whether the check has cleared</strong></p><p class=\"\">Consider taking a look at your online banking account to find out the status of the check.</p><p class=\"\">You could also call the person or business you mailed the check to and ask whether they've received or cashed it yet.</p><p class=\"\">3. Contact your bank and file a request to stop payment order</p><p class=\"\">A stop payment order is a request to your bank not to process a check. You can only request one for a check that hasn't been cashed. The process to request one may vary between banks. You may need to call the bank or fill out a form to provide written consent.</p><p class=\"\">Depending on your bank, making the request may be free, or you may need to pay a fee. In many cases, this fee may be more affordable than allowing an incorrect or unwanted check transaction to process.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">4. Follow up in writing</strong></p><p class=\"\">Even if your bank does not require a written stop payment order, it can still be beneficial to submit one, because stop payment orders can expire. A verbal request for a stop payment order typically expires within 14 days, while a written one can last for six months.</p><p class=\"\">Although many banks won't cash a check that's more than six months old, your bank may allow you to renew the stop payment order once it expires.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Alternatives to requesting a stop payment order</strong></p><p class=\"\">If you want to avoid the time and cost of requesting a stop payment order from your bank, you might consider reaching out directly to the person or company you sent the check to. Simply explaining the situation and asking them not to cash the check could resolve the situation.</p><p class=\"\">However, this approach can be risky. For example, if your check is lost in the mail, someone else might receive it and attempt to cash it fraudulently. There's also a possibility that the intended recipient will cash your check anyway.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Canceling a check won't cancel your debt</strong></p><p class=\"\">Depending on the purpose of the check, you might still have an outstanding balance after canceling it.</p><p class=\"\">For example, if the check was intended to pay your mortgage, you'll still owe your monthly payment. Similarly, you may still be legally required to pay for goods or services that you've received in exchange for the now-canceled check.</p><p class=\"\">In some situations, being proactive may help you avoid potential late fees or stay in good standing with lenders. If you're not sure whether you owe anything, you can always reach out to the company to explain what happened and find out what you can do to settle your account.</p><p class=\"\">Special considerations for canceling a check that's been lost in the mail</p><p class=\"\">Successfully requesting a stop payment order prevents unintended recipients from cashing a check that's lost in the mail - but it won't stop them from viewing your account and routing number. With this in mind, you may want to take additional steps to protect your financial well-being if your intended recipient never receives your check in the mail.</p><p class=\"\">You might choose to monitor your account more closely than usual so you can identify - and report - any signs of check-related fraud as soon as possible. In the following months, you may also consider monitoring your credit report for suspicious activity.</p><p class=\"\">Disclaimer: Article content is intended for information only.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">NEW YORK CITY, NY /</strong> <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">ACCESS Newswire</strong> <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">/ February 5, 2025 /</strong> Research indicates that while tooth loss in American adults has decreased since the 1970s, it's still a common problem. Around 2.2% of adults between 20 and 64 have no remaining teeth, with older adults facing an increased risk of tooth loss.1 Whether you've lost a tooth to decay, gum disease, or an accident, getting a tooth replacement should be a top priority. Missing teeth don't just spoil your smile; they can also have poor consequences for your oral and bone health. However, thanks to solutions like single dental implants, implant bridges, and implant dentures, patients can get their smiles back. Learn what happens when you don't replace missing teeth here.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Misalignment of Other Teeth</strong></p><p class=\"\">Healthy, properly aligned teeth help support each other. But when one falls out, the surrounding teeth can shift into the gap left behind. A drifting tooth may become loose and wobbly over time. Misaligned teeth can ruin your smile and your bite, making it harder to chew food normally. Replacing a missing tooth as soon as possible helps protect the rest of your teeth and maintains a healthy smile.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Limited Diet</strong></p><p class=\"\">Losing a tooth can make it harder to eat the foods you love. Missing teeth may make eating certain foods painful or tedious. When you're limited to eating what your teeth can easily chew, you may not be able to eat healthy foods and may face nutritional deficiencies. However, certain tooth replacement solutions like dental implants can return your ability to bite and chew effortlessly so you can enjoy a balanced diet.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Bone Loss</strong></p><p class=\"\">Chewing your food provides healthy stimulation to your jaw and helps keep your jawbone healthy. When you lose teeth, your jawbone may shrink and deteriorate due to reduced stimulation. This may reduce bone density in your jaw and affect your facial structure and appearance in the long term. Dental implants function like a tooth root to stimulate the jawbone and prevent bone loss.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Self-Esteem Problems</strong></p><p class=\"\">Tooth loss can be linked to low confidence and low self-esteem. When you're missing a tooth (especially if your tooth gap is easily visible), you may feel embarrassed speaking and smiling. The confidence-boosting power of a healthy smile is undeniable, and in its absence, tooth loss patients may become withdrawn and self-conscious. Tooth replacement is an easy way to regain lost confidence and improve your quality of life.</p><p class=\"\">While the consequences of not replacing a tooth can be severe, the solution is much easier. Dental implants in Colorado Springs are a convenient, durable, and cost-effective solution. Implants look and feel like real teeth, and they bring back not just your smile but your bite force and ability to chew tough foods. If you're missing a tooth or have an extraction planned, talk to your dentist about dental implants and find out if they're the right tooth replacement solution for you.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Source:</strong></p><p class=\"\">1 National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research - Tooth Loss in Adults (Age 20 to 64)</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">CONTACT:</strong></p><p class=\"\">Sonakshi Murze</p><p class=\"\">Manager</p><p class=\"\">sonakshi.murze@iquanti.com</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">SOURCE:</strong> iQuanti</p><p class=\"\">View the original press release on ACCESS Newswire</p></span></div>",

            "title": "Are We Ready for an RV in Retirement? We Decided to Find Out — Journal Report",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Karen Kreider Yoder and Stephen Kreider Yoder</p><p class=\"\">The first few years in retirement are often the most difficult. But they also can set the stage for how you'll fill the years ahead — both financially and psychologically. Stephen Kreider Yoder, 67, a longtime Wall Street Journal editor, joined his wife, Karen Kreider Yoder, 68, in retirement in late 2022. In this monthly  Retirement Rookies  column, they chronicle some of the issues they are dealing with early in retirement .</p><p class=\"\">Karen</p><p class=\"\">We were uneasy when we pulled into our windy coastal campground in December. It was already dark, the kind of timing we try to avoid when bicycle touring. It's harder to pitch the tent at night, unpleasant to cook in the cold and a little creepy to head to the facilities.</p><p class=\"\">But this time, we had only to plug in to the electrical outlet. The lights came on, the heater kicked in and we sat down at the dining table.</p><p class=\"\">For the first time in our married lives, we were traveling in a recreational vehicle. We cracked the window to hear the waves crashing not far off, then closed it to keep out the wind. Steve opened a bottle of wine.</p><p class=\"\">\"I'm beginning to understand,\" I said, and we chuckled sheepishly.</p><p class=\"\">We'd been dismissive of RVs. For decades, we vacationed on the rough side, with backpacks on buses and trains abroad, on our tandem bicycle loaded with camping gear on rides across America.</p><p class=\"\">Could RVers enjoy nature and local color as we did, we asked? How relaxing could it be in those big expensive things?</p><p class=\"\">But in our past few years of bicycle travel we've encountered dozens of retirees in campgrounds who seem pretty happy with their rigs, extolling the joys of a solid roof and stable furnishings.</p><p class=\"\">So we did a test run. We rented a 25-foot RV with a queen-size bed, kitchenette, table for four, shower, propane tank, potable water supply, waste tanks and, importantly, a bathroom. We picked routes we had traveled before, down California's Highway 1 along the Pacific, inland into the Salinas Valley, through the mountains to the Central Valley and back up to the Sacramento River delta.</p><p class=\"\">We soon began to see the light. RV travel may be the ticket, we agreed, especially for our slow-go years down the road when we aren't as agile and grow more fond of creature comforts.</p><p class=\"\">Creature comforts were an obvious draw from our first stop at one of our favorite bike-camping spots, in Half Moon Bay south of San Francisco. We listened to the surf from the comfort of an actual bed with actual sheets, not on a pad on the ground. In the morning, I read my book at the table with a cup of coffee kept hot thanks to the microwave. I cooked breakfast on a three-burner stove that I didn't have to pack away.</p><p class=\"\">And did I mention the clean private bathroom a few steps away?</p><p class=\"\">\"You're never going to want to go back now,\" said the man sitting under an awning next door in the morning, camped there with his wife in their restored 1959 travel trailer. They had been tenters until they retired eight years earlier and switched to the 16-foot camper.</p><p class=\"\">Another retiree walked up and cheerily recounted how he used to rent RVs and finally bought his own. When Steve asked about costs, the man laughed: \"You don't buy an RV to save money.\"</p><p class=\"\">The next revelation came after we unplugged and drove south to Pigeon Point Lighthouse. The sky was blue, the seascape was breathtaking, and we pulled off the road to position the RV with its picture window facing the ocean. Imagine that: We could stop for lunch at the best table in the house, the one with a view of our choosing.</p><p class=\"\">A two-night stay at a KOA campground gave us the opportunity to relax and chat with more retirees in RVs, including a couple who had recently traded tents for a tiny Airstream. We did some grilling and had the energy to hike miles into the coastal hills, things we rarely do after a day's cycling.</p><p class=\"\">Another revelation: Who needs a campground? We'd heard over the years that Walmarts allowed overnight RV parking, but that option wasn't available, judging from phone calls to stores along our route. \"But you can park at the truck stop!\" a friendly Walmart employee offered. Indeed, the cashier at a truck stop along I-5 welcomed us to park along the outer edge. We ate delicious pea soup at the restaurant next door and had a surprisingly good night's sleep to the hum of the semis we were tucked between.</p><p class=\"\">We spent our final night in another of our favorite bike-camping spots, in the Sacramento River delta, where we plugged in and stayed up a little late despite a cold snap, enjoying the electric heater.</p><p class=\"\">We dropped off the rig and spent our trip home on the train talking about where we might go next in an RV.</p><p class=\"\">Steve</p><p class=\"\">The first sounds that our rig emitted took me back a half-century, reminding me of a reason I've always distrusted RVs.</p><p class=\"\">As I drove out of the rental lot, the cabinets creaked, the camper body made odd rumbling sounds and the V-8 roared without accelerating us much. Refueling later revealed 8.5 miles a gallon.</p><p class=\"\">Just as I remembered. My prior relationship with RVs was in the mid-1970s, when I had part-time jobs driving them to dealerships from Elkhart County, Ind., a U.S. RV-manufacturing hub. It was a dream job for a college student, paying me to drive as far as Salisbury, Md., and San Francisco with beds to sleep in.</p><p class=\"\">But these vehicles had issues. A large rig I drove to California had windows that leaked in the rain, cabinets that slammed open and closed while driving and a gas gauge that was wildly optimistic. The fuel pump died in Wyoming.</p><p class=\"\">Some RV owners are still dealing with the same issues 50 years later, judging from the reports I see online. My guilty pleasure last fall was binge-watching YouTube channels featuring RV owners with horror stories of brand-new lemons.</p><p class=\"\">As we pulled out of the lot in our 25-footer, I figured it would be a one-time adventure, something we would do ironically.</p><p class=\"\">The first miles weren't promising. Aside from the noises and elephantine acceleration, the thing was wide. Really wide. As we drove across the Golden Gate Bridge in the right lane admiring the scenery, there was suddenly a \"zing, zing\" noise. Whoah. I later concluded it was the tailpipe, sticking out to the right and scraping against the bridge's steel curb.</p><p class=\"\">But I softened soon after we lumbered into camp after dark. Karen and I kept looking at each other, nodding as we realized we were discovering another joy we hadn't expected. The RV made it simpler to just \"be\" in a place — a campground, a pull-off by the ocean, a highway rest area.</p><p class=\"\">We began discussing the challenges we might face in retirement that would make an RV even more attractive. We could still travel even if one of us were disabled or fell into dementia, or if we simply got tired of rougher travel. And we could camp with friends who didn't cotton to cycling or tents.</p><p class=\"\">One encounter on the road did give us pause. As we drove with the morning sun glinting on the waves to our right down Highway 1 toward Santa Cruz, we passed a cyclist riding our direction laden with touring bags. We pulled over a quarter mile further and waited for him.</p><p class=\"\">He was Paul, a 67-year-old retiree on a bike-camping tour along the coast. We swapped stories about our cycling tours before waving goodbye a bit wistfully as he pedaled away.</p><p class=\"\">\"This is really nice,\" I told Karen, gesturing back from the driver's seat toward our mobile living room. \"But I think I'd still rather be out there.\" She agreed.</p><p class=\"\">The Yoders live in San Francisco. They can be reached at reports@wsj.com.</p></span></div>",
