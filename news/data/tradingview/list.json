Memory-chip maker SK Hynix gains 2.6%. Carmaker Kia is up 1.1%. Meanwhile, LG CNS, an IT service affiliate of LG Group, is down 2.9% on its stock exchange debut.

In a lecture at Pennsylvania's Lafayette College, Jefferson notes strength in household spending, retail sales and activity in the services sector. \"The consumer spending data we have received recently have surprised me to the upside,\" Jefferson said, per his published remarks. On the other hand, some sectors have been notably weak. Residential investment has been flattish over the past three quarters, he notes, and production from the domestic manufacturing sector was about flat last year too. \"Much of the equipment investment that did take place came from imports,\" Jefferson says.

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect the ADP private-sector jobs report tomorrow to show an increase to 150,000 from December's 122,000, while December trade deficit is forecast to widen to $96.8 billion from $78.19 billion. Jobless claims on Thursday are expected to accelerate and Friday's payrolls increases are expected to slow. Analysts show increasing concerns over stickier inflation and weaker growth potentially resulting from trade wars. The 10-year yield loses 0.031 percentage point to 4.511% and the two-year falls 0.051 p.p. to 4.213%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)</p><p class=\"\">1443 ET - The news in the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey wasn't stellar, but it probably won't be enough to get the Fed leaning toward an interest-rate cut in March, economists at Barclays writes in a note. Hiring and job-quit rates both fell throughout 2024, but leveled off somewhat in the final few months of the year. For now, there is \"little in today's data to alter the course of Fed policy,\" the Barclays team says. But they add that with a lower ratio of job openings to unemployed workers, it's becoming more likely that any further decline in labor demand would push up the unemployment rate in the months ahead. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)</p><p class=\"\">1439 ET - Worker remittances to Mexico rose 2.3% in 2024 to a record $64.75 billion, while showing signs of a slowdown, according to data released by the Bank of Mexico. Remittances in December fell 4.9% from the year-earlier month to $5.23 billion. The outlook is patchy for 2025, even without considering possible impact of an anti-immigrant policy under the Trump administration, BBVA's Juan José Li Ng says in a note. BBVA's base case is that remittances will grow 3% this year, \"but with a downward bias given signs of less absorption of Mexican labor in the U.S. over the past year,\" he says. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1434 ET - New research by economists at the St. Louis Fed suggest that wages become more flexible during times of elevated inflation. Studying data over the pandemic and postpandemic period, Maximiliano Dvorkin and Cassie Marks find that during the stretch of high inflation and low unemployment during 2022, wage increases became more likely and larger in scale. Then, they cooled again as the labor market started to normalize in 2023. In 2022, for example, they find that workers had a 55% probability of a positive wage increase, up from 43% in the years before the pandemic. Wage increases fell in likelihood to 53% in 2023, they find. Economists closely study the interconnection between inflation and wages in part to better understand how likely inflation is to become self perpetuating. (matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)</p><p class=\"\">1352 ET - Economists polled in January by the Bank of Mexico lowered their economic growth estimate for this year to 1% from 1.1% in December, while inflation expectations were virtually unchanged at 3.83% and 3.74% for core CPI. GDP slowed to 1.5% in 2024 from 3.3% the previous year, according to statistics institute Inegi. While public security remained the top perceived obstacle to growth, the percentage of analysts citing foreign trade policy rose to 13% from 7% in the previous survey. On Monday, Mexico reached agreement with President Trump to hold off imposing 25% tariffs on Mexican goods for a month while Mexico takes action to curb migration and fentanyl trafficking. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1313 ET - A few days after its quarterly launch, the Atlanta Fed's real-time estimate of 1Q GDP shows the U.S. economy growing at a 3.9% annualized pace over the three months through March. That would be a sharp step up from the 2.3% annualized rate recorded in 4Q 2024 and is well above most Wall Street analysts' forecasts. The model hasn't ingested much 1Q data yet, but recent construction-spending data and ISM manufacturing indexes have pushed the forecast in a positive direction. The first official estimates of 1Q GDP from the Commerce Department are expected to land in late April. (matt.grossman@wsj.com, @mattgrossman)</p><p class=\"\">1154 ET - Economist and market strategist David Rosenberg says he believes Canada and Mexico should have called President Trump's bluff on a 25% tariff. \"That may end up having been a mistake,\" says the head of Rosenberg Research. In a note to clients after the tariff reprieve, Rosenberg says he believes trade uncertainty overhanging Canada and Mexico will dissipate. \"The 30-day reprieve is a joke. Trump is not raising tariffs and probably was never going to,\" Rosenberg says. Canada now avoids a deep recession, Rosenberg says. The Canadian dollar has strengthened, with USDCAD at C$1.4318, or down 3.2% from a Sunday night peak. Still, Rosenberg sticks to his call for USDCAD at C$1.62, with Canada's economy set to underperform the U.S. and require more rate relief. (Paul.Vieira@wsj.com, @paulvieira)</p></span></div>",

In a lecture at Pennsylvania's Lafayette College, Jefferson notes strength in household spending, retail sales and activity in the services sector. \"The consumer spending data we have received recently have surprised me to the upside,\" Jefferson said, per his published remarks. On the other hand, some sectors have been notably weak. Residential investment has been flattish over the past three quarters, he notes, and production from the domestic manufacturing sector was about flat last year too. \"Much of the equipment investment that did take place came from imports,\" Jefferson says.

He has served on the Fed's Board of Governors since May 2022.</p><p class=\"\">The FOMC held its target for the federal-funds rate at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% at its January meeting. It cut rates by a total of a percentage point at its final three meetings of 2024.</p><p class=\"\">\"The U.S. economy is starting the year in a good position,\" Jefferson said. \"I expect inflation's slow descent to continue, and I anticipate that economic growth and labor market conditions will remain solid.\"</p><p class=\"\">Jefferson attributed the continuing economic resilience despite widespread forecasts of a downturn over the past few years to the strength of the American consumer, with spending growth supported by a solid labor market and low unemployment.</p><p class=\"\">\"I see a labor market that is in solid condition and not a source of significant inflationary pressure,\" Jefferson said. \"While the downside risks of a rapidly weakening labor market appear to have lessened, I expect some further softening that could cause the unemployment rate to edge just slightly higher this year but stay in a range consistent with recent readings.\"</p><p class=\"\">After real gross domestic product expanded by 2.8% in 2024, Jefferson expects \"slightly lower\" growth this year.</p><p class=\"\">That said, Jefferson cautioned that 2025 is a year to be humble about economic projections, given the usual dose of uncertainty as well as additional questions about the eventually enacted policies of the new administration in Washington and what their overall economic impact will be.</p><p class=\"\">As for inflation, Jefferson expects a \"bumpy\" path toward the Fed's 2% annual target. He noted that goods inflation has returned to prepandemic levels and non-housing services price growth has cooled alongside the labor market, while housing-price growth remains somewhat elevated.</p><p class=\"\">But he expects more progress in that category in 2025, as more tenants renew their leases.</p><p class=\"\">\"With supply and demand conditions having moved into better balance, wage growth slowing to a more sustainable pace, and longer-term inflation expectations remaining well anchored, I see a path for inflation to continue its progress toward our longer-run goal,\" Jefferson said.</p><p class=\"\">The FOMC's next meeting is on March 18-19, when officials will have two more months of inflation and jobs data to consider.
