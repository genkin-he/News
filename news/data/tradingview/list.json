            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">(14:47 GMT) </strong>*Sappi 2Q Adj EPS 12c<br/><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">(14:47 GMT) </strong>*Sappi 2Q EBITDA Ex-Special Items $183 M<br/><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">(14:48 GMT) </strong>Press Release: Sappi Delivers Results Ahead of Expectations for the Second Financial Quarter</p><p class=\"\">Sappi Delivers Results Ahead of Expectations for the Second Financial Quarter</p><p class=\"\">JOHANNESBURG--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 05, 2025--</p><p class=\"\">Commenting on the group's results, Sappi Chief Executive Officer Steve Binnie said: \"Within the context of subdued underlying market conditions due to the challenging macroeconomic environment I am pleased that the group delivered EBITDA of US$183 million, which was 10% above the prior year.\"</p><p class=\"\">The increase was primarily due to an improvement from the pulp segment and significant costs savings, which included a 9% reduction in cash fixed costs following the closure of the Stockstadt and Lanaken Mills in Europe. Included in EBITDA was a positive plantation fair value price adjustment of US$3 million. A modest recovery in global paper markets was also observed following the extended destocking cycle in 2023.</p><p class=\"\">Looking forward to Sappi's third quarter, Binnie stated: \"While we expect a gradual improvement in paper markets there will be a reduction in output due to a number of planned maintenance shuts in the quarter. We therefore anticipate that EBITDA (excluding a slightly negative fair value price adjustment) for the third quarter of FY2024 will be below that of the second quarter but substantially above last year.\"</p><p class=\"\">Financial summary for the quarter</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">EBITDA excluding special items US$183 million (Q2 FY23 US$167 million)     </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">EPS excluding special items 12 US cents (Q2 FY23 11 US cents)     </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Net debt US$1,366 million (Q2 FY23 US$1,225 million)     </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Closure of Stockstadt and Lanaken Mills completed   </li></ul><p class=\"\">Dissolving pulp (DP) demand was strong throughout the quarter boosted by a tight supply landscape, low downstream inventory levels and high viscose staple fibre (VSF) operating rates following the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations. Sales volumes for the pulp segment increased by 2% year-on-year and hardwood DP spot prices closed the quarter higher at US$940/ton. Profitability for the segment was further supported by significant cost savings, particularly for wood and chemicals.</p><p class=\"\">Packaging and speciality papers demand rebounded during the quarter. Sales volumes improved by 9% compared to the prior year with a mixed performance across the regions. Selling prices came under significant pressure in the second half of FY2023 and were 13% below the prior year. Cost savings were insufficient to offset the negative impact of lower selling prices and profitability for the segment declined compared to last year.</p><p class=\"\">The gradual recovery of graphic papers demand continued throughout the quarter as downstream value chain inventories normalised causing sales volumes to increase by 7% compared to the prior year. However, there has been a structural decline in demand from the highs of 2022. The combination of increased sales volumes and cost savings facilitated a year-on-year improvement in profitability for the segment.</p><p class=\"\">Profitability of the European business continued to recover slowly from the lows of the second half of FY2023. The improvement was driven by increased year-on-year sales volumes and cost savings, offset to some extent by selling price reductions across all product categories. A notable increase in capacity utilisation was achieved due to the successful transfer of Stockstadt and Lanaken sales volumes to our other assets following the termination of production at both mills in the prior quarter. Variable costs were 16% below last year driven by lower purchased pulp and wood costs. However, variable costs increased from the prior quarter on the back of rising pulp prices which were boosted by supply disruptions in Europe due to the Finnish port strikes and mechanical failures at a number of European pulp mills. Fixed costs were 17% below the prior year due to the strategic restructuring of the European business.</p><p class=\"\">The North American business delivered a good performance despite a slower than expected recovery in demand for graphic paper. A strong increase in paperboard sales volumes combined with cost savings offset lower selling prices for packaging. Variable costs were 9% below last year with savings achieved for all major input categories. Fixed costs were 5% above the prior year primarily due to higher personnel costs.</p><p class=\"\">The South African business delivered a solid performance with profitability benefiting from significant cost savings and a ZAR56 million forestry fair value price adjustment. Variable costs were 7% below the prior year due to lower wood, chemical and delivery costs. Fixed costs were well managed with a year-on-year increase of 6%.</p><p class=\"\">Outlook</p><p class=\"\">The third quarter is seasonally the weakest in terms of demand for our products. However, market sentiment is generally improving across all of our product segments and Sappi is well positioned with healthy cash reserves and liquidity to manage current market uncertainties.</p><p class=\"\">Dissolving pulp demand remains healthy, buoyed by low inventory levels across the VSF value chain. VSF pricing has faced downward pressure in recent weeks, which could be a risk for DP pricing in the third quarter. However, the high operating rates through the VSF value chain and relatively constrained DP supply landscape continue to offering some support for DP prices.</p><p class=\"\">Graphic papers demand is expected to continue its slow recovery in the third quarter, but the market fundamentally remains in oversupply and industry operating rates remain below historical levels. Our European restructuring programme has significantly increased our capacity utilisation which, combined with the fixed costs savings, is expected to improve our competitive position. We continue to diligently adapt our product and market mix to match demand in North America ahead of the Somerset PM2 conversion and expansion in 2025. The sale of the Stockstadt Mill site is on track to be concluded in the third quarter.</p><p class=\"\">Packaging and speciality paper markets continue to improve across all regions, and we expect good demand in North America and South Africa. Market conditions in Europe generally remain subdued due to the persistently weak economy and low consumer confidence.</p><p class=\"\">Variable costs have reduced substantially from the peak in 2023 but have plateaued in the second quarter and remain above historical levels for many of our input categories. Globally, pulp market prices have started rising which could negatively impact the profitability of our paper businesses, particularly in Europe where proactive margin management will be required. In the third quarter, the Saiccor and Somerset Mills will take scheduled maintenance shuts, which will have an estimated impact of US$30 million on group profitability.</p><p class=\"\">Capital expenditure for FY2024 is expected to be in the region of US$500 million and as previously communicated includes approximately US$154 million for the Somerset PM2 conversion and expansion project. We remain committed to disciplined capital allocation as we execute our strategy to reduce exposure to graphic paper markets while investing for growth in renewable packaging, dissolving pulp and biomaterials.</p><p class=\"\">The plantation fair value price adjustment for the third quarter is expected to be slightly negative due to higher fuel costs and discount rates.</p><p class=\"\">The full results announcement is available at www.sappi.com.</p><p class=\"\">There will be a conference call to which investors are invited.

K-pop performances played a prominent role in the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of Gangwon 2024, as well as the Let's Play Winter Festival, showcasing Korean culture both domestically and internationally.</p><p class=\"\">The Winter YOG Gangwon 2024 brought together over 1,800 talented young athletes representing 78 National Olympic Committees (NOCs). Featuring 7 sports and 15 disciplines, the event attracted some 270,000 spectators across nine venues. Taking advantage of the winter sports legacy created by PyeongChang 2018, the organisers made use of 7 out of 12 venues from the Olympic Winter Games. The YOG were widely enjoyed by local fans, as reflected in a survey where 86% rated their experience an 8 or higher out of 10.</p><p class=\"\">Gangwon 2024 not only excelled on-site, but also set new standards for digital engagement.

Additionally, the <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Gangwon 2024 virtual volunteers' community page</strong> has been launched, providing a dedicated platform for volunteers to stay connected with each other and remain engaged with the Olympic community.</p><p class=\"\">Gangwon 2024 was also marked by the dedication of its volunteer community. A total of 1,984 volunteers contributed to the Games across various zones, including event and ceremony protocol, athlete support, sports management, media coordination and regional guidance. These volunteers gained invaluable experience in organising a major sporting event, while enjoying the opportunity to witness spectacular performances firsthand. The IOC President, Thomas Bach, expressed his gratitude to the <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">\"Gangwon Shine Crew\"</strong> for their remarkable efforts in a video message to Gangwon 2024 volunteers.</p><p class=\"\">Building on the legacy of the <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">PyeongChang 2018 Winter Games</strong>, the PyeongChang Legacy Foundation (PLF) drove a variety of initiatives to inspire athletes and young people from around the world to engage in winter sports. These efforts led to impressive results, with 39 participants of PLF projects qualifying for the Winter YOG, two of whom, from developing winter nations, went on to win medals at Gangwon 2024. Agnes Campeol from Thailand won a silver medal in women's monobob, while Jonathan Lourimi of Tunisia took home a silver in men's monobob.</p><p class=\"\">Among these initiatives, the \"<strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">New Horizons Academy,</strong>\" organised by the PyeongChang Memorial Foundation and PyeongChang County, aims to promote winter sports globally. The programme focuses on supporting athletes from countries with limited winter sports infrastructure, offering them the opportunity to train at specialised camps. Of the young athletes who attended these camps, 25 - representing five sports and nine NOCs, including Colombia, Thailand and Tunisia - went on to compete at Gangwon 2024.</p><p class=\"\">The Dream Programme, a legacy initiative from PyeongChang 2018, plays an important role in bolstering sports participation and ensuring accessibility for all. Held annually for 10 days between January and February, the programme provides immersive training opportunities for youngsters aged 13 to 23 from developing countries. Since 2004, the initiative has hosted 2,500 participants from 97 nations, with 150 of them going on to become international athletes. Notably, 14 athletes who competed in Gangwon 2024 were alumni of this programme.</p><p class=\"\">Since the pre-YOG period, Gangwon 2024 has prioritised introducing local youth to winter sports and providing opportunities for accessible sports practice. Since 2020, the Soohorang and Bandabi Sports Camps have engaged 30,000 students, including 12,263 in the season leading up to the Games. These camps provided equal opportunities for disabled and non-disabled participants, featuring activities such as Olympic values education, cultural immersion, and Para ice hockey.</p><p class=\"\">The PyeongChang 2018 Legacy Foundation, which created tangible benefits through diverse cultural and educational initiatives ahead of the YOG, has evolved into the PyeongChang 2018 and Gangwon 2024 Legacy Foundation. This transition aims to ensure the delivery of long-term benefits of the YOG. Eight legacy programmes from Gangwon 2024 will continue, promoting sport among future generations and creating lasting benefits for the host region.</p><p class=\"\">View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from International Olympic Committee on 3blmedia.com.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Contact Info:</strong></p><p class=\"\">Spokesperson: International Olympic Committee</p><p class=\"\">Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/international-olympic-committee</p><p class=\"\">Email: info@3blmedia.com</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">SOURCE:</strong> International Olympic Committee</p><p class=\"\">View the original press release on ACCESS Newswire</p></span></div>",
