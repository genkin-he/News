However, there could be a potential pause in new long-term liquefied natural gas contract talks between China buyers and U.S. LNG facilities. Given that most proposed U.S. LNG facilities require that a substantial portion of their capacity is contracted under long-term deals to obtain financing, such a pause might delay new U.S. LNG export facilities reaching a final investment decision, the analysts add.

The bank suggests traders to consider long positions if prices adjust. Meanwhile, Malaysia's palm oil production is expected to remain weak due to heavy rainfall. January output is estimated to have declined 10% from the previous month to 1.34 million tons, marking a fifth consecutive decline, according to a Bloomberg survey. Inventories may have dropped 2.9% to 1.66 million tons, while exports likely slumped 14.2% to 1.15 million tons, the survey shows. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board will release official data on Monday. AmInvestment Bank pegs CPO support at 4,251 ringgit/ton and resistance at 4,453 ringgit/ton. The Bursa Malaysia Derivatives contract for April delivery is 23 ringgit higher at 4,331 ringgit/ton.
