            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">The latest U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods are likely to impact Chinese consumer sectors in short term, but the situation may improve in the longer term, according to Jefferies analysts in a commentary. \"While we think such tariff on goods sourced from China will impact brands, retailers and consumers in the short term, over time, companies should be able to digest its impact with some faring better,\" the analysts say. However, it remains uncertain whether this is the start of a trade war or if it will lead to a deal, the analysts note. Depending on a company's demand profile and gross profit margin, companies under Jefferies' coverage, such as Miniso and Anta Sports Products, should be better positioned to manage a 10% tariff increase this time around, the analysts say.

The market reactions after the weekend's tariff news were largely as expected, SEB analysts say in a note. The U.S. dollar strengthened, while trade-dependent currencies such as the euro and smaller currencies such as the Swedish krona initially took a beating. Stock markets in Europe closed about 1% lower after a late recovery. The 10% tariffs on China come into force Tuesday, but are interpreted as milder than previously feared, SEB says. China has this morning responded with its own tariffs on imports of energy raw materials, agricultural equipment and some cars from the U.S. OMXS30 closed at 2632.64, OMXN40 at 2541.08 and OBX at 1411.20.

(USFL), serves over 93 lakh customers through 24,290+ employees. USFL is the 3rd largest SFB with a loan book size of Rs.30,466cr and a deposit base of Rs.34,494cr. Gross Advances grew modestly at 10% YoY, driven by a 45% YoY increase in Affordable Housing and a 57% YoY increase in Financial Institutional Group lending. Deposit growth advanced by 16% YoY, with CASA accounts growing by 15% YoY. The CASA ratio stood at 25%. The bank is diversifying its product suite to reduce reliance on the microfinance segment, which has faced challenges. By increasing the proportion of secured assets, such as affordable housing loans, MSME loans, vehicle loans, and gold loans, the bank aims to lower its overall risk profile. This shift is evident as group loans experienced a 12% YoY decline. Net Interest Income grew by 3.1% YoY in Q3FY25, impacted by falling yields on advances and slower advance growth. Additionally, NIM contracted by 60 bps sequentially to 8.6%. The microfinance segment has faced significant challenges, leading to increased stress. The PAR for the group loan portfolio rose to 6.6% in December 2024 from 4.1% in June 2024. GNPA and NNPA have deteriorated to 2.7% and 0.6%, respectively, from 2.1% and 0.2% in Q3FY24. Due to increased stress in the microfinance segment, provisions have risen by 254% YoY to Rs. 223cr, weighing on the PAT, which has decreased by 64% YoY to Rs. 109cr.</p><p class=\"\">Outlook</p><p class=\"\">The ongoing stress in the microfinance segment is expected to keep credit costs elevated throughout FY25. The bank's strategic measures, including enhanced collections, a focus on secured lending, and a prudent approach in microfinance, are positive steps towards managing and reducing credit costs in the long term. The shift in portfolio mix is expected to impact NIM negatively. With asset quality stress in group loans stabilizing, the ROA is expected to improve from FY26 onwards. Therefore, we reiterate ACCUMULATE rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs. 41 based on 0.95x FY27E BVPS.</p><p class=\"\">For all recommendations report, click here</p><p class=\"\">Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.
