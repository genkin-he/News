(“Jupiter” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing JOTROL™, a patented resveratrol-based platform, today issued a statement regarding recent market volatility and highlighted its planned Direct-to-Consumer product launch later this year, which is expected to generate near-term revenues while the Company advances its clinical trials.</p><p class=\"\">“The recent volatility in our stock appears to be driven by misconceptions and a lack of understanding about our business and long-term strategy, but I want to reassure our investors that there have been no undisclosed material developments,” said Christer Rosén, Chairman and CEO of Jupiter Neurosciences. “Our recent announcements, including partnerships with Zina Biopharmaceuticals and Catalent Pharma Solutions, are important milestones in advancing JOTROL™ for our planned Phase 2a study in Parkinson’s disease. With these partnerships in place, we are making tangible progress in our clinical development and remain confident in the path ahead.”</p><p class=\"\">Jupiter is advancing a robust clinical pipeline addressing combined market opportunities exceeding $50 billion. The Company is focused on significant unmet needs in CNS disorders, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and rare diseases such as MPS-I, Friedreich’s Ataxia, and MELAS. With multiple Phase 2 trials scheduled to launch within the next 12 months—leveraging successful Phase 1 data demonstrating safety—Jupiter is well-positioned for meaningful clinical advancements.</p><p class=\"\">In addition to its clinical pipeline development, Jupiter is poised to generate near-term revenue with the upcoming launch of its direct-to-consumer product line in 2025. This initiative represents a key step in diversifying the Company’s business model, providing immediate cash flow while continuing to advance its pharmaceutical pipeline. Focused on the longevity and aging market, the Company expects to share more details soon about two initial products leveraging the unique bioavailability and therapeutic advantages of JOTROL™, which has demonstrated significantly enhanced bioavailability compared to traditional resveratrol formulations.</p><p class=\"\">Rosén also commented on the Company’s financial strategy: “While we remain open to strategic funding opportunities, we are committed to avoiding toxic debt and ensuring that we maintain a sustainable approach to financing our operations. With $1.76 million in NIH funding secured and an additional $16 million in grants under review, alongside the $11 million raised in our December 2024 IPO, we are well-positioned to advance our clinical and commercial initiatives. Furthermore, our strategic collaborations with Harvard University, Georgetown University, MIT’s Picower Institute for Learning &amp; Memory, and the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine enhance our research and clinical capabilities, while our efforts to build licensing and commercialization partnerships in Asia position us for future global expansion.”</p><p class=\"\">“Despite market fluctuations, our commitment to executing on our strategy remains unchanged,” said Rosén. “We believe in the potential of JOTROL™ and our broader pipeline to address neuroinflammatory diseases and aging-related health solutions. Our team remains focused on driving progress, creating value for our investors, and ultimately delivering transformative treatments for patients.”</p><p class=\"\">As always, Jupiter encourages investors to review its filings with the SEC and corporate announcements for the latest company updates.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Jupiter Neurosciences, Inc.</strong></p><p class=\"\">Jupiter Neurosciences is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on treating neuroinflammation, with a current focus on CNS disorders and rare diseases. The Company’s platform product, JOTROL™, is an enhanced orally administered resveratrol formulation designed and intended to deliver therapeutically relevant, safe levels of resveratrol. The Company’s pipeline is focused broadly on CNS disorder and includes indications such as Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, Mucopolysaccharidoses Type I, Friedreich’s Ataxia, and MELAS. More information may be found on the Company’s website www.jupiterneurosciences.com.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About JOTROL </strong></p><p class=\"\">Resveratrol is one of the world’s most extensively researched molecules. Thorough evaluation has shown that for the compound to be effective, it requires a high C-Max (~300 ng/ml of resveratrol in plasma), achievable only with doses exceeding 3 grams using earlier resveratrol products. Poor bioavailability has been a well-documented issue with resveratrol. Doses over 2 grams have been associated with severe gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, which have prevented the compound from receiving regulatory approval for any indication.</p><p class=\"\">Jupiter Neurosciences (JUNS) conducted a Phase I study demonstrating that JOTROL achieves over nine times higher bioavailability compared to resveratrol used in earlier clinical trials (e.g., Turner et al., MCI/Early Alzheimer’s Disease trial, and Yui et al., Friedreich’s Ataxia trial). The results of this Phase I study, which will be cross-referenced in all upcoming JOTROL trials, were published in the <em>Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease</em> and <em>AAPS Open</em> in February 2022.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Zina Biopharmaceuticals, LLC</strong></p><p class=\"\">Zina Biopharmaceuticals, co-founded by Professor Charbel Moussa, is a specialized consulting company providing end-to-end trial design and execution solutions as well as regulatory, scientific and medical advice for biotech and pharmaceutical companies.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS</strong></p><p class=\"\">Certain statements in this announcement are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on the Company’s current expectations, including the use of proceeds from the Offering.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">0918 ET - Much of the past few days has been about gauging how inflexible the Trump administration will be on tariffs; in other words, whether they're better understood as firm policy or a negotiating tool. Quick postponements of the Canada and Mexico tariffs point to the latter category, strategist Will Compernolle of FHN Financial writes. He notes China's retaliatory tariffs against the only barriers Trump has actually implemented so far don't start until Feb. 10. That \"implies room for negotiation, something traders may take as a sign these tariffs will not be long term,\" Compernolle writes. \"The trade relationship may nevertheless be scarred, but there's a sense, rightly or wrongly, the more maximalist policies will not be the equilibrium.\" (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)</p><p class=\"\">0835 ET - Treasury yields rise as the U.S. trade war against Mexico and Canada takes a pause while China announces retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports. Inflation concerns are rising while it remains to be seen how the Fed will react to trade tensions. December JOLTS report is due at 10 a.m. ET. ADP employment data will come tomorrow, followed by jobless claims on Thursday and nonfarm payrolls Friday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast a slowdown in job creation last month, with unemployment stable at 4.1%. The 10-year is at 4.577% and the two-year at 4.257%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)</p><p class=\"\">0722 ET - The U.K. might have to pick a side between the U.S. and Europe in a trade conflict even if it avoids direct U.S. tariffs, Pantheon Macroeconomics economists say in a note. \"The EU has reportedly prepared retaliation should President Trump apply tariffs to the eurozone, and we doubt the U.K. could stand neutral in the middle,\" they say. Britain is highly exposed to global trade disruption because total exports and imports are worth 64% of GDP, the economists say. The U.K. might need to take Trump's other threats, including tax cuts and deportations that threaten to raise global inflation, more seriously given that other countries could respond with fiscal stimulus. Trump's actions would be hawkish for U.K. policy, they say. (edward.frankl@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0631 ET - Gold futures slip, though they remain close to all-time highs reached in Monday's session. Futures are down 0.55% at $2,841.40 a troy ounce, after hitting a record $2,872 in the prior session. Gold spot prices are flat on $2,814.43 an ounce. The precious metal is holding close to highs as the U.S. dollar weakens, ActivTrades' Ricardo Evangelista says in a note. The greenback gave up gains after the Trump administration delayed higher tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a month. That said, Washington hasn't backed down on tariffs for Chinese imports. As Beijing retaliates, the threat of an all-out trade war escalates, Evangelista says. This scenario casts a dark shadow over global economic growth prospects, naturally driving increased safe-haven demand and creating scope for further gold gains, Evangelista writes. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0627 ET - The cost of insuring euro credit against default using credit default swaps stays steady after the U.S. delayed tariffs on Canada and Mexico by a month. \"Tariff-related volatility has subsided to an extent following news that both Mexico and Canada had managed to delay the imposition of new import costs,\" IG analysts say in a note. The iTraxx Europe Crossover index which tracks euro junk bond CDS is unchanged at 294 basis points, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence data show. The iTraxx Europe Senior Financials index which tracks euro investment-grade financial bonds CDS is steady at 61bps. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0621 ET - Bitcoin falls, albeit remaining above lows hit Monday when risky assets were stung by U.S. President Trump announcing 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. He later agreed to delay these tariffs, providing some brief relief but risks remains and a new 10% tariff on China took effect Tuesday. \"China's tariffs keep risk high and cause cryptos to retreat,\" Saxo analysts say in a note. Uncertainty remains and the China tariffs mean further retaliation is possible, they say. Bitcoin falls 3.1% to $98,742 after hitting a three-and-a-half-week low of $91,439 Monday, according to LSEG. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0614 ET - The Bank of England could cut interest rates only twice more, including once at this week's meeting, pausing rate reductions by the second half of the year, Berenberg's Andrew Wishart says in a note. Concerns about weak growth and rising unemployment rate are likely to result in faster initial rate reductions, but fears about a rebound in U.K. inflation could then cause the BOE to pause, he says. \"Rising government spending and rate cuts will encourage demand and allow firms to cover higher costs by raising prices.\" Berenberg expects U.K. inflation could reaccelerate to 3.0% in 2025. U.K. money markets price in three rate cuts this year, though a second reduction isn't fully priced in until June. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0544 ET - The Canadian dollar remain vulnerable even after President Trump agreed to pause 25% tariffs on Canada, Monex Europe analysts say in a note. Any celebrations look somewhat premature, they say. \"The Canadian government will likely have to make much more onerous concessions to ensure that the tariff threat is lifted permanently, and this appears far from a done deal to us.\" This recent drama could resume in a few weeks with risks that next time won't result in another deal for U.S. tariffs to be suspended, they say. USD/CAD trades flat at 1.4434 after hitting a 22-year high of 1.4793 Monday, according to FactSet. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0529 ET - The Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates when it announces a decision Thursday, and it could hint at another interest-rate cut in March, Berenberg's senior economist Andrew Wishart says in a note. \"Until now, the BOE has cut at alternate meetings, but a stagnating economy and declining employment argue for more urgent action,\" he says. Markets price in a total of 30 basis points of interest-rate cuts in February and March, LSEG Refinitiv data show. \"It is sensible for the BOE to lower interest rates to prevent a larger drop in [U.K.] employment,\" Wishart says. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0527 ET - China's tariff retaliation is smaller than expected and largely symbolic, Morningstar analyst Kai Wang says in a note. Trump's latest 10% blanket tariff on Chinese goods has an immediate impact only on some industries, such as home appliances, lithium batteries and EVs, the analyst says. Wang notes that the products included in China's countermeasures, such as coal and liquefied natural gas, accounted for just 12% of the country's imports from the U.S., implying less risk than previously expected. However, the analyst still warns of the possibility of an escalating trade war given Trump's unpredictability.(sherry.qin@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0508 ET - Donald Trump's trade policy announcements over the weekend raise the question of whether there is a bigger risk from tariffs to the eurozone than previously thought, according to Capital Economics' Andrew Kenningham. A 10% universal tariff imposed by the U.S. might shave 0.1% to 0.2% off eurozone GDP, he says in a note. But a 25% tariff, as imposed but suspended on Canada and Mexico, would have a more-than-proportionately larger effect because it would be harder for companies and exchange-rate moves to cushion the blow, Kenningham warns. A ball-park estimate is that would cut eurozone GDP by around 0.5%, leaving growth close to zero this year. Additionally, a prohibitive tariff of, say, 100% on European vehicles could on its own push Germany into recession. (edward.frankl@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0505 ET - The dollar could suffer a further pullback if the U.S. and China move towards a de-escalation in their trade dispute, ING analyst Francesco Pesole says in a note. A new 10% U.S. tariff on China took effect Tuesday and China has announced retaliatory tariffs. Markets seem to price in a good chance of the U.S. and China striking a deal and delaying tariffs after Trump agreed to pause planned 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. However, the case for significant dollar depreciation is weak as the tariff threat remains, Pesole says. Trump has \"more concretely introduced the tariff threat into daily market news.\" The DXY dollar index falls 0.5% to 108.484. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
