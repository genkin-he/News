However, the fourth quarter of 2024 saw a net loss attributable to the corporation of $32 million, or a diluted loss per share of 11 cents, compared to net earnings of $154 million and EPS of 49 cents in the same period of 2023.</p><p class=\"\">Full-year comparable net earnings were $977 million, or $3.17 per diluted share, up from $920 million, or $2.90 per diluted share, in 2023.

This strategic shift allowed the company to focus on its core aluminum packaging business. The company is also exploring strategic partnerships for its aluminum cup business, which has not met initial growth expectations.</p><p class=\"\">Additionally, Ball Corporation entered into an agreement to sell a portion of its ownership in Ball United Arab Can Manufacturing Company, expected to close in the first half of 2025.
