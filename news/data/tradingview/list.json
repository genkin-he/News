The fact that stocks finished Monday lower even after tariffs on Canada and Mexico were delayed at the last minute shows markets are not out of the woods yet.</p><p class=\"\">The additional 10% tariffs on China still took effect, and the world's second-biggest economy was quick to retaliate with levies on gas, coal, and machinery among other things. Other places, such as the European Union, will soon reach the top of Trump's to-do list — and it might not be quite so easy for them to strike a deal to avoid tariffs. And the possibility remains that import taxes on Canada and Mexico could still come into force next month.</p><p class=\"\">The good news is that the worst-case scenarios from tariffs — runaway inflation, recession, Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes — still seem overblown. Investors who woke up Monday wondering if it was time to get out of the market should be able to sleep easier. The bad news is that the market still has other problems — overreliance on technology stocks, the threat from Chinese artificial intelligence start-ups like DeepSeek, and historically high valuations, to name a few.</p><p class=\"\">The tariff threat isn't completely gone — U.K.-based Diageo, the maker of Don Julio tequila in Mexico, Crown Royal whiskey in Canada, and Guinness stout in Ireland said Tuesday that uncertainty means it can't provide financial guidance.</p><p class=\"\">Enjoy the relief for now, but more market turbulence has yet to come.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Brian Swint</li></ul><p class=\"\">***</p><p class=\"\">Beijing Retaliates as U.S. Levies Kick In</p><p class=\"\">The Trump administration's tariffs on China went into effect early Tuesday and Beijing immediately retaliated with levies of its own on U.S. goods. President Donald Trump paused the 25% tariffs he had announced on imports from Mexico and Canada for a month after meeting separately with the leaders of both nations Monday.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Additional 10% tariffs on goods from China took effect overnight. Beijing   announced import taxes of 15% on U.S. crude oil, machinery, and some cars,   as well as a 10% increase on coal and liquefied natural gas. It also   announced export controls on scarce materials critical for making   electronics.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Separately, China added Calvin Klein owner PVH Corp. and biotechnology   company Illumina to its unreliable entity list and opened an antitrust   probe into Google.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada is implementing its   $1.3 billion border reinforcement plan -- increasing resources to stop   the flow of the drug fentanyl, and posting nearly 10,000 personnel at the   border. Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo is also moving 10,000   troops to the border.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Different views of tariffs have emerged within the administration.   Economic advisors such as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have   downplayed them. He described Trump's strategy as \"escalate to   de-escalate,\" implying levies are a negotiation tool. </li></ul><p class=\"\">What's Next: The delay of measures on Mexico and Canada was welcomed by investors but China may present a bigger problem ahead. Avoiding tariffs appears to be Trump's real plan, said Stifel's Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy strategist.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Matt Peterson , Janet H. Cho , and Brian Swint</li></ul><p class=\"\">***</p><p class=\"\">Musk's Effort to Erase Agency Independence Challenges Congress</p><p class=\"\">Elon Musk and President Donald Trump are shattering longstanding beliefs about the limits of presidential power, bringing to heel Washington agencies that have sought to operate with at least some independence from the White House. Some legal scholars and lawmakers see a constitutional crisis forming.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">The moves could face court challenges and define the limits of   presidential power for years to come, experts said. If left standing,   Trump and Musk will have effectively found a back door way to seize   Congress's power to appropriate funds for the executive branch, making it   easier to cut the budget.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has effectively shut the U.S.   Agency for International Development, which provides humanitarian and   other foreign aid. The agency's website was pulled offline, and USAID   employees were told to stay home on Monday.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">DOGE is pursuing the General Services Administration, the independent   agency that manages federal properties and office space and handles   billions of dollars in government contracts. DOGE has already canceled   some federal leases, and Musk has suggested that GSA could unilaterally   choose to stop billions in other payments.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was named acting director of the   Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after former director Rohit Chopra   was fired. Bessent halted rule making, enforcement, and hiring. The   Securities and Exchange Commission's leaders told agency lawyers they had   to seek permission to launch probes. </li></ul><p class=\"\">What's Next: The State Department launched its own USAID page and Secretary Marco Rubio said he was acting director. The move would be contrary to the law that enabled the creation of USAID, said William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. The Supreme Court may ultimately have to decide.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Joe Light and Janet H. Cho</li></ul><p class=\"\">***</p><p class=\"\">New U.S. Sovereign Wealth Fund Could Be TikTok's Solution</p><p class=\"\">The U.S. is getting a sovereign-wealth fund, its first, after President Donald Trump directed the Treasury and Commerce Departments to create one. One beneficiary could be the video-sharing app TikTok, which Trump granted extra time to find a buyer to avoid a U.S. ban.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">In an Oval Office signing ceremony, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said   a sovereign-wealth fund would allow the U.S. government to make money by   investing some of its assets. About 90 state-owned investment funds   manage more than $8 trillion, the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth   Funds said.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Such funds operate as institutional money managers for their nations.   Among the biggest are sovereign-wealth funds run by the government of   China, which funded these vehicles beginning in 2007. According to   Foreign Policy magazine, the Chinese Investment Corp.'s funds total more   than $2 trillion in assets.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Sovereign-wealth funds act as savings funds for rich countries, as   stabilization funds for governments managing inconsistent revenue sources,   or as strategic funds to facilitate domestic economic policies, according   to IFSWF. It's unclear what type of fund the U.S. would create, how it   will operate, and how it will be financed.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">After the Biden administration signed a law banning TikTok from U.S. app   stores unless its parent, the China-based ByteDance divested it, Trump   granted an extension to comply with that law while he consults with   advisors on national security concerns posed by TikTok. </li></ul><p class=\"\">What's Next: That makes TikTok potentially a target for the fund, Trump suggested on Monday. Bessent, a hedge fund manager, indicated during the Oval Office signing ceremony that the new sovereign-wealth fund will be ready to go in 12 months.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Abby Schultz and Liz Moyer</li></ul><p class=\"\">***</p><p class=\"\">Palantir Demolishes Expectations on Earnings Growth</p><p class=\"\">Palantir Technologies blew past expectations and described continued momentum in its U.S. business, which has expanded by double digit percentages over the past year amid the frenzy for artificial intelligence.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">The software maker reported earnings of 14 cents a share, up 75% from a   year earlier, and revenue of $828 million, up 36%. Wall Street focused on   its outlook, seeing first quarter revenue of $858 million to $862 million,   a gain of 36% from last year and above forecasts.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Palantir is known primarily as a defense and intelligence agency, but its   U.S. commercial business is pushing growth higher. Revenue was up 64% on   the year for this end market and the backlog almost doubled. Total   bookings were up 134%. U.S. government revenue grew by 45% from 2023.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">CEO Alex Karp said a shareholder letter that \"the momentum we are seeing   across sectors, both commercial and government, is unlike anything that   has come before.\" </li></ul><p class=\"\">What's Next: Palantir believes that it is uniquely situated to benefit from a new commoditized AI cost structure. \"With the proliferation of AI models, the raw AI labor supply is exploding,\" said chief revenue officer Ryan Taylor.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Josh Nathan-Kazis</p><p class=\"\">When CEO Albert Bourla presents Pfizer's financial results on Tuesday morning, investors will be looking for any sign of a turnaround after another year of underperformance.</p><p class=\"\">Pfizer shares fell nearly 50% from the start of 2023 through the end of 2024, while the S&amp;P 500 climbed just over 50%. A Pfizer shareholder has halved her money over that period, while missing out on a shot at historic gains.</p><p class=\"\">Most of Pfizer's losses came in 2023, but the stock failed to recover in 2024. At an investor conference in early January, Bourla said that the company had cut costs, revamped its sales operation, and made other big fixes.</p><p class=\"\">Those efforts have yet to satisfy investors.</p><p class=\"\">Analysts expect the company to report fourth-quarter earnings of 47 cents a share from sales of $17.4 billion, according to FactSet.</p><p class=\"\">In December, the company rolled out initial guidance for 2025 that investors took as bullish, sending shares up slightly. The company expects revenue of between $61 billion and $64 billion, and adjusted per-share earnings of between $2.80 and $3.</p><p class=\"\">Pfizer's earnings call comes at a turbulent moment, as the Trump administration introduces new tariffs that have upset the financial markets. Bourla's public statements on the new administration have so far been overwhelmingly positive.</p><p class=\"\">\"When you have radical change [it is] always coming with risks and opportunities,\" Bourla said at the investor conference in January. But he said that he thinks \"the opportunities outweigh the risks\" under Trump.</p><p class=\"\">One question now for Bourla, and one he will likely face on Tuesday, is whether the new tariffs could damage Pfizer in the near term, and whether he remains optimistic about the new regime.</p><p class=\"\">Meanwhile, Bourla seems to have brushed off what had seemed a formidable challenge from Starboard Value, which reportedly built a $1 billion stake in Pfizer last year. The activist investor slammed the company's performance in a much-discussed presentation that asserted that Pfizer \"management has failed\" to deliver on important commitments.</p><p class=\"\">Bloomberg reported last week, however, that Starboard hadn't nominated any new board members ahead of an April annual meeting, and that the deadline for nominations had passed on Jan. 25.</p><p class=\"\">Pfizer is facing a major string of patent expirations beginning in 2026 that will scrape between $17 billion and $18 billion off the company's revenue by the end of the decade. The company hopes to close that gap with sales of products it has acquired in a recent spending spree.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Josh Nathan-Kazis at josh.nathan-kazis@barrons.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
