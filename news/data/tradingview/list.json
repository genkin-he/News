While investors have some more details on his tariff plans since then — and the near-miss to start February — in many ways, the trade landscape remains just as uncertain. </p><p class=\"\">As a consequence, BMO expects front-running ahead of tariffs will add additional noise to the data until tariffs are implemented or their threat dissipates. </p><p class=\"\">Exports jumped 4.9% month over month, their largest increase in almost a year. Growth was broad-based but led by energy (+9.5%, partially on higher prices) and metal and non-metallic mineral products (+9.2%). Meantime, imports rose 2.3%, again with increases across most product categories. </p><p class=\"\">In volume terms, exports increased 11.6% a.r. while imports were up 8.6% a.r. in Q4. It looks like trade will add to Q4 gross domestic product growth when investors get the latter report at the end of the month, pointed out the bank. </p><p class=\"\">Separately, the services trade shortfall narrowed from C$443 million to C$67 million in December, its smallest gap since entering deficit territory in late summer. Canada's overall trade balance — goods plus services — improved from a C$1.4 billion deficit to a C$600 million surplus in December. </p><p class=\"\">Canada's normally volatile trade figures are subject to even more noise given tariff uncertainty at the turn of the year, stated BMO. Tariff front-running likely contributed to December's increase in trade activity, with the weaker Canadian dollar (CAD or loonie) providing a helping hand, supporting economic growth to end 2024. </p><p class=\"\">The bank wouldn't be surprised if the early 2025 trade figures are subject to heightened volatility, not unlike broader financial markets, as investors await more certainty on the U.S. trade tariff front.</p></span></div>",

            "title": "LionHeart Family Institute Raises Concerns Over Academic Pressures on Christian Researchers",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Jacksonville, Florida--(Newsfile Corp. - February 5, 2025) - The LionHeart Family Institute has expressed concerns about mounting pressures on researchers who explore controversial topics in child health and family studies. According to the organization, several academics have recently faced professional challenges—ranging from temporary suspensions to heightened scrutiny—for conducting research that questions mainstream academic perspectives on gender identity, child psychology, and related fields.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Temporary Suspensions and Increased Scrutiny</strong></p><p class=\"\">Over the past week, three professors from prominent universities have been placed on temporary leave. The professors' work, according to LionHeart, focused on examining how family values and religious beliefs shape child development and health outcomes. In addition to their suspensions, these scholars have reportedly come under increased scrutiny from private consultants and advocacy groups who question their research methodologies and the sources of their funding.</p><p class=\"\">Daryl Wilson, spokesperson for LionHeart, stated, \"There is a growing trend of silencing academic voices that offer alternative perspectives. Instead of encouraging open dialogue, certain institutions appear to be curbing the freedom to investigate and share findings that diverge from dominant ideologies.\"</p><p class=\"\">The organization asserts that this atmosphere of scrutiny deters researchers from pursuing studies that could offer valuable insights into family-centered approaches to child well-being, including the role of religion, traditional family structures, and non-mainstream therapeutic methods.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Concerns About Research Funding Bias</strong></p><p class=\"\">LionHeart Family Institute has further raised concerns about the allocation of research funding in child health and psychology. The group contends that many grant opportunities prioritize studies that affirm certain medical and psychological interventions for minors, such as gender-affirming treatments, while studies supported by religious or family-oriented foundations often face additional hurdles.</p><p class=\"\">\"Many academic institutions and funding bodies seem to favor research that aligns with prevailing social and political agendas,\" said Dr. John Leo Grimani, CEO of LionHeart Family Institute. \"Researchers exploring different paradigms—particularly those informed by faith-based values or traditional family dynamics—often find it difficult to secure funding or gain acceptance within the academic community.\"</p><p class=\"\">Grimani added that the uneven distribution of resources and attention creates a research environment where some voices are amplified while others are marginalized. \"Scientific inquiry should be grounded in empirical evidence and ethical consideration. It must also allow room for a range of approaches. When funding structures and institutional pressures skew heavily in one direction, it undermines the principles of academic fairness and intellectual diversity,\" he said.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">A Call for Academic Freedom and Neutrality</strong></p><p class=\"\">In light of these challenges, LionHeart Family Institute is calling on universities and research institutions to uphold the principles of academic freedom and impartiality. The organization emphasizes the importance of fostering an environment where researchers can freely investigate topics without fear of reprisal, provided they adhere to rigorous ethical and methodological standards.</p><p class=\"\">\"Academic freedom is not just about protecting individual scholars; it's about ensuring that the academic community as a whole remains a place where diverse ideas can flourish,\" said Grimani. \"When institutions take a neutral stance and allow data-driven research to speak for itself, everyone benefits—students, families, policymakers, and society at large.\"</p><p class=\"\">LionHeart also urged institutions to resist external pressures, whether from advocacy groups, private consultants, or other organizations. The group suggested that universities establish clearer guidelines and stronger safeguards to protect researchers from undue influence or retaliation.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Ensuring Open Scientific Debate</strong></p><p class=\"\">The broader message from LionHeart Family Institute is a plea for open and robust scientific discourse. While acknowledging that controversial topics can spark intense debate, the organization insists that the solution is not to silence dissenting views but to engage with them in a constructive manner.</p><p class=\"\">\"Open scientific debate is the foundation of progress,\" Grimani concluded. \"Without it, we risk turning academic institutions into echo chambers rather than spaces for true intellectual exploration. We stand for a balanced approach that values all evidence-based perspectives and upholds the integrity of the scientific process.\"</p><p class=\"\">The LionHeart Family Institute plans to continue advocating for these principles at conferences, in publications, and through ongoing dialogues with academic leaders. By championing a fair, open, and unbiased research environment, the organization hopes to contribute to a culture of inquiry that serves the common good and supports the well-being of children and families everywhere.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Media Contact:</strong></p><p class=\"\">LionHeart Family Institute Press Office</p><p class=\"\">+1-415-559-0665</p><p class=\"\">Office@lionheartfamilyinstitute.com</p><p class=\"\">lionheartfamilyinstitute.com</p><p class=\"\">To view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/239110</p></span></div>",
