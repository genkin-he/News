            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">WAFD INC, a prominent player in the financial services industry, has released its Form 10-Q report for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance and operational highlights for the three months ended December 31, 2024. This summary delves into the key financial metrics and business activities that shaped the company's performance during this period.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Financial Highlights</strong></p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Net Income:</strong> The company recorded a net income of $47.267 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024, compared to $58.453 million for the prior year quarter. This decrease is attributed to greater growth in interest-bearing liabilities than in interest-earning assets.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Net Interest Income:</strong> Net interest income for the quarter was $155.431 million, which is $3.194 million lower than the same quarter of the prior year. This decline is largely due to a decrease in net interest margin from 2.91% to 2.39%.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Net Interest Margin:</strong> The net interest margin decreased to 2.39% for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, from 2.91% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. This reduction is primarily due to a greater increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities compared to the decrease in the average rate earned on interest-earning assets.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Non-Interest Income:</strong> Total non-interest income increased by $1.535 million to $15.702 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024. This growth is primarily due to income growth from WaFd Insurance and increases in overall fee income as a result of the Merger.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Non-Interest Expense:</strong> Total other expense was $111.311 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $14.771 million from the prior year quarter. This rise is largely due to increased occupancy and compensation costs post-Merger and a $5.4 million restructuring charge.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Business Highlights</strong></p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Revenue Segments:</strong> The company continues to focus on commercial lending, with commercial loan originations accounting for 68% of total originations and consumer loan originations making up 32% during the period. The loan portfolio is diversified across multi-family, commercial real estate, commercial &amp; industrial, construction, and land acquisition &amp; development categories.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Geographical Performance:</strong> The loan portfolio is distributed across several states, with significant concentrations in Washington (27.7%), California (14.4%), and Texas (11.7%). The company has maintained stable geographic distribution with minor changes in the percentage of loans by state compared to the previous quarter.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Sales Units:</strong> The company reported an increase in loans receivable by $144,147,000, indicating growth in lending activities. Commercial loan originations were a significant contributor to this growth.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Operational Risks:</strong> The company is managing various operational risks, including fluctuating interest rates, cybersecurity threats, and the integration of Luther Burbank Corporation. Additionally, the company is navigating changes in business structure, such as exiting the single-family mortgage lending market.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Interest Rate Risk Management:</strong> The company has taken steps to reduce its interest rate risk profile by growing shorter-term loans and transaction deposit accounts. The mix of transaction and savings accounts is 55% of total deposits, and the investment securities portfolio is composed of 54% variable and 46% fixed rate.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Future Outlook:</strong> The company is focused on managing interest rate risk and maintaining a strong equity position to support controlled growth. Management believes that the company's strong equity position allows it to manage balance sheet risk effectively in a regulated environment.</p><p class=\"\">SEC Filing: <a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/936528/000093652825000040/wfsl-20241231.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">WAFD INC [ WAFD ] - 10-Q - Feb. 04, 2025</a></p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">TORONTO, Feb.  04, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Allied Properties Real Estate Investment Trust (\"Allied\") (TSX: \"AP.UN\") today announced results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2024. “Our occupied and leased area remained steady for the third consecutive quarter, and our urban workspace portfolio continued to outperform in terms of occupancy and rent growth in all urban submarkets other than Vancouver,” said Cecilia Williams, President &amp; CEO. “With demand rising in our cities and across our three workspace formats, we expect to increase our occupied and leased area and propel rent growth over the course of 2025.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Operations</strong></p><p class=\"\">Allied’s portfolio is comprised of three urban workspace formats. Allied Heritage is a format created through the adaptive re-use of light industrial structures for office use above grade and retail use at grade. The buildings are inherently distinctive, clustered in the urban core and generally low-rise. Allied Modern is a format created specifically for office use. The buildings are generally mid- to high-rise, clustered in the urban core and distinctive by virtue of design, integration with heritage structure and/or integration with the different elements of mixed-use, amenity-rich urban neighbourhoods. Located primarily in Toronto, Allied Flex is a limited format for buildings that Allied intends to redevelop comprehensively within a five-to 10-year period. Because of the near-term transformation of these buildings, Allied can make workspace in them available profitably and on more flexible than normal terms for users.</p><p class=\"\">Utilization of, and demand for, Allied's workspace continued to strengthen in the fourth quarter. In the Montréal, Calgary and Vancouver rental portfolios, demand for Allied Heritage was most pronounced. In the Toronto rental portfolio, demand was strong across all three formats.</p><p class=\"\">Allied conducted 255 lease tours in its rental portfolio in the fourth quarter. Its occupied and leased area at the end of the quarter was 85.9% and 87.2%, respectively. Allied renewed 69% of the leases maturing in the quarter, much closer to its normal level of 70% to 75%.</p><p class=\"\">Allied leased a total of 571,298 square feet of GLA in the fourth quarter, 527,978 square feet in its rental portfolio and 43,320 square feet in its development portfolio. Of the 527,978 square feet Allied leased in its rental portfolio, 84,724 square feet were vacant, 212,834 square feet were maturing in the quarter and 230,420 square feet were maturing after the quarter. 56,077 square feet of the vacant space leased in the quarter involved expansion by existing users, a long-standing trend in Allied's rental portfolio that appears to be regaining momentum.</p><p class=\"\">Average in-place net rent per occupied square foot continued its steady improvement, ending the fourth quarter at $25.41. Allied continued to achieve rent increases on renewal in the fourth quarter (up 2.0% ending-to-starting base rent and up 5.9% average-to-average base rent).</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">2024 Acquisitions and Non-Core Property Sales</strong></p><p class=\"\">“We remain committed to our vision, mission and core strategy,” said Michael Emory, Founder &amp; Executive Chair. “Given our confidence in the future of Canada’s major cities, we’ll continue to grow our business with a view to serving knowledge-based organizations ever more comprehensively and successfully over time.”</p><p class=\"\">In 2024, Allied acquired three triple-A urban properties for $677 million — 400 West Georgia Street in Vancouver, the remaining 50% interest in 19 Duncan Street in Toronto and an additional 16.7% interest in the residential component of TELUS Sky (now known as “Calgary House”), bringing its ownership to 50%. The aggregate acquisition price was below development and replacement cost.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">400 West Georgia is comprised of 340,846 square feet of office GLA, 6,546 square feet of retail GLA and 163 underground parking stalls. The property is 82% leased to Deloitte, Apple, Northeastern University, Spaces, RBC, a local café and a local restaurant, all with a weighted-average lease term of 11 years. Completed in late 2023, the property is designated LEED Platinum.</li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">19 Duncan is comprised of 149,230 square feet of office GLA, 3,570 square feet of retail GLA, 464 rental-residential units, related common areas and facilities, 25 underground commercial parking stalls and 106 underground residential parking stalls. The office component is fully leased to Thomson Reuters with a weighted-average lease term of 8.6 years. The lease-up of the residential component is underway and is expected to be completed in early 2026. With the office component completed in late 2023 and the residential component (known as “Toronto House”) to be completed shortly, the property is designed to, and applying for designation as, LEED Gold.</li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Calgary House is comprised of 326 rental-residential units, related common areas and 176 underground parking stalls. The property is 91.8% leased. Completed in late 2020, the property is designated LEED Gold.</li></ul><p class=\"\">Allied paid for the three triple-A urban properties by (i) converting loans receivable of $232 million into equity and (ii) incurring $445 million of short-term, variable-rate debt on 400 West Georgia and 19 Duncan. Allied has since replaced the debt on 400 West Georgia with a first mortgage of $180 million at 5.25% per annum for a term of five and one-half years. Allied has since sold seven lower-yielding, non-core properties — four in Montréal, one in Toronto, one in Ottawa and one in Calgary — for $229 million, which was allocated to debt repayment in the fourth quarter.</p><p class=\"\">In Management’s view, the temporary contraction in cashflow per unit resulting from the acquisition of 400 West Georgia and 19 Duncan represents an investment in the future, one that will drive earnings and value growth on completion of lease-up by 2026. Management is also of the view that the two properties are important in meaningfully augmenting the Allied Modern format in two of Canada’s most important urban office markets.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">2024 Balance-Sheet Management</strong></p><p class=\"\">By the end of 2024, Allied</p><p class=\"\">(i) reduced the amount drawn on its $800 million unsecured revolving operating facility to nil, affording it considerable liquidity going into 2025,</p><p class=\"\">(ii) reduced short-term, variable rate debt to $153 million, representing 3.5% of its total debt,</p><p class=\"\">(iii) had a total debt ratio(1) of 41.7% and</p><p class=\"\">(iv) had net debt as a multiple of annualized adjusted EBITDA(1) of 10.8x.</p><p class=\"\">Allied is committed to maintaining and ultimately improving its access to the debt capital markets and will continue to manage its balance sheet accordingly.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Outlook</strong></p><p class=\"\">Allied is experiencing steady demand for urban workspace, urban rental-residential space and urban amenity space, as well as strong and quantifiable engagement among users of space in its portfolio generally. Management expects this to underpin growth in same-asset NOI(1) in 2025 of approximately 2%. With the higher overall interest cost flowing from the 2024 acquisitions, Management expects FFO(1) and AFFO(1) per unit to contract in 2025 by approximately 4%.</p><p class=\"\">Allied’s specific operating goals for year-end 2025 are as follows:</p><p class=\"\">(i) to have reached occupied and leased area of at least 90%;</p><p class=\"\">(ii) to have sold lower-yielding, non-core properties, primarily in Montréal, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver, for at least $300 million and at or above IFRS value, with allocation of proceeds to debt repayment;</p><p class=\"\">(iii) to have fully monetized its loan receivable secured by 150 West Georgia Street in Vancouver with allocation of proceeds to debt repayment; and</p><p class=\"\">(iv) to have net debt as a multiple of annualized adjusted EBITDA below 10x, despite an expected temporary increase in the first quarter of 2025.</p><p class=\"\">_____________________________________________________________________________</p><p class=\"\">(1) This is a non-GAAP measure.

Analyst Andre Fromyhr writes in a note that the stronger U.S. dollar makes Brambles' free cashflow guidance more challenging than when it was announced. Even so, he expects the global pallet giant to maintain guidance. Fromyhr reckons that Brambles needs to consistently deliver US$800 million annual free cashflow without strong price growth or dropping capex before the stock rerates further. UBS lifts its target price 18% to A$22.50 and keeps a buy rating on the stock, which is at A$19.26 ahead of the open. (stuart.condie@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

Honeycutt, President and Chief Executive Officer.  \"This capped off a strong full-year performance in which our talented team, powered by the Veralto Enterprise System, executed well on our strategic priorities and delivered core sales growth, margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share above our initial guidance.\" Honeycutt continued, \"From an end market perspective, demand continued to strengthen throughout 2024 highlighted by industrial water treatment in North America and the recovery of consumer-packaged goods markets globally.\"</p><p class=\"\">\"We begin 2025 with a stronger financial position and a more positive view of our end markets relative to 2024.  We believe the durability of our businesses, fortified by the Veralto Enterprise System, will enable us to successfully navigate a globally dynamic macroeconomic environment. For the full year 2025, we are targeting low-to-mid single digit core sales growth with another year of margin expansion and strong cash generation. Over the long term, we expect to drive value creation through disciplined capital allocation, with a bias towards acquisitions that enhance our ability to help customers deliver clean water, safe food and trusted essential goods,\" concluded Honeycutt.</p><p class=\"\">2025 Guidance</p><p class=\"\">The Company provides forecasted sales only on a non-GAAP basis because of the difficulty in estimating the other components of GAAP sales, such as currency translation, acquisitions, and divestitures.</p><p class=\"\">For the first quarter of 2025, Veralto anticipates that non-GAAP core sales will grow low-to-mid-single digits year-over-year with adjusted operating profit margin between 24.0% and 24.5% and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.84 to $0.88 per share.</p><p class=\"\">For the full year 2025, the Company anticipates that non-GAAP core sales will grow low-to-mid-single digits year-over-year and that adjusted operating profit margin will expand 25 to 50 basis points year-over-year.  The Company is targeting adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.60 to $3.70 with free cash flow conversion in the range of 90% to 100% of GAAP net earnings.</p><p class=\"\">Conference Call and Webcast Information</p><p class=\"\">Veralto will discuss its fourth quarter results and financial guidance for 2025 during its quarterly investor conference call tomorrow starting at 8:30 a.m. (ET).

Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing Veralto Corporation's (\"Veralto\" or the \"Company\") results that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure, help our investors:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">with respect to the profitability-related non-GAAP measures, understand   the long-term profitability trends of our business and compare our   profitability to prior and future periods and to our peers;   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">with respect to core sales and related sales measures, identify   underlying growth trends in our business and compare our sales   performance with prior and future periods and to our peers; and   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">with respect to free cash flow and related cash flow measures (the \"FCF   Measure\"), understand Veralto's ability to generate cash without external   financings, strengthen its balance sheet, invest in its business and grow   its business through acquisitions and other strategic opportunities   (although a limitation of free cash flow is that it does not take into   account the Company's non-discretionary expenditures, and as a result the   entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for   discretionary expenditures). </li></ul><p class=\"\">Management uses these non-GAAP measures to measure the Company's operating and financial performance.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures set forth above have been   excluded for the following reasons:   <br/> -- Amortization of Intangible Assets:  We exclude the amortization of <br/> acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and   timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing,   size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While   we have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not   acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an   acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and   related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can   vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of   this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons   of operating results over time between our newly acquired and   long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and   non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe however that it is   important for investors to understand that such intangible assets   contribute to sales generation and that intangible asset   amortization related to past acquisitions will recur in future   periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized.   <br/> -- Restructuring Charges:  We exclude costs incurred pursuant to <br/> discrete restructuring plans that are fundamentally different (in   terms of the size, strategic nature and planning requirements, as   well as the inconsistent frequency, of such plans) from the   ongoing productivity improvements that result from application of   the Veralto Enterprise System. Because these restructuring plans   are incremental to the core activities that arise in the ordinary   course of our business and we believe are not indicative of   Veralto's ongoing operating costs in a given period, we exclude   these costs to facilitate a more consistent comparison of   operating results over time.   <br/> -- Other Adjustments:  With respect to the other items excluded from <br/> the profitability-related non-GAAP measures, we exclude these   items because they are of a nature and/or size that occur with   inconsistent frequency, occur for reasons that may be unrelated to   Veralto's commercial performance during the period and/or we   believe that such items may obscure underlying business trends and   make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.   <br/> -- Standalone Adjustments:  We believe these adjustments provide <br/> additional insight into how our businesses are performing, on a   normalized basis. However, these non-GAAP financial measures   should not be construed as inferring that our future results will   be unaffected by the items for which the measure adjusts. </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">With respect to core operating profit margin changes, in addition to the   explanation set forth in the bullets above relating to \"restructuring   charges\" and \"other adjustments\", we exclude the impact of businesses   owned for less than one year (or disposed of during such period and not   treated as discontinued operations) because the timing, size, number and   nature of such transactions can vary significantly from period to period   and may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of   long-term performance difficult.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">With respect to core sales related measures, (1) we exclude the impact of   currency translation because it is not under management's control, is   subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and (2)   we exclude the effect of acquisitions and divested product lines because   the timing, size, number and nature of such transactions can vary   significantly from period-to-period and between us and our peers, which   we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of   long-term performance difficult.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">With respect to the FCF Measure, we exclude payments for additions to   property, plant and equipment (net of the proceeds from capital   disposals) to demonstrate the amount of operating cash flow for the   period that remains after accounting for the Company's capital   expenditure requirements. </li></ul><p class=\"\">View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/veralto-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results-302367881.html</p><p class=\"\">SOURCE Veralto</p><p class=\"\">/CONTACT: Investor Relations Contact: Ryan Taylor, Vice President, Investor Relations, investors@veralto.com; Media Relations Contact: Steve Field, Vice President, Communications, steve.field@veralto.com</p></span></div>",
