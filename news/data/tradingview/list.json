That's the question posed by Morgan Stanley, which concludes any impact would be mostly be felt in metallurgical coal prices. Commodities strategist Helen Amos says China accounts for a relatively small share of U.S. coal exports. Still, U.S. exports of thermal and metallurgical coal to China increased over 2024. Morgan Stanley estimates tariffs would raise costs for around 3.4 million tons of thermal coal, representing less than 1% of traded volumes, and around 10.7 million tons of metallurgical coal, or some 3% of traded volumes. \"We see negligible or only modest potential price impact of China's coal import tariffs, given both coal markets are currently well supplied,\" Morgan Stanley says. \"But we watch for more meaningful shifts in met coal trade flows.\" (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">NEW YORK, Feb.  04, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Veea Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ: VEEA), a pioneer in edge computing and AI-driven solutions, today issued a Letter to Shareholders from Founder and Chief Executive Officer Allen Salmasi.</p><p class=\"\">Dear Fellow Shareholders,</p><p class=\"\">On the occasion of Veea ringing the Nasdaq Opening Bell on February 5, I want to welcome our shareholders and share our insights with respect to our vision, strategy, and the opportunities that lie ahead.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Connecting the World at the Edge</strong>I am thrilled to share with you that a monumental shift in technology has occurred, one that now directly aligns with our vision of the future dating back to the founding of the company ten years ago. This transformation is the convergence of Edge Computing, Hyperconverged Networks, and the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the very edge that all things connect to the network, commonly referred to as Edge AI.</p><p class=\"\">We have developed a portfolio of fully integrated, scalable, and turnkey wireless and wired communications and computing devices and services - VeeaHub products, VeeaWare, and VeeaCloud – that deliver cloud-to-edge solutions and allow businesses to manage high volumes of data to enable real-time applications and maintain system reliability. Our solutions have been iterated over the last several years to minimize production costs, reduce installation expenses, and deliver scalability with easy integration to third party solutions, resulting in a lower total cost of ownership compared to typical edge computing solutions.</p><p class=\"\">We possess more than 100 exclusively-owned patents covering 26 patent families, and a significant partner ecosystem. Our products have been deployed to enterprises and SMB/SMEs across several countries, providing real-world solutions across various end markets. We are transforming lives from remote villages in Indonesia, where Veea’s mesh network is empowering internet connectivity in health, education, and agriculture, to retailers in Mexico, farms in North America, a campus in Hong Kong, and a 21-acre commercial building complex in Orlando, Florida where our Veea Edge Platform is enabling common indoor and outdoor common area Wi-Fi.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Well Positioned to Support the 5</strong><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">th</strong><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"> Industrial Revolution</strong>Significant advances in AI technologies are now driving the 5th Industrial Revolution, fundamentally reshaping how we live, work, and interact. Unlike previous industrial revolutions driven by mechanization, electricity, computing, and automation, the 5th Industrial Revolution is characterized by the seamless integration of AI and human intelligence to enhance decision-making, improve productivity, and drive innovation across every sector. This is not just a technological trend; it is a pivotal force shaping the future of industries, economies, and our organization.</p><p class=\"\">AI inferencing is at the heart of this revolution, driving a new business paradigm that demands a fresh approach to technology infrastructure and service delivery. AI inferencing refers to the process where a trained AI model applies its learned knowledge to analyze new, unseen data and generate predictions or decisions based on the patterns it has identified during training; essentially, it's the \"action\" of using an AI model to make sense of “new information” and draw conclusions from it. For many enterprise and consumer use cases massive amounts of data must be collected and processed at the edge. Among many of its utilities, this is what Veea Edge Platform does most efficiently.</p><p class=\"\">Veea’s unique implementation of Edge AI brings the power of AI closer to where data is generated—at the “edge” of networks. This means faster decision-making, reduced latency, enhanced security, increased reliability, data privacy and sovereignty, and real-time insights without the dependency on centralized cloud infrastructure. Edge Computing complements this by processing data locally, significantly improving efficiency and reducing bandwidth costs.</p><p class=\"\">Edge Computing is not just a supporting technology—it is the core capability that enables AI inferencing to deliver real-time, context-aware insights to both enterprises and consumers alike. By processing data closer to the source, Edge Computing ensures that AI applications are responsive, resilient, and efficient. This shift requires businesses to adopt new operational models, emphasizing agility, scalability, and decentralized intelligence.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS)</strong>At Veea, we are at the forefront of this transformation, leveraging Edge Computing to power our AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) offerings. Traditional business models are no longer sufficient to support the speed, scale, and complexity required by broadly adopted AI-driven applications. Some believe that AI Agents will eventually replace SaaS solutions.</p><p class=\"\">Hyperconverged Networking (HCN) is the backbone that supports this rapid data processing and AI-driven environment. By integrating computing, storage, and networking into a unified system, HCN enhances scalability, simplifies IT infrastructure, and ensures robust data flow between edge devices and core systems. Veea’s virtualized software environment, supporting cloud-native applications, together with one of the most advanced HCN implementations, positions us very well to lead in the delivery of highly optimized solutions in this new era, creating unparalleled value for our customers and sustainable growth for our shareholders.</p><p class=\"\">Through the seamless integration of Edge AI, Edge Computing, and Hyperconverged Networking, all supported by Veea’s cloud-managed products, we are driving:</p><p class=\"\">- Innovation: Delivering cutting-edge products and services that meet the demands of the widest range of the rapidly evolving digital landscape.</p><p class=\"\">- Operational Efficiency: Reducing costs and improving performance for many industries.</p><p class=\"\">- Growth Opportunities: Expanding into new markets and sectors that are rapidly adopting AI inferencing and edge technologies.</p><p class=\"\">- Shareholder Value: Enhancing our competitive advantage, creating revenue streams, and supporting long-term financial performance.</p><p class=\"\">A Unique Business Model Supported by Technology that Delivers Solutions <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">to Real World Problems</strong>What sets Veea apart in this transformative era is our unique business model as a Managed Service Provider (MSP) that is delivering solutions such i) as 5G fixed wireless access through our VeeaHub edge computing products with AI-driven cybersecurity, and a range of value-added services currently being rolled-out by network operators to SMBs and SME, as one of its highly scalable use cases, and ii) Edge AI inferencing through our innovative AIaaS offering with complete turnkey hardware and software solutions (i.e., full stack). This model allows us to deliver AI-powered applications and insights at scale without requiring the end-users to invest heavily in infrastructure or specialized talent.</p><p class=\"\">Through our AIaaS platform, we provide end-to-end management of AI workloads, from deployment and optimization to continuous monitoring and maintenance. This approach offers several key differentiators:</p><p class=\"\">- Scalability: Clients can easily scale their AI capabilities as their business grows, without the complexities of managing hardware and software.</p><p class=\"\">- Cost Efficiency: By offering AI on a subscription basis, we lower the barriers to entry, making advanced AI accessible to organizations of all sizes.</p><p class=\"\">- Agility: Our managed services enable rapid deployment and iteration, allowing businesses to adapt quickly to changing market demands.</p><p class=\"\">- Expertise: Clients benefit from our deep expertise in AI, edge computing, and hyperconverged networking, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.</p><p class=\"\">AI inferencing supported by Edge AI represents a compelling business model and a significant growth opportunity for several reasons:</p><p class=\"\">- Explosive Market Demand: The global demand for real-time, data-driven decision-making is rising across industries including retail, healthcare, manufacturing, smart buildings, smart cities, and smart farming. Organizations need solutions that process data instantly, making Edge AI inferencing critical.</p><p class=\"\">- Recurring Revenue Streams: The MSP and AIaaS business models enable predictable, recurring revenue through subscription-based offerings.

The Chinese tariff on $5 billion of U.S. energy imports suggests a \"softer tone of the response\" to the U.S. tariffs, Alex Hodes of StoneX says in a note. \"The tariffs are also not expected to come into play until Feb. 10, leaving room for negotiations between the two nations.\" (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1506 ET - U.S. natural gas futures lose ground, but end above the day's lows as weather forecasts shift between colder and milder. The impact of China's decision to slap a 15% retaliatory tariff on imports of U.S. LNG is difficult to gauge, forecaster NatGasWeather.com says in a note. \"Weather trends the next few days will continue to be very important and are likely to dictate the direction of trade.\" The Nymex front month settles down 3% at $3.253/mmBtu. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0936 ET - U.S. natural gas futures hand back some of the previous day's gains as weather forecasts continue to vary over how cold February is likely to be. China announced a 15% tariff to be placed on imports of U.S. LNG as of Feb. 10, in response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. \"In the immediate term, Chinese offtakers may shy away from U.S.-sourced spot LNG purchases--but U.S. LNG may simply backfill other Asian supply that China lifts instead,\" Eli Rubin of EBW Analytics says in a note. The tariffs could affect longer-term contracting, however, he adds. The Nymex front month is down 5.2% at $3.177/mmBtu.

Brent crude is down 2.3% to $74.22 a barrel, while WTI falls 3.3% to $70.75 a barrel. Both benchmarks erased all the previous session's gains, also due to easing concerns over immediate disruption of Canadian and Mexican oil flows after U.S. President Trump agreed to hold off imposing tariffs on the two neighboring countries. \"The next key support levels to watch are $69.50 and $66,\" says Razan Hilal, market analyst at Forex. \"A deeper decline could signal the start of a more extended bearish trend.\" (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0910 ET - Oil futures are lower as China retaliates against U.S. tariffs with duties on U.S. exports including oil and LNG, to take effect Feb. 10. The tariff is particularly negative for WTI, says TP ICAP's Scott Shelton in a note. \"I would assume with a $7 tax roughly, that arb is firmly shut and WTI will have to go elsewhere in the next few months as we go into turnarounds.\" U.S. refineries reduce their crude use during the maintenance season, leading to builds in U.S. crude stocks. WTI is down 2.7% at $71.16 a barrel. Brent is 1.8% lower at $74.61 a barrel. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0745 ET - China's counter tariffs on U.S. imports aren't expected to have a significant impact on the oil market, according to Commerzbank Research. Beijing said it would impose a 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas products as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil and other products such as agricultural machinery, effective on Feb. 10. \"As China only sourced 1.8% of its crude oil imports from the U.S. last year, the impact on the oil market should be limited,\" commodity analyst Carsten Fritsch says in a note. (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0620 ET - Machinery cyclical stock would be the most affected by U.S tariffs in the capital-goods sector, Deutsche Bank Research analyst Gael de-Bray says in a research note. Most industrial companies that have reported so far beat expectations on orders and revenue. The downturn in manufacturing activity that began in 2022 was just starting to show signs of easing, de-Bray says. However, the uncertainty, extra costs and inflation brought forth by new U.S tariffs could derail this nascent industrial recovery, the analyst says. With the risk of a global recession rising, Swedish SKF and Sandvik are likely first in line to feel the impact.

However, \"we still see that the market expects significant LNG volumes to reach the market in 2026, pushing the price down.\" The EU needs more LNG to meet its storage-filling target of 90% by Nov. 1., but inventories have been depleting fast and the bloc barely reached the Feb. 1 target of 50%. As of Sunday, EU gas storage was 52.6% full, with particularly high daily net withdrawals in Germany due to low wind-power generation. (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0359 ET - Oil prices fall more than 1% as immediate concerns over supply disruptions ease after U.S. President Trump paused tariffs on Mexico and Canada, the country's biggest foreign suppliers of crude. Brent is down 1.3% at $74.95 a barrel, while WTI falls 2% to $71.70 a barrel. Meanwhile, as a 10% U.S. tariff on Chinese imports came into effect Tuesday, Beijing announced its decision to retaliate with a 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas imports and a 10% levy on American crude oil and agricultural machinery, starting Monday. The move raised fears of a trade war that could ultimately hurt global growth and dampen demand, putting further pressure on prices. (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0321 ET - OMV delivered positive fourth-quarter results underlined by a better-than-expected dividend per share of 4.75 euros, Jefferies analysts Giacomo Romeo and Kai Ye Loh write. The Austrian oil and gas company's net income exceeded expectations by 14% due to a lower-than-expected tax rate and net financial result, they write. Despite reporting profit in-line with expectations, quarterly cash-flow generation was 10% lower than expected, they add. The company's 2025 guidance is now for lower-than-expected capital expenditure of 3.5 billion euros and weak production of 300,000 barrels of oil-equivalent a day, the analysts write. Shares fall 0.9% to 38.84 euros. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
