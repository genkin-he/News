            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Miles Kruppa</p><p class=\"\">Google recorded a slowdown in revenue growth in its most recent quarter, sending its shares tumbling in after-hours trading.</p><p class=\"\">Parent company Alphabet reported $96.5 billion of revenue for the three months ending December, an increase of 12% from the same period a year earlier. Alphabet hasn't reported a growth rate that low since 2023.</p><p class=\"\">Shares in Alphabet were down 7% in after-hours trading following the earnings report, paring much of this year's gains of about 8%.</p><p class=\"\">Alphabet reported $26.6 billion of net income for the quarter, an increase of 28.3% from a year earlier.</p><p class=\"\">Large tech companies have been facing questions about their outsize spending on artificial intelligence after Chinese startup DeepSeek stunned Silicon Valley with powerful models built more cheaply than their American equivalents. Its chatbot app rocketed to the top of app store rankings, ahead of ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.</p><p class=\"\">But Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said Google was accelerating its investments in the data centers that power AI, both for his company and clients of its cloud-computing business. Pichai said Google would spend about $75 billion on capital expenditures this year, compared with $52.5 billion in 2024.</p><p class=\"\">Google's cloud-computing division underperformed Wall Street analysts' expectations last quarter, reporting $12 billion in fourth-quarter sales. That represented a growth rate of 30.1% from the same period a year earlier, a notable slowdown from the prior quarter.</p><p class=\"\">Executives have been hoping the cloud division's strength can help make up for slowing growth in Google's core advertising business. Competitors including Amazon and TikTok have been eating into Google's dominance in search advertising.</p><p class=\"\">Google was hit this week with  an antitrust investigation in China in retaliation for new tariffs President Trump imposed on goods from that country. China's antitrust regulator didn't provide any details about the probe, and Google declined to comment.</p><p class=\"\">In the U.S., Google is preparing to defend against a breakup the federal government is seeking of the company after a judge found it  has a monopoly in online search. Separately, a judge is expected to rule soon in  another antitrust lawsuit targeting Google's role facilitating ads on third-party websites.</p><p class=\"\">OpenAI has recently taken aim at Google's namesake search engine, giving ChatGPT the ability to search the web to answer questions. It released a feature called Deep Research this week that compiles in-depth reports using information from the web, mimicking a feature with the same name already available in Gemini .</p><p class=\"\">Pichai has set a goal of  reaching 500 million users for its Gemini chatbot by the end of the year. The company has been playing catch up to OpenAI since the startup released ChatGPT in late 2022.</p><p class=\"\">Google has been looking for ways to cut costs. It began offering voluntary buyouts last month to employees working on its Pixel devices and Android mobile software following a merger of the two groups under one leader last year.</p><p class=\"\">\"There's tremendous momentum on this team and with so much important work ahead, we want everyone to be deeply committed to our mission and focused on building great products, with speed and efficiency,\" a Google spokeswoman said.</p><p class=\"\">Google recently removed language from its website pledging to not build AI for weapons and \"other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people,\" according to screenshots viewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p class=\"\">It also removed a section forbidding \"technologies that cause or are likely to cause overall harm.\"</p><p class=\"\">Google executives wrote in a blog post published Tuesday that \"companies, governments, and organizations sharing these values should work together to create AI that protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security.\"</p><p class=\"\">Write to Miles Kruppa at miles.kruppa@wsj.com</p></span></div>",
