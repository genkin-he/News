This is in line with our long-term goals of helping more people with disabilities to communicate, while generating good revenue growth and steadily improving operating margins. Both the short-term and long-term potential continue to be substantial, given the low global penetration of assistive communication solutions. By investing in raising awareness of assistive communication, we can positively impact future growth and our community</p><p class=\"\">Sales growth in local currencies was 22% for the quarter. Our September product launches continued to generate a highly favorable response in the market, with the bulk of orders, originally slated for recognition as revenue in the third quarter, delivered before the close of the year. The fourth quarter is historically our strongest from a seasonal perspective and this pattern was also evident in 2024. Revenue grew by 23% in local currency over the full year 2024.</p><p class=\"\">During the quarter, we saw strong growth across all regions and user categories, along with a solid increase in new prescriptions. The fastest-growing user group continues to be those utilizing our symbol-based touch solutions, particularly children and young people with autism.</p><p class=\"\">We continue to invest in sales capacity and internal systems to further enhance the scalability of our business. The performance trend shows that these efforts are delivering results. Operating profit grew by almost 50% and the operating margin increased 2.3 percentage points year-on-year to 14.2%. Ongoing growth consistent with our goals, combined with the advantages of scale, positions us well to improve our operating margin toward our long-term goal of achieving and exceeding 15% on an annual basis.</p><p class=\"\">The consolidation of our product development organization, announced in November, is progressing according to plan. By focusing these efforts at our Stockholm headquarters, we enhance our innovation capacity while also improving our ability to provide hardware and software that are more seamlessly integrated and better aligned with the entire customer journey. Creating a centralized hub for product development enables us to drive market penetration and strategic innovation, while also more effectively enhancing customer value.</p><p class=\"\">In early October we finalized the acquisition of Link Assistive, our reseller partner in Australia and New Zealand. Hereby we transform these markets to fully align with our organization, enabling us to better assist individuals with disabilities in achieving effective communication. Acquisitions are a key component of our strategy for profitable growth, especially as a means of achieving forward integration in the value chain and building closer customer relationships in each local market. Purchasing established reseller partners has clearly proven to be a winning formula for taking a successful local market to the next level.</p><p class=\"\">We are closely monitoring the announced policy changes in our largest individual market, the US. The situation is expected to continue to be fluid. However, at this point we have no indications of any material impact on results, either negative or positive.</p><p class=\"\">Overall, we look to the future with confidence. Only a fraction of people who need assistive communication solutions are aware of or have access to information about the solutions offered by us or our industry peers. We are firmly committed to improving this situation, which also represents significant potential for our long-term growth and enables us to make a difference for an increasing number of individuals.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><em><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Fredrik Ruben, CEO</strong></em></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Webcast:</strong></p><p class=\"\">Today at 9:00 a.m. CET, Dynavox Group will host a webcast presentation for media, analysts and investors.

These include the completion of the CEM III shotcrete development for Outokumpu, the approval by the Concrete Association and the achievement of CE marking readiness for the world's lowest carbon cavity tiles developed by Betolar for Consolis Parma. In addition, new Betolar innovations for which patents have been filed, such as the use of various sidestreams and inventions for metal fractioning, were significant achievements in addition to product development breakthroughs, such as passing the challenging double-sided salt freeze thaw tests for concrete products.</p><p class=\"\">On the mining side, the market showed strong interest in Betolar's low-carbon and waste-free solutions. We started commercial discussions with a number of different mining companies in the second half of the year and signed several memoranda of understanding with companies such as Norge Minerals and Latitude 66 Ltd. This shows that there is significant demand in the mining sector for Betolar's new innovative and low-carbon solutions.</p><p class=\"\">The market situation, particularly in the construction sector, continued to be challenging.  Although several successful customer pilot projects were completed, many players in the sector took a time-out in bringing low-carbon products to market. However, interest in low-carbon concrete products remained high.  </p><p class=\"\">2024 was a year of significant change for Betolar. The company's strategy was refocused on the mining, metals and sidestream business segments. This led to a major organizational change and the start of change negotiations for the Finnish workforce in late spring. There were also personnel changes in the company's management and the size of the management team was reduced from seven to three people. Change is always a challenge and requires stretching and commitment from the whole organization. Towards the end of the year, however, these changes started to produce the desired results.</p><p class=\"\">I want to thank all Betolar staff for their excellent work towards new innovations and a low-carbon future. I also thank all our customers, partners and stakeholders for their trust and good cooperation.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Key figures</strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Key indicators for the Group</strong></p><div class=\"tableWrapper-pIO_GYwT\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td>(EUR thousand, unless otherwise specified)</td><td>10-12/2024</td><td>10-12/2023</td><td>7-12/2024</td><td>7-12/2023</td><td>2024</td><td>2023</td></tr><tr><td>Financial indicators</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Net sales</td><td>210</td><td>217</td><td>486</td><td>385</td><td>762</td><td>515</td></tr><tr><td>Gross margin1</td><td></td><td></td><td>347</td><td>304</td><td>564</td><td>340</td></tr><tr><td>EBITDA1,2</td><td>-1,193</td><td>-2,370</td><td>-2,167</td><td>-4,995</td><td>-5,816</td><td>-11,181</td></tr><tr><td>Operating profit</td><td></td><td></td><td>-3,299</td><td>-6,185</td><td>-7,964</td><td>-13,260</td></tr><tr><td>Earnings before interest and taxes</td><td></td><td></td><td>-3,228</td><td>-6,126</td><td>-7,798</td><td>-13,177</td></tr><tr><td>Profit (loss) for the financial period</td><td></td><td></td><td>-3,198</td><td>-6,122</td><td>-7,732</td><td>-13,153</td></tr><tr><td>Earnings per share, basic and diluted, EUR1,2,3</td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.15</td><td>-0.31</td><td>-0.36</td><td>-0.67</td></tr><tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents and short-term fund investments1,2 (at the end of the period)</td><td>8,987</td><td>14,315</td><td>8,987</td><td>14,315</td><td>8,987</td><td>14,315</td></tr><tr><td>Operational indicators</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Order intake (EUR thousand) 1,2</td><td>271</td><td>213</td><td>508</td><td>469</td><td>1,003</td><td>607</td></tr><tr><td>Number of new NRE projects1,2</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>11</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Number of pilot customers1,2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Personnel (average number during the financial period)</td><td>37</td><td>57</td><td>40</td><td>58</td><td>46</td><td>60</td></tr></tbody></table></div><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Betolar uses certain indicators (gross margin, EBITDA, earnings per share, cash and cash equivalents and short-term fund investments, order intake, number of new NRE projects and number of pilot customers) as half-yearly indicators of operational profitability and business performance.

Our strategic focus in recent years – prioritizing growth, optimizing our footprint, and enhancing operational efficiency – have resulted in strong overall performance. Continued good demand and successful acquisitions led to an 11 percent increase in net sales for the year. Revenues reached a record high in 2024, marking our best-ever full-year performance with an adjusted EBITA margin of 15.1 percent.</p><p class=\"\">Driven by higher profits and positive development of working capital, cash flow from operating activities improved. We continue to prioritize efforts to strengthen our financial resilience through enhanced cash flow management and reductions in working capital. Leverage increased slightly during the year, primarily driven by our active M&amp;A strategy, including both acquisitions and minority investments. In AirTech, we acquired Airprotech, an Italian manufacturer of systems to abate volatile organic compounds. In DCT, we acquired Geoclima, an Italian manufacturer of air- and water-cooled chillers. In FoodTech, we made two controller related acquisitions: Automated Environments, a US-based company specializing in automated control systems for the layer industry, and Hotraco, a Dutch developer of control systems and sensors for the agricultural sector. The acquisitions in FoodTech highlight our strategic focus on growing the digital business through software, controllers, sensors and IoT in this business area going forward.</p><p class=\"\">Mixed fourth quarter: Positive sales and stable margin despite weakened demand</p><p class=\"\">Order intake was mixed in the fourth quarter. Overall order intake declined, except for FoodTech, which saw growth. DCTs order intake declined as the same quarter last year included large orders of approximately BSEK 2.2. However, the underlying demand for our cooling solutions within DCT remains strong across key markets, as evidenced by a 60 percent organic increase in small and medium-sized orders in the quarter. In AirTech order intake declined, mainly due to a continued weak battery sub-segment across all regions. All business areas contributed to the net sales growth of 19 percent, especially DCT and FoodTech. In FoodTech the SaaS revenue (ARR) in Digital solutions grew by 46 percent in the quarter. The adjusted EBITA-margin was at the same level as last year, supported by strong improvements in DCT and FoodTech. However, lower demand from the battery sub-segment resulted in under-absorption, adversely impacting AirTechs margin. This corresponded to a negative effect on AirTechs adjusted EBITA-margin of approximately -3 percent in the quarter.</p><p class=\"\">We expect the weakness in the battery market to remain throughout 2025. In light of this, and the development in 2024, AirTech has identified and implemented various measures to strengthen the margin going forward. We anticipate that this will mitigate the weaknesses and strengthen AirTechs profitability from current levels during the second half of 2025. We will continue to monitor this situation closely, taking further measures if needed.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Investing to stay ahead of the curve</strong></p><p class=\"\">We continue to drive an ambitious growth agenda based on our firm belief in the long-term growth opportunities relating to megatrends such as electrification and digitalization. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on strategic acquisitions to expand our technology and market reach while prioritizing investments in innovation and operational efficiency. With our strong market position and innovative solutions, we are confident in our ability to seize future growth opportunities. To support our growth journey, we are excited to expand operations with two new state-of-the-art factories in 2025 – one in Cork, Ireland for DCT and another in Amesbury, US for AirTech. These expansions will enhance our global reach, increase production capacity, improve workflows and better serve the growing needs of our customers worldwide while prioritizing energy efficiency and resource conservation. The Cork facility, which opened at the end of 2024, will ramp up production throughout 2025, while the Amesbury facility is set to open in the first half of the year. During the transition, both existing and new sites will operate in parallel at the beginning of 2025.</p><p class=\"\">With a clear strategy, strategic investments, and a commitment to innovation, we are well-positioned to drive sustainable growth and create lasting value for our customers, partners, and stakeholders.</p><p class=\"\">Klas Forsström, President &amp; CEO</p><p class=\"\">Information about the webcast and telephone conference</p><p class=\"\">Welcome to join a webcast or telephone conference today, February 5, at 9:00 CET, when CEO Klas Forsström together with the CFO, Katharina Fischer, will present the report.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Webcast:</strong> https://ir.financialhearings.com/munters-q4-report-2024</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Conference call:</strong> If you wish to participate via teleconference, please register on the link below.

We achieved all-time highs in order intake, absolute operating result and cash flow from operating activities. During 2024, we also significantly enhanced the profitability of all businesses. Furthermore, our order book is at an all-time high, positioning us well for future success as we move into 2025. Our strategy, the Wärtsilä Way, is yielding results.</p><p class=\"\">The market environment for our businesses remained relatively stable throughout 2024. However, as the year progressed, geopolitical tensions clearly increased, introducing uncertainty to the macroeconomic outlook due to heightened risks of protectionism and trade policy uncertainty. Despite these challenges, our customers in the marine and energy industries remained increasingly focused on decarbonisation.</p><p class=\"\">In the energy market, the transition towards renewables continued to advance. Wind and solar are expected to post record installations in 2024 and 2025, driven not only by climate concerns but also by affordability. The demand for balancing technologies is closely linked to the increasing share of intermittent renewables in the energy system. Renewable-led power systems require flexibility in various forms: balancing power plants, alongside battery energy storage, are critical to reaching global climate goals. In 2024 both thermal balancing and battery energy storage experienced their highest levels of market activity to date.</p><p class=\"\">In the marine market, the growth in global trade volumes combined with a shift in trade flows resulted in a significant boost to demand for ship capacity in 2024. This, coupled with a growing pressure to decarbonise operations, supported the demand for both newbuilds and service. Investments in new ships were clearly above the levels seen in 2023, and we saw a healthy pickup in interest towards alternative fuels, which now accounted for 49% of the capacity of contracted vessels. Despite the efforts to increase shipyard capacity and output especially in China but also in South Korea, shipyard capacity utilisation rates remain high and shipyard orderbooks remain long, indicating that a shortage of yard capacity still exists.</p><p class=\"\">In both the marine and energy markets, Wärtsilä made significant progress in capturing the opportunities offered by the decarbonisation transition and we strengthened our position as a leader in innovation with a number of world firsts. These included our launch of the first ever large-scale, 100% hydrogen-ready engine power plant, representing a breakthrough on the path towards net-zero power systems of the future. We also announced a deal to supply our pioneering engine technology for what is due to become the world’s first ammonia-fuelled in-service supply vessel, a landmark in the marine industry’s transition to sustainable fuels. In 2024, service represented 53% of our net sales and continued to be a major driver for customer satisfaction and profitable growth. We saw good success in moving our customers up the service value ladder. The renewal rate of our service agreements is more than 90%, which is a proof point of the value that our lifecycle agreements are creating for our customers.</p><p class=\"\">In 2024 Wärtsilä’s order intake increased organically by 17%. Service order intake increased, driven primarily by growth in Marine. Equipment order intake increased supported by higher activity in all businesses. Net sales increased organically by 9%, with clear growth in both service and equipment.</p><p class=\"\">The comparable operating result increased by 39% to EUR 694 million, which represents 10.8% of net sales. Comparable operating result increased in all businesses. Cash flow from operating activities ended strong and totalled EUR 1,208 million in 2024, supported by the better result and improved working capital. It is important to note that the current negative working capital levels are unusual for our business, and we expect them to normalise going forward. Still, our active work on all elements of working capital has continued and has supported us in keeping working capital at a clearly lower level than the long-term historical average.</p><p class=\"\">In 2024 we actively managed our business portfolio with the goal of becoming a more focused and profitable company. In December, we advanced further towards this goal by announcing the agreement to divest our Automation, Navigation and Control System (ANCS) business. Subject to approvals, the transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2025.</p><p class=\"\">In late 2023, we announced a strategic review of Energy Storage &amp; Optimisation to accelerate its profitable growth in a way that benefits customers, employees, and value creation for Wärtsilä shareholders. This review is still ongoing. We continue to develop and invest in the Energy Storage &amp; Optimisation business during the strategic review, and we remain fully committed to serving our customers.</p><p class=\"\">While the outlook for both of our end markets remains positive going into 2025, the current geopolitical tensions and trade policy uncertainty may especially impact our Energy business. We expect the demand environment for the coming 12 months to be better than the comparison period in both Marine and Energy, but we also underline that the current high external uncertainties make forward looking statements more challenging.</p><p class=\"\">In 2024 we celebrated Wärtsilä’s 190-year anniversary. From our humble beginnings as a village sawmill in eastern Finland, we are now making an important contribution to the world’s decarbonisation transformation. During these two centuries our company has repeatedly transformed itself and shaped the industries we have operated in, underpinned at all times by two elements: our focus on innovation and our commitment to our customers. Our progress today shows that these principles are still very much thriving.</p><p class=\"\">Wärtsilä can make a difference to the world and we can secure our financial performance and deliver attractive long-term shareholder value. I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to our customers and partners, our engaged and committed Wärtsilä team, and our shareholders for your trust in Wärtsilä’s future success. I look forward to continuing on this exciting journey together.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">KEY FIGURES</strong></p><div class=\"tableWrapper-pIO_GYwT\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td>MEUR</td><td>10–12/2024</td><td>10–12/2023</td><td>Change</td><td>1–12/2024</td><td>1–12/2023</td><td>Change</td></tr><tr><td>Order intake</td><td>2,491</td><td>1,856</td><td>34%</td><td>8,072</td><td>7,070</td><td>14%</td></tr><tr><td>of which services</td><td>1,007</td><td>876</td><td>15%</td><td>3,812</td><td>3,519</td><td>8%</td></tr><tr><td>of which equipment</td><td>1,484</td><td>980</td><td>51%</td><td>4,260</td><td>3,550</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>Order book, end of period</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>8,366</td><td>6,694</td><td>25%</td></tr><tr><td>Net sales</td><td>1,854</td><td>1,644</td><td>13%</td><td>6,449</td><td>6,015</td><td>7%</td></tr><tr><td>of which services</td><td>948</td><td>843</td><td>12%</td><td>3,422</td><td>3,148</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>of which equipment</td><td>905</td><td>800</td><td>13%</td><td>3,027</td><td>2,867</td><td>6%</td></tr><tr><td>Book-to-bill</td><td>1.34</td><td>1.13</td><td></td><td>1.25</td><td>1.18</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Comparable adjusted EBITA*</td><td>214</td><td>182</td><td>18%</td><td>712</td><td>518</td><td>38%</td></tr><tr><td>% of net sales</td><td>11.5</td><td>11.1</td><td></td><td>11.0</td><td>8.6</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Comparable operating result</td><td>209</td><td>177</td><td>18%</td><td>694</td><td>497</td><td>39%</td></tr><tr><td>% of net sales</td><td>11.3</td><td>10.8</td><td></td><td>10.8</td><td>8.3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Operating result</td><td>229</td><td>128</td><td>80%</td><td>716</td><td>402</td><td>78%</td></tr><tr><td>% of net sales</td><td>12.4</td><td>7.8</td><td></td><td>11.1</td><td>6.7</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Result before taxes</td><td>219</td><td>120</td><td>82%</td><td>687</td><td>364</td><td>89%</td></tr><tr><td>Earnings per share (EPS), basic and diluted, EUR</td><td>0.27</td><td>0.16</td><td></td><td>0.85</td><td>0.44</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cash flow from operating activities</td><td>437</td><td>389</td><td></td><td>1,208</td><td>822</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Net interest-bearing debt, end of period</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>-777</td><td>35</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gearing</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.31</td><td>0.02</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Solvency, %</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>37.4</td><td>37.0</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"7\">*Comparable adjusted EBITA excludes items affecting comparability and purchase price allocation amortisation.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"\">Wärtsilä presents certain alternative performance measures in accordance with the guidance issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).

EBITDA decreased to DKK 5,146 million (+7% CER; -1% DKK), impacted by the transaction and integration costs amounting to DKK 420 million of Longboard as well as an impairment loss of DKK 547 million from one of the MAGLi projects affecting R&amp;D costs, while 2023 included a Vyepti® obsolescence provision.</p><p class=\"\">For 2025, revenue growth is expected to be +7% to +10% at CER when compared to revenue of the prior year. The growth reflects especially the strong contribution from Vyepti, Rexulti in the U.S. and Brintellix in Europe. Lundbeck expects adjusted EBITDA growth to be 5% to 11% at CER when compared to adjusted EBITDA of the prior year, driven by the growth in revenue, partially offset by higher R&amp;D investments. The significant increase in R&amp;D costs driven by the phase III investment for bexicaserin and the further maturing of Lundbeck’s R&amp;D pipeline are fully absorbed by disciplined capital reallocation initiatives.</p><p class=\"\">In line with our dividend policy, it is proposed to pay-out a dividend of DKK 0.95 per share or DKK 946 million which is an increase of +36% compared to 2023.</p><p class=\"\">Lundbeck’s President and CEO, Charl van Zyl said:</p><p class=\"\">“<!-- -->I am very pleased to present a strong performance for 2024, with record revenue driven by accelerated growth in all strategic brands and with a strong outlook into 2025.

Bexicaserin achieved an overall median seizure reduction of 59.3 percent in countable motor seizures over a 12-month open-label extension (OLE) treatment period.

The FDA’s decision to host a PDAC meeting does not reflect a final decision on the approvability. A final date for the meeting has yet to be set by the FDA, but it is currently anticipated to occur during the first half of 2025.

The acquisition of Longboard marks a strategic milestone for Lundbeck, enhancing and complementing our Focused Innovator strategy and advancing our goal of building a neuro-rare disease franchise.</p><p class=\"\">On 27 November 2024, Lundbeck announced the advancement of the clinical development of amlenetug (Lu AF82422) for the treatment of Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) with the initiation of <em>MASCOT</em>, a randomized, double-blind, phase III trial.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Gold is mounting a notable bullish rally, fueled by market uncertainty, says Ahmad Assiri, research strategist at Pepperstone. Trade tensions following the U.S.'s imposition of a 10% tariff on Chinese imports, and delayed but looming tariffs on Canadian and Mexican products, have fueled a shift toward safe haven assets, he writes in a note. Although the USD index initially strengthened earlier in the week, posing a headwind for gold, its retracement helped revive buying interest in the precious metal. From a technical perspective, gold is testing resistance that could trigger some profit-taking but the broader trend remains supported by hedging activities amid an uncertainty, Assiri adds. He sees scope for new record peaks if the risk landscape persists. Gold has hit a series of record highs in recent days and was last around $2,857/oz. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
