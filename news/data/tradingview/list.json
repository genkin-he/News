            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">0730 GMT - Limiting the downside risks for Chinese markets and the yuan depend on the potential of fresh talks between the U.S. and China, writes Mansoor Mohi-uddin, chief economist at Bank of Singapore. Financial markets on Tuesday had a muted reaction to China's retaliatory tariffs of 10%-15% on select U.S. goods, but there's a chance of a stronger reaction down the line if negotiations don't see results, Mohi-uddin says. Should U.S. tariffs on China remain at 10% this year, the impact should be manageable, he notes, adding that the measures will trim about 0.5% from China's GDP growth this year from its 5.0% rate in 2024. However, should the tariffs be raised to 20%-30%, growth may fall closer to 4.0%, Mohi-uddin estimates. (kimberley.kao@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0725 GMT - Japanese stocks ended higher, led by auto stocks, as fears about U.S. tariffs subside. Toyota Motor gained 3.1% after it raised earnings projections and reported third-quarter results. Meanwhile, Honda Motor climbed 8.2% following news that Nissan's board is planning to reject Honda's terms for a combination of the two automakers. Nissan Motor fell 4.9%. The Nikkei Stock Average rose 0.1% to 38831.48. Investors are focusing on U.S. tariff-related developments as well as earnings. USD/JPY is at 153.16, compared with 154.34 as of Tuesday 5 p.m. Eastern time. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield rises one basis point to 1.285%. (kosaku.narioka@wsj.com; @kosakunarioka)</p><p class=\"\">0717 GMT - The yuan may still face more downward pressure, Maybank's FX analysts say in a research report. \"China remains the only country that President Trump has allowed tariff to take effect on,\" the analysts say. \"Notwithstanding the fact that his trade policies and end goals remain murky at this stage, the developments thus far suggest that China is still taking the brunt of his trade policies,\" the analysts say. Taking into account the tariffs' deadlines, a scenario of an impasse on U.S.-China negotiations would probably prompt the PBOC to \"relent\" on USD/CNY fixings and allow USD/CNY to trend higher, the analysts add. USD/CNH is little changed at 7.2861. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0714 GMT - The impact of Trump's 10% tariff on Chinese exports on China's GDP growth this year looks manageable, Bank of Singapore chief economist Mansoor Mohi-uddin writes in a note. If the 10% levy is maintained for the rest of 2025, that would shave around 0.5% off China's GDP growth, he says. But if tariffs are raised to 20% to 30%, that would likely drag China's economic growth this year to 4.0% from 5.0% last year, he adds. That said, Beijing's retaliation, with targeted tariffs aimed at U.S. exports amounting to only $14 billion, leaves the door open for a potential deal with Washington to avert a broader trade war, he adds. (jiahui.huang@wsj.com; @ivy_jiahuihuang)</p><p class=\"\">0704 GMT - The 'tariff can' has just been kicked down the road, with the idea of imposing levies on U.S. imports from its two closest neighbours still not off the table entirely, says Pepperstone's Michael Brown. \"In fact, this whole saga could well rumble on until the start of April, when the review ordered by President Trump into U.S. trade policy is due to report back,\" the senior research strategist says in a note. Trump agreed to postpone the tariffs on Mexico and Canada for a month after talks with the leaders of both countries. \"Perhaps, it is at that point, that we will see tariffs shift from being used as a bargaining chip to further certain political aims, to actually being used as a measure to address trade imbalances,\" Brown says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0659 GMT - Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have dodged tariff bullets for now, but they shouldn't get too comfortable, Moody's Analytics economists say. The three appear obvious targets given their hefty trade surpluses with the U.S. One possible reason is security ties with the U.S. Another is the fact that Japan is among the U.S.'s biggest foreign investors. Korean and Taiwanese firms have been ramping up investment too. That's come at China's expense, aligning with the U.S. bid to curb its influence in supply chains, they add. But the mood could shift and tariffs could come. The economies also face collateral damage. Carmakers like Toyota and Kia have plants in Mexico, and Taiwanese and Korean chip and electronics producers in the U.S. face disruptions via trade barriers or surging production costs. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0649 GMT - South Korea's benchmark Kospi rose 1.1% to close at 2509.27 amid easing fears over U.S. tariffs. Foreign and institutional investors were net buyers. LG Energy Solution and Samsung SDI gained 3.6% and 3.4%, respectively, after the government prepared a new aid plan for the EV battery industry. Memory-chip maker SK Hynix added 4.0%. Mobile internet giant Kakao climbed 5.6% after agreeing to develop AI Products with OpenAI. Meanwhile, LG CNS, an IT service affiliate of LG Group, fell 9.9% on its stock exchange debut. USD/KRW settled 1.3% lower at 1,444.30 in Seoul onshore trading. South Korea's 10-year government bond yield was down 2.3 bps at 2.821%. (kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0518 GMT - Hong Kong could see a turnaround in retail sales this year on an estimated 25% increase in visitors to the city, with CGS International analysts projecting retail sales gain at 5% for 2025. The city's retail sales by value fell 7.3% in 2024.The easing of visa policies for mainland Chinese visitors to Hong Kong and continued increase in foreign tourists have boosted Hong Kong's visitor numbers, they add. The opening of Kai Tak Sports Park in March and multiple major events including concerts and sporting events should also attract high-spending tourists in 2025 and encourage local consumption, they say. There were encouraging signs in higher visitor numbers from China and other countries over the Lunar New Year holiday, which have boosted hotel bookings and luxury spending, CGS International says. (jiahui.huang@wsj.com; @ivy_jiahuihuang)</p><p class=\"\">0439 GMT - Japan's cash earnings jumped in December, while Moody's Analytics' Stefan Angrick sees little evidence of sustained real wage growth. At first glance, the data suggests things are turning around as monthly cash earnings rose solidly, the economist says, adding that the devil is in the details. Though nominal pay growth is picking up, the gains are uneven, and real cash earnings climbed only 0.6% on year, he says, describing it \"a far more modest gain than the glossy nominal figure.\" The pay bump was also driven significantly by temporary factors, such as bonuses. Wage growth is likely to improve despite strong headwinds expected in 2025, including, but not limited to, a potential inflation spike, he adds. Much depends on the spring wage negotiations. If pay gains come in below 5%, that could delay the rate hikes, he adds. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0422 GMT - Hong Kong PMI data show continued concern among private sector firms about the year ahead as global uncertainty rises. The headline S&amp;P Global PMI for January signaled only a modest improvement in business conditions and slipped to its lowest since September 2024. Weak external demand was the main growth constraint, says Tim Moore, economics director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. \"Survey respondents noted subdued willingness to spend among clients amid concerns about the near-term global economic outlook, in particular the impact of potential U.S. tariffs.\" Export sales fell at the fastest pace since September 2024, while new business from Mainland China decreased to the greatest extent since April 2022. Despite an upturn in total new work, Hong Kong firms remain pessimistic about the year ahead, Moore says. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0402 GMT - Singapore dollar is steady against its U.S. counterpart in the Asian session amid caution over the latest tariffs from the U.S. and China. \"We are only at the beginning of the tariff saga,\" Maybank analysts say in an FX Research &amp; Treasury report. \"It would be wise to be slightly more cautious as there is a likely limit to how much the USD can weaken,\" the analysts say. USD/SGD is little changed at 1.3524. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0339 GMT - The Bank of Korea may cut its policy rate later this month despite January's pickup in domestic inflation, Barclays economist Bum Ki Son writes in a note. Headline inflation accelerated to 2.2% from 1.9% in December, but the BOK may focus on soft core inflation and weak domestic demand, Son says. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, ticked up to 1.9% from 1.8% in December. BOK policymakers see forex-related pressures as limited and oil prices as a one-off shock, he notes. \"As such, we believe inflation is unlikely to stop the BOK from cutting rates 25bp at its February meeting,\" he says.

KEC International (KEC) reported a revenue growth of 6.8% YoY, while EBITDA margin expanded by 85bps YoY to 7.0%. The domestic T&amp;D opportunity pipeline remains strong, driven by increasing momentum in the power sector. Internationally, T&amp;D prospects are expanding across key regions, including the Middle East, Africa, CIS, and the Americas, with Saudi Arabia leading investments in energy transition and T&amp;D infrastructure. SAE Towers continues to witness healthy demand; however, the depreciation of the Brazilian currency against the USD has tempered growth in this segment. Meanwhile, the Oil &amp; Gas sector continues to face challenges due to tendering delays from Oil PSUs. Persistent labor shortages and collection delays in Water projects and Railways have prompted management to revise its topline growth guidance downward from ~15% to 12-14% YoY. In response, the company remains selective in Civil and Railway order bookings, prioritizing cash flow certainty and shorter execution cycles.</p><p class=\"\">Outlook</p><p class=\"\">We remain positive on KEC for the long term given its 1) strong order book, 2) healthy execution momentum, 3) robust T&amp;D outlook, especially in renewable energy, and 4) expansion of Cables business.

Financial markets on Tuesday had a muted reaction to China's retaliatory tariffs of 10%-15% on select U.S. goods, but there's a chance of a stronger reaction down the line if negotiations don't see results, Mohi-uddin says. Should U.S. tariffs on China remain at 10% this year, the impact should be manageable, he notes, adding that the measures will trim about 0.5% from China's GDP growth this year from its 5.0% rate in 2024. However, should the tariffs be raised to 20%-30%, growth may fall closer to 4.0%, Mohi-uddin estimates. (kimberley.kao@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

Taking into account the tariffs' deadlines, a scenario of an impasse on U.S.-China negotiations would probably prompt the PBOC to \"relent\" on USD/CNY fixings and allow USD/CNY to trend higher, the analysts add. USD/CNH is little changed at 7.2861. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0714 GMT - The impact of Trump's 10% tariff on Chinese exports on China's GDP growth this year looks manageable, Bank of Singapore chief economist Mansoor Mohi-uddin writes in a note. If the 10% levy is maintained for the rest of 2025, that would shave around 0.5% off China's GDP growth, he says. But if tariffs are raised to 20% to 30%, that would likely drag China's economic growth this year to 4.0% from 5.0% last year, he adds. That said, Beijing's retaliation, with targeted tariffs aimed at U.S. exports amounting to only $14 billion, leaves the door open for a potential deal with Washington to avert a broader trade war, he adds. (jiahui.huang@wsj.com; @ivy_jiahuihuang)</p><p class=\"\">0704 GMT - The 'tariff can' has just been kicked down the road, with the idea of imposing levies on U.S. imports from its two closest neighbours still not off the table entirely, says Pepperstone's Michael Brown. \"In fact, this whole saga could well rumble on until the start of April, when the review ordered by President Trump into U.S. trade policy is due to report back,\" the senior research strategist says in a note. Trump agreed to postpone the tariffs on Mexico and Canada for a month after talks with the leaders of both countries. \"Perhaps, it is at that point, that we will see tariffs shift from being used as a bargaining chip to further certain political aims, to actually being used as a measure to address trade imbalances,\" Brown says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0659 GMT - Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have dodged tariff bullets for now, but they shouldn't get too comfortable, Moody's Analytics economists say. The three appear obvious targets given their hefty trade surpluses with the U.S. One possible reason is security ties with the U.S. Another is the fact that Japan is among the U.S.'s biggest foreign investors. Korean and Taiwanese firms have been ramping up investment too. That's come at China's expense, aligning with the U.S. bid to curb its influence in supply chains, they add. But the mood could shift and tariffs could come. The economies also face collateral damage. Carmakers like Toyota and Kia have plants in Mexico, and Taiwanese and Korean chip and electronics producers in the U.S. face disruptions via trade barriers or surging production costs. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0649 GMT - South Korea's benchmark Kospi rose 1.1% to close at 2509.27 amid easing fears over U.S. tariffs. Foreign and institutional investors were net buyers. LG Energy Solution and Samsung SDI gained 3.6% and 3.4%, respectively, after the government prepared a new aid plan for the EV battery industry. Memory-chip maker SK Hynix added 4.0%. Mobile internet giant Kakao climbed 5.6% after agreeing to develop AI Products with OpenAI. Meanwhile, LG CNS, an IT service affiliate of LG Group, fell 9.9% on its stock exchange debut. USD/KRW settled 1.3% lower at 1,444.30 in Seoul onshore trading.

The city's retail sales by value fell 7.3% in 2024.The easing of visa policies for mainland Chinese visitors to Hong Kong and continued increase in foreign tourists have boosted Hong Kong's visitor numbers, they add. The opening of Kai Tak Sports Park in March and multiple major events including concerts and sporting events should also attract high-spending tourists in 2025 and encourage local consumption, they say. There were encouraging signs in higher visitor numbers from China and other countries over the Lunar New Year holiday, which have boosted hotel bookings and luxury spending, CGS International says.

Grab is likely to strengthen its leadership position in ride-hailing and deliveries, as it invests into products to help expand its total addressable market with affordable products, they say. However, as the priority will be on new product initiatives, cross-selling and lending products, HSBC trims earlier margin estimates and reduces its adjusted Ebitda projection by 2%-5% for 2025-2026. HSBC lowers its target price to $5.45 from $5.50 but upgrades its stock rating to buy from hold as the stock offers 20% upside, and valuations have become attractive after the recent price correction.

The market is debating on the long-term impact, as optimists argue that a lower entry barrier would attract new players, which should boost semiconductor demand, they write. \"We do not expect much weakness in the near-term demand,\" the analysts note. They add that long-term demand will be determined by changes in AI-driven computing needs, such as inference, noting that such demand could offset the possibly lower computing demand in training. DeepSeek's development marks a major evolution, though not entirely a revolution, in artificial intelligence, they say.

The process poses a significant challenge, given that in 2024, an estimated 4 million daily packages arrived in the U.S. under the de minimis rule, which allows low-value shipments to bypass duties and custom scrutiny, Tam says. The Trump administration revoked this exemption for China as part of broader tariff measures. Among Chinese e-commerce players, PDD Holdings will be hurt as its overseas e-commerce platform Temu has a significant exposure in the U.S., the analyst notes. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
