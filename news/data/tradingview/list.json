But one analyst is now telling management to do a more dramatic restructuring.</p><p class=\"\">Wolfe Research's Peter Supino hasn't been shy about making suggestions to Comcast (CMCSA) Chief Executive Brian Roberts. When he was a Bernstein analyst five years ago, he wrote an open letter suggesting the company spin out NBCUniversal and Sky. \"Recently, when Comcast announced its intention to spin-out its cable TV networks, we thought 'yes, keep going!'\" Supino wrote on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"\">See more: Will Comcast's spinoff of some cable networks give the stock the desired bump?</p><p class=\"\">Today he's back with another open letter urging management to separate into three businesses. \"Three public companies with focused incentives could trade for 57% more\" than Comcast's Monday close of $33.19, he said in a lead-up to the letter.</p><p class=\"\">Comcast didn't immediately respond to a MarketWatch request for comment.</p><p class=\"\">Comcast is a sprawling business that operates television networks, movie studios and theme parks while also running a broadband business in the U.S. and the Sky pay-TV business in the U.K. Media peers Walt Disney Co. (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. (WBD) and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR) each do some of those things, but not all of them, and their stocks all trade for higher multiples of enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Supino noted.</p><p class=\"\">\"We believe that the market discounts Comcast's value severely because of concerns about returns on capital and instances of misalignment of leadership and shareholders,\" Supino wrote in the letter. \"We truly believe that as long as Comcast persists as a conglomerate, such concerns are likely to hamper the stock.\"</p><p class=\"\">Supino worried that it would be difficult for Comcast to accelerate its Xfinity cable business, which makes up more than half of its revenue but is besieged by competitive pressures. As he put it, \"very high cable broadband prices have attracted strong competition that many people prefer.\"</p><p class=\"\">Don't miss: Comcast seen taking 'one step forward, two steps back' in tough broadband market</p><p class=\"\">Add together broadcast television, Peacock streaming, cable networks and Sky, and you get another group unlikely to show an acceleration, in Supino's view. \"Comcast's media portfolio, excluding Universal and NBC Sports, has been disrupted and seemingly passed competitively,\" he wrote.</p><p class=\"\">Meanwhile, Comcast has a \"vibrant\" theme-park and movie business in Universal, according to Supino. But he thinks this unit has a hard time moving the needle for the overall company, Universal's studios and parks account for just 16% of gross revenue.</p><p class=\"\">A breakup of the company would create \"focused, long-term equity incentives to align and embolden management,\" Supino wrote.</p><p class=\"\">Were Comcast to make the move, it wouldn't be alone, as General Electric broke into three companies last year.</p><p class=\"\">-Emily Bary</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
