It is unclear whether these tariffs are a long-term policy or a negotiation tactic by President Trump to secure concessions, the strategist notes. At the margin, these tariffs should encourage more domestic production of goods in the United States. However, the uncertainty surrounding the permanence of these tariffs makes it challenging for companies to make informed capital investment decisions, Dover adds. Chinese policymakers and businesses are likely to implement measures to mitigate the impact should the situation escalate further, Dover notes.

According to China's commerce ministry, 326 Chinese enterprises registered to invest in Mexico in 2023, up from 133 in 2020. The economists think the trend is not only tariff driven, but also due to supply chain shifts. \"Low industrial profit under overcapacity concerns and relatively high production costs drives supply-chain shift overseas,\" they say. ANZ expects more overseas investment from Chinese companies to reduce reliance on traditional markets and diversify trade influence, they add.

The negotiations between the U.S. and its neighbors suggest that there is some hope of de-escalation at some point, though the road ahead is likely to be bumpy, Zhang says. Washington postponed tariffs on Canada and Mexico after reaching border-related deals. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0629 GMT - ​The top risk for 2025 identified by ETF provider Global X was policy sequencing across taxes, tariffs and deregulation. These are now now playing out, potentially causing more volatility in rates markets, says Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy. \"This is likely a source for increased volatility in the rate market more so than serious disruption for companies and equities, but this is early days,\" he says in a note. U.S. President Trump moved to levy tariffs on Mexico and Canada, but the leaders of the three states reached an agreement to put tariffs on hold for a month. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

Beijing responded to Trump's 10% blanket tariffs on Chinese imports with a series of tariffs on U.S. products like coal. By OE's estimates, the move raises the weighted effective tariff rate on U.S. imports into China by close to +2ppt, \"thereby a more symbolic move for now.\" The blanket-style U.S. tariffs plus stronger retaliation language imply a very high chance of further action by the U.S., economist Louise Loo says. OE thinks China will continue with meticulously targeted tariff lists and lean on defensive measures like tax rebates and support for exporters. It may also deploy export controls and probes into U.S. companies. As markets price more uncertainty, the yuan is likely to come under continued pressure, OE says.
