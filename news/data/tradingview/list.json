            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">The U.K. FTSE 100 index could rise to a new all-time high if the Bank of England signals additional future interest-rate cuts during Thursday's rate decision, Capital.com's Daniela Sabin Hathorn says in a note. \"A BOE rate cut could renew investor interest in U.K. stocks,\" she says. The FTSE 100 reached a new high of 8692.84 on Jan. 31. Any hints of more interest-rate cuts could reignite a U.K. equities rally, Hathorn says. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Bank Indonesia may cut rates by 25 bps in 1Q, bringing its policy rate to 5.50%, likely at its February policy meeting, as it prioritizes postpandemic easing, Barclays economist Brian Tan says in a note. Despite stable 4Q GDP growth, policymakers are expected to remain focused on reversing previous rate hikes, he notes. With USD/IDR stable around 16,300, another cut is likely, he reckons. Inflation softened in January, prompting a downward revision to Tan's 2025 average inflation forecast to 1.4% from 1.7%, below BI's 1.5%-3.5% target. If electricity discounts are extended beyond February, inflation could fall further, strengthening the case for continued monetary easing, he adds. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Oil prices edge lower in early trade despite U.S. President Trump ramping up pressure on Iran. Brent crude is down 0.7% to $75.68 a barrel, while WTI falls 0.6% to $72.25 a barrel. Trump signed a directive restoring his \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Tehran with the aim to stop the country from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Stricter enforcement of sanctions could put as much as 1 million barrels a day of oil supply at risk, according to ING analysts. \"However, reduced flows from Iran will not help in lowering oil prices, something that President Trump is very keen to achieve,\" they say. \"He would need to see OPEC increase oil output to offset any potential Iranian losses.\" Prices are pressured by fears that a trade war between the U.S. and China could hurt global growth and increase inflationary pressures, damping demand for crude.
