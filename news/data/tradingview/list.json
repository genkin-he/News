            "title": "House Republicans Are Split on How Deeply to Cut Federal Spending — WSJ",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Richard Rubin and Olivia Beavers</p><p class=\"\">WASHINGTON — House Republicans are sharply divided over how much government spending they should cut, and the dispute is slowing their plans to reduce taxes and increase border enforcement.</p><p class=\"\">On one side: Conservatives who see a rare chance to use full Republican government control to scale back programs such as Medicaid, the health-insurance program covering more than 70 million people. At times, they have been seeking trillions of dollars in spending cuts over the next decade and say they want Republicans' major fiscal legislation to reduce budget deficits.</p><p class=\"\">On the other side: Moderates who are wary about blowback from states, hospitals and the GOP's emerging working-class base. They are looking for smaller minimum spending cuts attached to the \"one big beautiful bill\" that President Trump wants to extend expiring tax cuts, pay for his immigration restrictions and boost the military.</p><p class=\"\">Party leaders are stuck in the middle. Because of the party's tiny House majority, they must keep virtually all House Republicans together on a budget blueprint and a subsequent detailed bill. One early proposal circulating among lawmakers and lobbyists lays out about $300 billion in spending cuts and a roughly equal amount in spending increases. Under that approach, Trump's 2017 tax cuts — $4 trillion or more over a decade — could potentially be extended without accompanying spending cuts.</p><p class=\"\">House Republicans must resolve or postpone the fight before taking the first major step forward — a Budget Committee vote on a resolution setting minimum spending cuts and a maximum deficit increase for Trump's big bill. Even though the ultimate bill could produce smaller deficits than the maximum set in the budget, this moment is an important leverage point in setting the terms for the year's debate. Some Republicans pushed back against that early blueprint, and they haven't reached agreement among themselves yet.</p><p class=\"\">Congress is moving on a different track than the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency. The effort led by billionaire Elon Musk has targeted some spending, and canceled contracts and employee resignations might reduce agencies' costs. But the real money is in the federal programs that provide incomes and healthcare for low-income households and retirees. and changing those requires Congress.</p><p class=\"\">House Speaker Mike Johnson (R., La.) had said a budget vote would happen this week, but aides said late Monday that the committee wouldn't act this week. It is the first public slippage in the party's aggressive schedule.</p><p class=\"\">House Republicans \"are working right now to negotiate what that looks like,\" Johnson said on Fox News. \"We don't want to blow a hole in the deficit by extending the Trump-era tax cuts, for example, but we're definitely going to get that extended. So, we got to find those savings, \" he said.</p><p class=\"\">The budget resolution is the crucial first step in the process that lets Republicans get their fiscal agenda through Congress without needing Democratic votes. The process, called budget reconciliation, allows lawmakers to bypass the usual 60-vote filibuster threshold in the Senate.</p><p class=\"\">\"It's always going to be a battle, but that's fine,\" said Rep. Ralph Norman (R., S.C.), a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, who also sits on the Budget Committee and is pushing for deep cuts. \"Shoot for the stars, and if you have to come down, that's fine. Don't shoot at the lowest number and then expect to go up.\"</p><p class=\"\">Brutal math</p><p class=\"\">Over the next decade, the U.S. government is projected to collect $67.5 trillion in taxes and spend $89.3 trillion, sending publicly held debt as a share of gross domestic product to record levels. Republicans say they want to start closing the gap. But the math is brutal.</p><p class=\"\">Extending Trump's expiring tax cuts and adding his new ideas — like no tax on tips — would subtract more than $5 trillion from revenue. Agency spending and Social Security are generally outside the bounds of one-party reconciliation bills. Paying interest on the debt isn't optional, and Trump also has taken Medicare largely off the table.</p><p class=\"\">With those categories protected, that leaves about $16 trillion in spending that could be eyed for cuts. About half of that is Medicaid, the healthcare program largely for low-income people that is largely run by states.</p><p class=\"\">Republicans have floated several ideas to lower Medicaid's costs. One would lower the minimum share of a state's costs that the federal government pays, a change that could affect states including California and New York. Another possible change would prevent states from imposing taxes on Medicaid providers in ways that raise federal reimbursements. Republicans might also consider creating work requirements for able-bodied Medicaid recipients.</p><p class=\"\">\"Every member of Congress represents a state with a governor and state legislators who will absolutely pressure them to essentially not dump the budget deficit on states,\" said Brian Riedl, a former Senate GOP aide now at the Manhattan Institute.</p><p class=\"\">Riedl said he was dubious Republicans could make trillions of dollars of spending cuts, especially with a House majority of 220-215 at most. \"There is more overlap with Democrats on the tax-cut extensions than there is unanimity about cutting trillions,\" he said.</p><p class=\"\">Centrist Republicans worry that steep cuts could cost the party voters in the 2026 election.</p><p class=\"\">\"If you cut Medicaid, you're, like, pissing off the people who put you in office — who Trump resonates with, right?\" said one House Republican. \"So you got to be careful about how you do it, if you do it.\"</p><p class=\"\">'Different pain thresholds'</p><p class=\"\">Another House Republican recalled a colleague standing up during the GOP's recent Florida retreat and arguing, to applause, that they didn't want to let the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee expand budget deficits.</p><p class=\"\">\"There are different views on tax, there's different pain thresholds on spending,\" this lawmaker said. \"So maybe this does fall apart. Maybe this notion that there's going to be an all-Republican thing on tax, maybe it's a bridge too far.\"</p><p class=\"\">Republicans should seek a middle ground, one that makes progress on deficits while preventing tax increases that would occur in 2026 if they do nothing, said Don Schneider, a former House GOP aide now at investment firm Piper Sandler.</p><p class=\"\">The best path, he said, sets a reasonable floor for the size of the spending cuts and relies on Trump's ability to unify the party.</p><p class=\"\">\"He can be the guy that tips the scales in favor of spending cuts but he's going to need to give members the cover to accept these difficult choices,\" Schneider said.</p><p class=\"\">Republicans will look for other ways to claim that their plans reduce deficits without major spending cuts. One way is to point to revenue from Trump's tariffs.</p><p class=\"\">The other is by arguing that the extension of expiring tax cuts doesn't actually cost anything. The Republican Study Committee, a core group of conservative members, said any tax bill must reduce the deficit — but didn't specify whether that was being measured before or after extending $5 trillion in tax cuts.</p><p class=\"\">Ultimately, the important numbers won't be measured in the trillions but in the votes needed to get majorities in the House and Senate.</p><p class=\"\">\"The numbers that I always tell people you have to keep in mind are 218 and 51,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R., S.D.) said on Fox News Radio.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com and Olivia Beavers at Olivia.Beavers@wsj.com</p></span></div>",

Bloomberg reported Tuesday that talks between the ride-hailing companies over a possible combination have recently intensified. They would likely save costs on competing user subsidies, as well as see faster new user acquisition with broader product offerings and better reach to lower-tier cities, Yap says. There could also be better user targeting, cross-selling of financial services and increased advertising revenue on both platforms, Yap adds. Both brands would likely continue running independently, but there could be back-end integration of systems and more collaboration regarding merchant management and sharing their rider and vehicle pool, Yap adds. Citi retains a buy rating on Grab with a target of $5.90. Shares last closed at $4.54. (kimberley.kao@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

Additionally, Presearch complies with the RTA (Restricted to Adults) industry standard. </p><p class=\"\">“I’m 1,000% confident that once users—especially remote workers and digital nomads—experience this new search paradigm, they’ll never want to go back to basic, boring search again,” said Brenden Tacon, Business Development Lead at Presearch. “We’re offering users a unique, enticing, and pleasurable search experience while fostering inclusivity and freedom of expression, which all aligns with the Presearch Ethos. At the same time, we’re addressing a major void in the market and meeting a significant demand by providing advertisers in the adult industry with a critical platform.”</p><p class=\"\">Presearch Takeover Advertising has become a game-changer in the industry, empowering brands by eliminating invasive tracking methods and offering advertisers a unique opportunity to reach privacy-conscious users. By expanding into the NSFW space, Presearch opens new doors for adult brands often excluded from mainstream advertising platforms, ensuring they can reach their audience without compromising ethical standards.</p><p class=\"\">The “Spicy” NSFW feature is available now.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">    Simplicity is hard. For all the breezy and cavalier rhetoric that pushy investors, bankers and CEOs use to tout the benefits of breaking up companies, such efforts often fail to generate the anticipated or promised results. With a fresh wave of spinoffs in the works, it’s a good time to brush up on some harsh financial realities.</p><p class=\"\">Whether for reasons related to ego, pay or simplistic growth, most bosses want to enlarge their empires, not shrink them. It’s also usually easier to buy a peer and hack out costs than it is to extract a business already tangled up inside a bigger enterprise. Although conglomerates have fallen out of favor, the ability to create value over the long term by splitting them into more narrowly focused operations sounds as dubious as the notion of one plus one making three in an acquisition.</p><p class=\"\">There are plenty of historic examples for the latest crop of cleavers to consider. Over the past decade, CEOs worldwide have unveiled nearly $1.7 trillion of spinoffs and similar separations, where a unit started trading independently with a market capitalization of at least $1 billion. That’s according to Dealogic data which excludes divisional sales to corporate or private equity buyers. And plenty more are being teed up. Common rationales include streamlining operations, helping bosses focus, highlighting faster growing or more profitable divisions, and taking advantage of valuation discrepancies.</p><p class=\"\">Pork producer WH Group  last week spun off its U.S.-based Smithfield subsidiary for many of those reasons, as well as to draw geographic distinctions with its China business. Holcim , the Swiss building-materials maker, is doing the same with its North American arm. Cable operator Comcast  plans to create a new publicly traded company for a stable of networks including CNBC, while diversified manufacturer Honeywell International  faces pressure from aggressive shareholder Elliott Investment Management to sever aerospace and defense from industrial automation. DuPont, the chemicals company that already divided itself into three units under Ed Breen’s stewardship, intends to splinter yet again.</p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:1097.9381443298969px;aspect-ratio:1.8298969072164948\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L3N3OR1ET-0463315b7c51aa683815e0a1fa70e18f-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"Line chart comparing the 10-year performances of the Invesco S&amp;P Spin-off ETF and the S&amp;P 500 Index.\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L3N3OR1ET-0463315b7c51aa683815e0a1fa70e18f-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f5f3f5\"/></picture></div><figcaption class=\"caption-S5VA5POt\"><span class=\"copyright-S5VA5POt\">Thomson Reuters</span><span class=\"description-S5VA5POt\">Spinoff stocks have lagged the broader market</span></figcaption></figure></span></p><p class=\"\">The logic of such moves often sounds compelling, but the outcomes are mixed at best. Separations led to a blended excess return about 6% higher than for their respective sector indices, research conducted by Goldman Sachs and consultancy EY found. Morgan Stanley strategists discovered, after studying some 400 deals over two decades, that parent companies underperformed the market by about 8% and the spinoffs outperformed by more than 10%. It’s questionable, however, whether two years, which both Morgan Stanley and Goldman use as their cutoff point, is enough time to judge the performance. Since its 2015 debut, the S&amp;P U.S. Spin-off Index has lagged the S&amp;P 500 Index .</p><p class=\"\">Further analysis, conducted by Breakingviews, presents additional cause for skepticism. The sample covered 60 chunky U.S. examples since 2015 where both parent and SpinCo are still publicly listed. More than a third of the time, one of the two companies has generated a negative total shareholder return, after factoring in reinvested dividends. In eight cases, both destroyed value following a split, as has occurred with Xerox  and Conduent  since they separated in 2017 and Bath &amp; Body Works  and Victoria’s Secret  since 2021.</p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:934.2105263157895px;aspect-ratio:1.557017543859649\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L3N3OR1ET-96ca3b48d441585fb4a9bba48b1ddcfa-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"A scatter plot chart which compares the total shareholder returns by parent companies (orange squares) and their spinoffs (blue squares), by the date of each spinoff up to Jan. 7, 2025\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L3N3OR1ET-96ca3b48d441585fb4a9bba48b1ddcfa-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f5f5f6\"/></picture></div><figcaption class=\"caption-S5VA5POt\"><span class=\"copyright-S5VA5POt\">Thomson Reuters</span><span class=\"description-S5VA5POt\">Split decisions: spinoffs deliver patchy returns</span></figcaption></figure></span></p><p class=\"\">Even some of the seemingly strong stories are inconsistent. For example, after e-commerce giant eBay  capitulated in mid-2015 to billionaire investor Carl Icahn’s demand that it spin off PayPal , both companies trounced the broader market’s returns over the ensuing five years. The outperformance vanished, and then some, in the near decade through January, however. Hewlett Packard’s split in the same year as eBay’s represents a rare instance of both companies keeping up with the S&amp;P 500 Index.</p><p class=\"\">Despite the patchy results, aggressive hedge funds routinely turn to the breakup chapter in their playbooks to target corporate sprawl. Most recently, Elliott put $5 billion into Honeywell, the single biggest investment in its nearly five-decade history, as part of a campaign to convince boss Vimal Kapur to split the company. As part of its pitch projecting an up to 75% share-price boost over two years, the firm cherry-picked examples such as General Electric  and United Technologies, now called RTX , and “countless others that have found success through simplification.”</p><p class=\"\">It’s fair to say that the breakups at GE and United Technologies have served shareholders well so far. The duo also capitalized on big uplifts in demand and valuation multiples for power providers like GE Vernova  and cooling-system installers such as Carrier Global . Those conditions are hard to replicate, especially considering how long it often takes to pull apart the various components. Moreover, GE’s healthcare arm has generated lower returns than the S&amp;P 500, as has RTX’s separated elevator business, Otis Worldwide .</p><p class=\"\">Like the conglomerates themselves, it takes many smoothly moving parts to get a split right. They include the respective capital structures, management, division of assets and customer experiences. Finding the right fund managers and brokers to cover the two pieces can also be make or break. The prospect of a corporate cleanup always holds appeal, but it’s often hard to cut clearly through the spin.</p><p class=\"\">Follow @jgfarb on X</p></span></div>",

UBS' franchise strength continued to drive client inflows, with its global wealth management division pulling in $97 billion in net new assets, while the asset management unit recorded net new money of $45 billion. </p><p class=\"\">The bank also benefited from heightened client activity in the fourth quarter, with underlying transaction-based income posting a double-digit annual increase in both global wealth management and personal and corporate banking. UBS delivered $700 million in gross cost savings in the fourth quarter, bringing total savings to $3.4 billion for the year. </p><p class=\"\">\"Strong financial performance reflects our unwavering commitment to serving our clients; the strength of our diversified global franchise; and the progress we have made on our integration.

Still, the board declared a dividend of $0.90 per share for the period, up from the year-ago payment of $0.70 per share. UBS also revealed plans to repurchase $1 billion worth of its shares in the first half and another $2 billion in the second half of 2025. </p><p class=\"\">Looking ahead, UBS expects net interest income in its global wealth management unit to decline by a low-to-mid single-digit percentage sequentially in the first quarter, with NII in personal and corporate banking to fall by around 10% in Swiss francs. Meanwhile, integration-related expenses are estimated at about $1.1 billion as the bank advances its post-merger plans. </p><p class=\"\">Deutsche Bank Research said UBS' results were \"well ahead of expectations\" but noted the divisional mix could have been stronger. \"Furthermore, capital was effectively in line, the 2025 share buyback in line with expectations though the 2H25 tranche is conditional, cost reductions are quicker than expected and net inflows were ok in Global Wealth Management and high in Asset Management,\" the analysts said. </p><p class=\"\">The stock fell almost 6% in midmorning trade.</p></span></div>",

Year to date, shares have fallen 3.7%.</p><p class=\"\">The telecommunications company said revenue in Germany fell 7.6% on a reported basis to 3.09 billion euros ($3.20 billion). Service revenue--a closely watched metric in the telecom sector--in the country represents 34% of group service revenue and fell 6.4% to 2.89 billion euros for the quarter ended Dec. 31. This was partly due to the expected impact from German regulatory changes, which prevent landlords from bundling TV services with rental agreements, as well as lower broadband customer base.</p><p class=\"\">Germany's turnaround will take time as the group is still absorbing the impact of the law change and face a highly competitive market environment, Chief Executive Margherita Della Valle said on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"\">Meanwhile, U.K. service revenue climbed 3.3% on organic basis to 1.51 billion euros, boosted by significant investments in customer experience. On a group level, service revenue rose to 7.93 billion euros from 7.505 billion euros.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and after lease expenses increased 2.2% on an organic basis to 2.83 billion euros. This was driven by service revenue growth in most markets and lower energy costs in Europe that offset the law impact in Germany. Revenue rose to 9.81 billion euros from 9.35 million euros.</p><p class=\"\">This represents the first set of earnings following the group's exit from Italy. Vodafone sale of the Italian business to Swisscom was approved by Italy's competition regulator in the quarter, marking the final step for getting full clearance. The proceeds, 8 billion euros in cash, have been used to reduce the group's net debt.</p><p class=\"\">Vodafone expects to complete the merger of its U.K. business with its rival operator Three during the first half of 2025, putting an end to group's reshaping plan for growth, Della Valle said.</p><p class=\"\">Separately, the group launched a share buyback of up to 480 million euros to reduce its share capital.</p><p class=\"\">Vodafone reiterated its fiscal 2025 guidance, which includes adjusted EbitdaaL of around 11.0 billion euros and adjusted free cash flow to be at least 2.4 billion euros.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Najat Kantouar at najat.kantouar@wsj.com</p></span></div>",

That result brings its year-end result excluding Russia and Belarus to 975 million euros, an 8% miss compared with consensus. Year-end profit for the Vienna-based bank including Russia and Belarus came to 1.16 billion euros, better than Citi had anticipated, the analyst says. Citi says that the bank's result excluding Russia and Belarus, given the number of one-offs the bank faced including a provision and the effect of deconsolidating its Belarus business, is largely in line with expectations. Shares trade 1.6% higher at 20.36 euros.

President Trump delayed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports for one month after the countries reached an agreement, though an additional 10% China tariff has proceeded. The broader end point around further U.S. tariff developments remain uncertain, Macquarie analysts say in a note. From the perspective of industrial metals, the implementation of the tariffs for any period of time will be a net bearish development, Macquarie says. The tariffs would drag on global goods demand and industrial production growth, by extension hurting commodities demand. At the same time, they would introduce further headwinds by boosting the U.S. dollar and reducing rate cut prospects, Macquarie adds. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0943 GMT - Singapore's FTSE Straits Times Index edged 0.1% lower to close at 3823.01, bucking the regional trend. China said earlier that it will impose new tariffs on some U.S. imports, responding to President Trump's latest levy on Chinese goods. Beijing's tariff retaliation \"inadvertently ups the ante on an escalatory tit-for-tat trade conflict\" if Trump exercises the clause in his executive order to raise levies in response to retaliation, Vishnu Varathan, head of macro research for Asia ex-Japan at Mizuho Securities (Singapore), says in an email. Among the worst performers on the benchmark index, Venture Corp. fell 3.2%, while Sembcorp Industries and SATS dropped 1.8% each.

The impact on the three parent companies' shares will be limited, and the merger could generate savings of about 110 million euros, they add. When shared among the companies, the analysts estimate that this represents a 15% of 2024 EBIT for Airbus, 1.5% for Thales, and 1.3% for Leonardo. Airbus' shares are down 0.5% at 165.93 euros, Thales' shares are down 0.5% at 156.5 euros, and Leonardo's shares are down 1.1% at 30.24 euros.

The year-end remediation charges stand at 249 million pounds, compared with January's guidance range of 245 million pounds to 255 million pounds, he says. The housebuilder's remediation program is expected to be completed during 2029, addressing any lingering concerns regarding its future legacy fire-related liabilities, and giving greater confidence in its valuation and business case, he says. \"While the guidance midpoint is lower than consensus, we welcome the reiteration of fire safety remediation after an audited review, and the news of a strategy update in March,\" Codling says.

The owner of Nivea skincare products is monitoring the international backdrop as it plans potential measures to \"adapt to new developments\", the spokesperson adds, without disclosing further details. \"The U.S. market remains a strategic growth market for Beiersdorf, which we intend to expand further in the coming years. We have already invested in the U.S. market in recent years and continue to build on this\". Beiersdorf's sales in North America in 2023 represented nearly 13% of its total sales.

For now, the market doesn't seem too concerned that China announced retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods, he adds. Still, Chew expects volatility in the local market to rise as investors closely monitor the U.S. and Malaysian earnings seasons and Trump's foreign policies. He sees support for the KLCI at 1535 and resistance at 1590. Among gainers, CIMB Group rose 2.4% and Sunway Bhd. climbed 2.3%.

The French bank's quarterly result as well as it CET1 ratio exceeded expectations, the analyst says. The bank's new 2024-2026 net income growth rate target suggests at least a 4% consensus upgrade, Reingen says. The slight fall in the bank's 2025 return on tangible equity to 11.5% from a range of 11.5% to 12% previously, given consensus expectations at 10.4%, should offer relief to investors fearing a steeper downgrade. BNP Paribas' targeted revenue growth of at least 5% per year for 2025-2026 is also higher than investors had expected. BNP shares trade 2.5% higher to 65.94 euros.

BNP Paribas's investment and protection services unit disappointed but the business should benefit later this year from external growth, the analyst says.

(mauro.orru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0853 GMT - Diageo's 1H performance was satisfactory and likely exceeded market expectations, with signs of stabilization as sales were up by 1% and profits down by 1%, Quilter Cheviot's Chris Beckett says. Diageo's decision to remove medium-term guidance of 5%-7% organic sales growth might upset some investors. However, this move is acceptable given that the target was laid during the pandemic--when demand for alcohol was exceptionally high--and unrealistic given the current environment, Beckett writes in a note. Additionally, the owner of Johnnie Walker, Guinness and Smirnoff seems to be effectively managing its significant debt, given that the dividend remained unchanged amid concerns of a potential cut, Beckett says. Diageo's 2H performance is likely to be similar if U.S. tariffs are not imposed, he adds. Shares are down 3.3% and nearly 20% over the last 52 weeks. (michael.susin@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Sterling falls on the day but remains comfortably above Monday's lows against the dollar when U.S. President Trump's tariffs on Canada and Mexico--which he later agreed to pause--unsettled markets. ING analyst Francesco Pesole says any sterling losses should be limited because tariffs shouldn't unduly harm the U.K. economy. Exports to the U.S. are less than 2% of gross domestic product, while Trump \"seems in no rush to hit the U.K. with tariffs,\" he says in a note. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's trip to Brussels to discuss security and defence is positive for sterling as it signals intent to repair EU relations, he says. Sterling falls 0.3% to $1.2409, still well above Monday's low of $1.2248. EUR/GBP rises 0.1% to 0.8322. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
