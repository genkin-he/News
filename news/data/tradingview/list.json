Stakers already benefitted from the decentralized protocol WOOFi, which gives 80% of transaction fees in the form of yield. This differentiates WOO as a token with value accrued from across centralized and decentralized finance.</p><p class=\"\">Over the past two weeks, WOO X has averaged $500M in daily trading volume, resulting in an additional 55,000 USDC set to be distributed to stakers on Feb. 10th. With WOOFi revenue added in, WOO stakers will share a pool of over a quarter of a million dollars - the bulk of which is being auto-compounded to buy back and stake onchain.</p><p class=\"\">To maximize your rewards, <strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">stake more WOO today</strong> —increased stakes mean higher returns, and with the enhanced staking mechanics, WOO stakers will benefit from even greater value capture. As a reward, WOO stakers receive 0.1 basis points from all spot and perpetual trading volumes on WOO X.</p><p class=\"\">To learn more about WOO X, download our app or visit our WOO X</p><p class=\"\">Contact: media@woo.network</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About WOO X</strong></p><p class=\"\">WOO X is a global centralized crypto futures and spot trading platform offering the best-in-class liquidity and price execution.

Trump postponed for a month tariffs on Canada and Mexico. </p><p class=\"\">A reduced tariff rate of 10% was to be applied to energy imports from Canada, compared to 25% on other goods, likely due to Canada being the U.S.' most important oil supplier, the bank noted. </p><p class=\"\">In 2024, the U.S. sourced more than 4 million barrels of its daily crude imports from Canada, equivalent to more than 60% of total U.S. crude imports. Mexico accounted for around 470,000 barrels per day (b/d) or, 7% of crude imports. </p><p class=\"\">Venezuela could have been considered as an alternative supplier due to proximity and comparable quality of oil, but Trump announced that the U.S. would no longer buy oil from Venezuela. In 2024, U.S. imports from Venezuela averaged 220,000 b/d, Commerzbank said. </p><p class=\"\">Brazil and Guyana could be possible alternative suppliers, but it is doubtful that imports from these countries can be increased significantly within a short period of time, the bank said. </p><p class=\"\">U.S. refineries may have reduced their purchases of crude oil from Canada and Mexico to avoid paying tariffs, which would have led to a shortage of oil supply in the U.S. and lower crude processing activity, according to Commerzbank. </p><p class=\"\">The increased costs for imported crude from Canada and Mexico would have been passed on to U.S. consumers by the refineries in the form of higher gasoline prices, the bank said.</p></span></div>",

The pace of backlog accumulation is at its fastest in eight months and strong demand prompted non-oil companies to raise their selling prices for the first time in over a quarter. </p><p class=\"\">\"The UAE PMI signalled another good month for the non-oil private sector in January,\" S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence senior economist David Owens said. \"Robust expansions in activity and new business, as well as lower input cost inflation, suggest the economy is in a healthy position.\"</p><p class=\"\">On the other hand, S&amp;P noted that total business confidence is at an over two-year low. For the January survey, only 9% of businesses said they are expecting activity growth in the next 12 months. </p><p class=\"\">\"Strong competition and cash flow concerns arising from heavy backlogs have appeared to sow doubt among firms that they can continue to boost their revenues, underlining efforts to reduce the gap between output and input prices,\" Owens wrote. </p><p class=\"\">Zooming in the Emirates' second-largest city, the headline Dubai PMI fell to 55.3 from 55.5 in the period, with total activity up, thanks to new business inflows and easing cost pressures. The city's non-oil companies, however, are also weighed down by the country-wide issues in employment and outlook for future business activity.</p></span></div>",
