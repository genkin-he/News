The company set new benchmarks for full-year revenue, net income, and adjusted EBITDA margins. Fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.0%, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 140 basis points, driven by productivity savings, strong price realization, and higher volume.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments</strong></p> <p class=\"\">The Board of Directors declared a first-quarter dividend of $0.40 per share, an increase of 11%, payable on March 19, 2025. Additionally, the company experienced a non-recurring gain on the remeasurement of its previously held equity interest in Idrica, partially offset by non-recurring tax benefits in the prior year, a loss on the sale of businesses, and increased restructuring and realignment costs.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Management's Perspective</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Matthew Pine, Xylem’s CEO, commented, \"The team delivered a strong fourth quarter to close a record-breaking year for Xylem. We set new benchmarks for full-year revenue, net income, and adjusted EBITDA margins, and earnings per share, with the team showing great operating discipline across the portfolio. All segments delivered strong Q4 orders growth, giving us momentum coming into 2025 on resilient underlying demand.\"</p><p class=\"\">He further added, \"In a year of transition and transformation, the team focused on what matters while delivering on the initiatives that have laid the foundation for sustainable growth and value creation. Our 2025 guidance reflects the team’s commitment to our long-term framework as we continue to enable our customers to address the world’s greatest water challenges.\"</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Future Outlook</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Looking ahead, Xylem forecasts full-year 2025 revenue of approximately $8.6 to $8.7 billion, up approximately 0 to 2% on a reported basis and up approximately 3 to 4% on an organic basis. The company expects full-year 2025 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 21.3 to 21.8%, an increase of 70 to 120 basis points from 2024 adjusted results.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Energizer Holdings, Inc., a leading manufacturer of batteries and portable lighting products, has released its financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024. The company reported a solid performance with growth in both net sales and earnings, driven by strategic initiatives and operational efficiencies.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Financial Highlights</strong></p> <p class=\"\">For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Energizer Holdings, Inc. reported net sales of $731.7 million, a 2.1% increase compared to $716.6 million in the prior year period. Organic net sales grew by 3.8%, reflecting strong performance in both the Battery and Auto Care segments. The company achieved a gross margin of 36.8% on a reported basis and 40.0% on an adjusted basis, representing a 50 basis point improvement over the prior year's adjusted gross margin.</p><p class=\"\">Earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter were $0.30, with adjusted EPS at $0.67, marking a 14% increase on an adjusted basis. Adjusted EBITDA also saw growth, reaching $140.7 million compared to $132.9 million in the same period last year. The company successfully reduced its net leverage to 4.7 times, driven by debt paydown and adjusted EBITDA growth.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Business and Operational Highlights</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Energizer's net sales growth was supported by new and expanded distribution, particularly in the Battery &amp; Lights segment, which saw a volume increase of approximately 3.8%. Additionally, hurricanes contributed roughly $10 million in incremental volume, equating to about 1.4% in organic growth. The Auto Care segment also experienced volume increases due to distribution gains, international market expansion, and growth in digital commerce, partially offset by an earlier shift in holiday orders.</p><p class=\"\">Gross margin improvement was largely attributed to Project Momentum, which delivered savings of approximately $16 million in the quarter. However, these benefits were partially offset by planned strategic pricing and promotional investments, as well as unfavorable currency impacts.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments</strong></p> <p class=\"\">The company continued to focus on debt reduction, paying down approximately $25 million in long-term debt during the first quarter. This marks the tenth consecutive quarter of debt reduction. Dividend payments totaled approximately $24 million, or $0.30 per common share. Energizer also invested in building and scaling capabilities in innovation, distribution, and digital commerce to drive consistent growth.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Management's Perspective</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Mark LaVigne, Chief Executive Officer of Energizer Holdings, Inc., expressed satisfaction with the company's strong start to fiscal 2025. He highlighted the 2.1% increase in net sales and 3.8% growth in organic net sales, with notable performance in both Batteries and Auto Care. LaVigne emphasized the company's commitment to executing its strategies, which resulted in mid-single-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA and a 14% increase in adjusted EPS.</p><p class=\"\">LaVigne also noted the company's continued investment in innovation, distribution, and digital commerce, which are essential for driving long-term shareholder value.</p> <p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Future Outlook</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Looking ahead, Energizer Holdings, Inc. has increased its outlook for organic net sales growth to 2% to 3% for fiscal 2025. The company reaffirmed its expectations for adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $625 million to $645 million and adjusted EPS to be between $3.45 and $3.65.

BetMGM has based forward-looking statements on management's current expectations, assumptions and projections about future events and trends. Examples of these statements include, but are not limited to, BetMGM's expectations regarding its financial outlook (including forecasted net revenues from operations, EBITDA, and expected investment by Entain and MGM Resorts in 2024), projected market share position, its expected growth in new and existing jurisdictions, product capabilities, and achievement of key milestones. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, conditions or results, and involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Included among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking statements are: the significant competition within the gaming and entertainment industry; BetMGM's ability to execute on its business plan; changes in applicable laws or regulations, particularly with respect to iGaming and online sports betting; BetMGM's ability to manage growth and access the capital needed to support its growth plans; and BetMGM's ability to obtain the required licenses, permits and other approvals necessary to grow in existing and new jurisdictions. In providing forward-looking statements, BetMGM is not undertaking any duty or obligation to update these statements publicly as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. If BetMGM updates one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that it will make additional updates with respect to those other forward-looking statements.</p><p class=\"\">Non-GAAP Financial Information</p><p class=\"\">In this press release we provide certain financial measures, including Net Revenue, EBITDA, and Contribution from operations, which have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP. BetMGM believes these measures, which it uses for its own analysis of operations, are useful to supplement the results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  If BetMGM presented Net Revenue from operations in accordance with GAAP, then BetMGM would present the revenues associated with its Nevada digital and retail sports betting operations differently, until such time as BetMGM is licensed as a Nevada gaming operator. Currently under GAAP, its calculation of Net Revenue would be on a basis net of operating costs, such that the GAAP reported Net Revenue would be lower than the Net Revenue reported herein, with net income remaining the same. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before the impact of interest income or expense (net), income tax provision or benefit, and depreciation and amortization.  We define Contribution as Net Revenue, less cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) and marketing acquisition spend.</p><p class=\"\">About BetMGM</p><p class=\"\">BetMGM is a market leading sports betting and gaming entertainment company, pioneering the online gaming industry.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">AIMIA REPORTS FINAL RESULTS OF ITS SUBSTANTIAL ISSUER BID</p><p class=\"\">Canada NewsWire</p><p class=\"\">TORONTO, Feb. 4, 2025</p><p class=\"\">TORONTO, Feb. 4, 2025 /CNW/ - Aimia Inc.  (\"Aimia\" or the \"Company\") today announced the final results of its substantial issuer bid (the \"Offers\") to purchase for cancellation all of its preferred shares (the \"Preferred Shares\") in consideration for 9.75% senior unsecured notes (the \"2030 Notes\").</p><p class=\"\">Based on the count provided by TMX Trust, the depository for the Offers, a total of 7,889,931 Preferred Shares were validly tendered. The total is comprised of:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Series 1: 4,528,157 shares, representing 89.1% of the issued and   outstanding shares of this series.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Series 3: 660,174 shares, representing 40.0% of the issued and   outstanding shares of this series.   </li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Series 4: 2,701,600 shares, representing 99.8% of the issued and   outstanding shares of this series. </li></ul><p class=\"\">Preferred Shares validly deposited by preferred shareholders as of January 30, 2025 have been taken up and paid for by the Company and Aimia issued $142,603,700 principal amount of 2030 Notes in consideration.</p><p class=\"\">Based on the number of preferred shares validly tendered and 2030 Notes issued in consideration, Aimia will generate approximately $6.4 million in annual cash savings when comparing the annual preferred dividends and Part VI.1 tax to the annual cash coupon interest payments. Under IFRS, Aimia expects to record a $53.7 million gain on the transaction, based on the exchange value of the 2030 Notes and the carrying value of the Preferred Shares exchanged.</p><p class=\"\">Aimia considers this transaction as accretive to holders of common shares as it (i) reduces cash outflows on an annual basis, (ii) increases the net asset value for holders of common shares by approximately $0.53 per share, inclusive of all transaction costs, based on the number of shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2024 of 95,413,317.</p><p class=\"\">The 2030 Notes will bear interest at an annual rate of 9.75% payable semi-annually in arrears on June 30 and December 31 in each year (or following Business Day) commencing on June 30, 2025. The 2030 Notes will mature on January 14, 2030. The 2030 Notes will not be listed on a securities exchange or quotation system and consequentially, there will be no market through which the 2030 Notes may be sold and depositing Preferred Shareholders may not be able to resell the 2030 Notes acquired under the Offers.</p><p class=\"\">Preferred Shares not tendered through the Offers will continue to be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and holders may expect to receive their quarterly distributions as customary.</p><p class=\"\">As specified in its issuer bid circular dated November 21, 2024 (the \"Circular\"), Aimia has the option to acquire the remainder of the Preferred Shares by way of a compulsory acquisition (\"Compulsory Acquisition\") if the Company takes up and pays for 90% or more of the Preferred Shares within 120 days of the date of the Offers. The Compulsory Acquisition option can be exercised by the Company by sending an offeror's notice to preferred shareholders who did not accept the Offers within 60 days after the expiry date (but in any event within 180 days after the date of the Offers).</p><p class=\"\">The Substantial Issuer Bid marks the first initiative introduced as a result of Aimia's strategic review process designed to unlock the Company's value. The Offers provide preferred shareholders with an opportunity to realize all or a portion of their investment in the Company based on (i) the limited liquidity and perpetual nature of the Preferred Shares, (ii) the higher annual yield the 2030 Notes will provide relative to the current dividend (annualized) of each series of Preferred Shares, (iii) the fixed maturity date of the 2030 Notes, and (iv) the accelerated liquidity available to holders of 2030 Notes in certain events. The Strategic Review Committee and the Board of Directors believe that the exchange of Preferred Shares for the 2030 Notes under the Offers for the purchase price (as detailed in the Offer Documents) represents an effective recapitalization of the Company and is in the best interests of the Company and its security holders.</p><p class=\"\">About Aimia</p><p class=\"\">Aimia Inc.  is a diversified company focused on unlocking the growth potential of its two global businesses, Bozzetto, a sustainable specialty chemicals company, and Cortland International, a rope and netting solutions company. Headquartered in Toronto, Aimia's priorities include monetizing its non-core investments, enhancing the value of our core holdings, and returning capital to its shareholders.
