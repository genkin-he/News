The U.S. accounted for only 5%-15% of Chinese exports of these products in 2024, he says. Home-appliance companies in China are also shifting their focus to developing countries with the potential for faster sales expansion, the analyst says. Midea Group and Haier Smart Home have a 5%-6% revenue exposure to the U.S., according to Morningstar estimates. The two companies could raise selling prices modestly and ramp up production in the U.S. to offset the tariff impact, Zhang adds. He expects the tariff hike to have a mid-single-digit impact on Midea's and Haier's earnings this year. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
