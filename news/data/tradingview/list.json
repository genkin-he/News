            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">BP  is hitting the brakes on its $1 billion green hydrogen and renewable fuels project in Kwinana, Australia, as financial pressures and policy delays take their toll. The project, designed to turn a former oil refinery into a biofuels and hydrogen hub, is now in limbo while BP waits for clarity on government subsidies. This comes as the company aggressively cuts costs, axing thousands of jobs and shelving 30 projects since June. Investors will be watching closely as BP rethinks its clean energy timeline while trying to keep capital efficiency in check.</p><p class=\"\">At the same time, BP is doubling down on oil. The company is reportedly on the verge of signing a $25 billion deal to redevelop Iraq's Kirkuk oil fields over the next 25 years. The project would boost crude production by 150,000 barrels per day, reinforcing BP's century-old footprint in the region. If finalized, the deal would mark a major win for Iraq, which has struggled to attract foreign investment amid years of war and political instability. With crude prices holding strong, BP appears to be hedging its betsscaling back renewables while securing long-term oil cash flow.</p><p class=\"\">For investors, this is a clear signal: BP is playing defense. Green energy projects are slowing, traditional oil investments are expanding, and the company is laser-focused on profitability. With earnings around the corner, the key question is whether BP's shift in priorities will pay offor if it's simply reacting to short-term pressures at the expense of long-term transformation.</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Megan Leonhardt and Nicholas Jasinski</p><p class=\"\">President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China could push consumer prices higher, dent U.S. and global economic growth, and create more challenges for the Federal Reserve.</p><p class=\"\">Trump plans to impose a 10% tariff on China and 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods, with the exception of Canadian energy imports, which will face a lower tariff rate of 10%. Tariffs on Mexico and Canada will be delayed by a month as negotiations continue, but levies on China are still set to take effect at midnight on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"\">Imports from all three countries account for just over 42% of all products and raw materials coming into the U.S. Trump's latest tariff proposal would take the effective tariff rate on all U.S. imports up to an average of 10% from less than 3%. The U.S. hasn't experienced this sort of increase since World War II.</p><p class=\"\">Economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimate that the proposed tariffs will drive up inflation by 0.6% in the short-term, and create a 0.2% drag on real gross domestic product growth. U.S. GDP will be around $200 billion lower than it would have been without the tariffs for the duration of Trump's second term in office, according to Peterson economists Warwick McKibbin and Marcus Noland. And that's before any tariff retaliation takes place, which all three countries have vowed to implement.</p><p class=\"\">The tariffs are likely to weigh on business investment, a key component of economic growth, writes Bernard Yaros, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. Even if the current proposed tariffs are \"watered down this year and eventually lifted,\" Yaros expects the threat alone could cut growth in the housing market and business investment in structures by one percentage point and 1.6 percentage points, respectively, this year.</p><p class=\"\">Morgan Stanley's economists estimate that the drag on real business investment could be as high as 2.2%.</p><p class=\"\">The effects of a trade war would be more severe for Canada and Mexico than the U.S., however, largely because exports to the U.S. account for a larger share of GDP for both countries than the U.S. Morgan Stanley economists expect a recession in Mexico if tariffs are implemented at their currently proposed levels. Mexico's GDP is expected to grow by 1.2% this year, and Canada's, by 1.8%, according to FactSet.</p><p class=\"\">Much of any U.S. cost increase caused by tariffs will be passed on to American consumers, a fact that President Trump seemed to acknowledge in a social media post on Sunday.</p><p class=\"\">\"The burden will fall disproportionally on low-income households,\" writes James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.</p><p class=\"\">That's because lower-income Americans tend to spend more of their income on physical goods relative to higher-income households, which spend more on services and experiences, neither of which are subject to tariffs.</p><p class=\"\">If consumers don't shift to American-made products from imports, and if producers pass through 100% of these tariffs, Knightley calculates that would result in increased spending of $835 for every man, woman and child in America. A family of four would have $3,342 in additional expenses annually, on average. While lower-income households account for a smaller share of overall consumer spending, the increased costs could lead to a broader pullback in spending.</p><p class=\"\">Companies could absorb all or part of the added cost of tariffs, but few seem willing to do so.</p><p class=\"\">\"One of the things that we've been asking [in surveys of] businesses is, if you're hit with a tariff, what are you likely to do?\" Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic said on Monday. \"What they've told us is they expect to pass it through 100%.\"</p><p class=\"\">If consumers rebel, he added, \"they may make a different decision. So experience will guide this in a pretty significant way.\"</p><p class=\"\">If Trump's tariffs are fully implemented, food and energy prices could feel the impact quickly; it would show up in the headline consumer price index as early as February, according to Citi economist Veronica Clark. More than a quarter of U.S. food imports are from Mexico, as are more than half of all vegetables, nuts, and fruits brought into the country. But it may take a bit longer, or roughly three months, until the tariffs on consumer goods start to take hold. That's what happened in 2018, when the first Trump administration placed tariffs on all imports of washing machines.</p><p class=\"\">If the tariffs are short-lived, as some expect, the effect on consumer prices could be minimal. Brian Gardner, Stifel's chief Washington policy strategist, believes that a negotiated settlement is the most likely outcome.</p><p class=\"\">\"The pretext of the tariffs was fentanyl, but in interviews, President Trump cited trade deficits,\" Gardner writes. \"This suggests that the administration is looking for a political deal. It could be on trade, it could be on fentanyl, but it seems like the administration wants to be able to claim some tangible benefits.\"</p><p class=\"\">History shows that poor economic outcomes typically have followed broad-based tariffs, writes Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital. While Trump has praised President McKinley's protectionist policies, DeQuadros notes that McKinley's tariff regime resulted in such poor economic outcomes — including bouts of inflation — and were so unpopular with the public that McKinley later repudiated the policy.</p><p class=\"\">For the Federal Reserve — already in wait-and-see mode regarding any near-term change in interest rates — tariffs' impact on policy decisions will depend on how long they remain in place, how much of the cost is passed through to consumers, and how other countries respond. In their recent public remarks, many Fed officials have described tariffs as a one-time increase in the price level, rather than a sustained source of inflationary pressure that would demand a response in the form of higher interest rates.</p><p class=\"\">Trump is presumably aware of the risk of igniting inflation via tariffs.</p><p class=\"\">\"Mr. Trump ran for President on a platform that included tariffs, but he also ran on lowering prices for consumers,\" wrote David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"The fact that the tariffs include a lower levy on energy imports from Canada suggests that the administration is aware of the potential conflict between the two goals. This also supports our view that a deal is the ultimate goal. The administration understands the political risk of higher prices.\"</p><p class=\"\">Write to Megan Leonhardt at megan.leonhardt@barrons.com and Nicholas Jasinski at nicholas.jasinski@barrons.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Venice, Florida, Feb.  04, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — LiveCare Inc. (OTCMKTS: LVCE), today announced the resolution of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice of allegations related to the Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act. The resolution was the result of a self-disclosure LiveCare made to the government in July 2023 and the company’s cooperation with the Department of Justice throughout its investigation.</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">In early 2023, the Company learned that certain business practices may have been out of compliance with Medicare rules governing the referral of patients for remote patient monitoring (RPM) services. In response, LiveCare engaged external healthcare enforcement attorneys to conduct an internal investigation. This thorough review identified several areas of potential risk to be addressed to ensure full compliance with Medicare rules and applicable regulations. LiveCare promptly disclosed the matter to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General. The disclosure outlined concerns about the Company’s marketing practices. LiveCare also implemented a series of corrective actions aimed at improving its operations. These efforts included significant enhancements and changes to the way the company acquires patients and bills for its RPM services.</li></ul><p class=\"\">“At LiveCare, we take compliance very seriously,” said Max Rockwell, CEO of LiveCare Inc. “When we identified areas where we fell short, we took immediate and transparent action by reporting the issues to the government and working diligently to implement necessary corrective measures. Our priority is always the wellbeing of our patients, and we have enhanced our internal compliance practices to monitor compliance with the law.”</p><p class=\"\">“We understand that trust is essential in healthcare, and our commitment to ethical business practices is unwavering,” Rockwell added. “In addition to fully cooperating with the Department of Justice and relevant authorities, we have implemented a comprehensive set of enhanced compliance measures. These steps will ensure that we continue to operate with the utmost integrity, providing the highest level of care to our patients.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About LiveCare</strong></p><p class=\"\">LiveCare remains committed to providing high-quality remote patient monitoring services to individuals with chronic conditions, including Type 2 diabetes.

The move keeps gold's positive momentum going, after it recorded net outflows in last week's trading, according to data from JPMorgan Global Commodities Research. The firm says that for the week ended Jan. 31, open interest in precious metals fell 4.6%, or by $11.3 billion. The firm attributes the decline to outflows in gold contracts, but uncertainty around trade tariffs is pushing investors back into the safe haven asset. Year-to-date, continuous gold futures have risen nearly 9%. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",
