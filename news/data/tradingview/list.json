The move keeps gold's positive momentum going, after it recorded net outflows in last week's trading, according to data from JPMorgan Global Commodities Research. The firm says that for the week ended Jan. 31, open interest in precious metals fell 4.6%, or by $11.3 billion. The firm attributes the decline to outflows in gold contracts, but uncertainty around trade tariffs is pushing investors back into the safe haven asset. Year-to-date, continuous gold futures have risen nearly 9%. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1252 ET - Tariffs would certainly dampen Ball's current outlook, Chief Executive Dan Fisher says on a call with analysts. The aluminum-can maker has spent the better part of the last few weeks renegotiating deals with its Chinese aluminum suppliers in an attempt to mitigate a $40 million to $50 million issue, he says: \"I think we've got that resolved down to a couple million dollars.\" The larger concern now revolves around consumer sentiment. Consumers are already pretty stressed, Fisher says, adding that higher costs stemming from a 25% tariff would stifle demand and be a headwind to growth. Shares fall 8% after Ball reports a decline in 4Q sales and logs a loss. (connor.hart@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1149 ET - Base metal prices rise, with LME three-month copper up 0.5% at $9,158.50 a metric ton and LME three-month aluminum up 0.6% at $2,636.50 a ton. The market has bounced back from losses incurred by President Trump's proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which have been postponed a month after last-minute agreements on Monday. An additional 10% China tariff has proceeded. This has eased market worries of reduced industrial growth and demand. Canada and Mexico are significant suppliers to the U.S. across the whole base-metals complex, ranging from around 20% of copper imports to nearly half of its aluminum imports. News of the delay also sent the U.S. dollar lower, a tailwind for metals as it becomes cheaper for international buyers to purchase dollar-denominated commodities. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">1141 ET - Gold futures rise, having set a fresh record slightly earlier in the session. Futures are up 0.5% at $2,871.60 a troy ounce, having peaked at $2,874.50 in European late afternoon trading. The precious metal has traded in a relatively narrow range, with rising U.S. bond yields and a stronger dollar limiting the upward rally, XS.com's Rania Gule says in a note. That said, concerns about potential economic fallout from President Trump's tariffs and other inflationary policies provide strong support for gold as a safe-haven asset, Gule writes. The overall upward trend for gold remains intact, and any corrective pullbacks should be seen as buying opportunities as supportive factors haven't fundamentally changed, Gule says. As markets remain uncertain, gold will likely stay a focus for investors both as a hedge and an investment opportunity, Gule adds.

Kennedy Jr. clears a Senate Finance Committee vote on his prospective leadership of Health and Human Services. While Kennedy said he supported vaccines in his Senate testimony, aiming to calm concerns over some of his past criticisms, he reiterated concerns about processed foods, which he's blamed for exacerbating chronic disease. Kraft Heinz recently down 2.3%, with other food stocks like Campbell's, JM Smucker and General Mills down around 2%.

The Denver home builder adds that it's continuing to work with its suppliers but stressed that things remain fluid. \"Typically suppliers will keep a number of months of supply on hand. So if this is just a short-term negotiating tactic, the new home builders may not even feel it,\" says Francescon. While the U.S. paused plans for 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for one month, a 10% levy on imports from China went into effect today. Shares rise 2.2% to $76.29, recouping most of the previous sessions losses.

Traders appear to be pulling back from the steep selling seen to start the week, with contract limits in today's session extended to 6 cents a pound after the limit-down close Monday, following a drop of 4 cents a pound. While the hog market recalibrates amid tariff turmoil, there exists fundamental pressure points for hog demand. Pork carcass cutout prices shed 94 cents per hundredweight on Monday, according to USDA data, following a strong start to 2025 pricewise. Live cattle futures are down 0.2%.

Trump's decision to delay tariffs on his U.S. neighbors could reflect domestic backlash over potential economic pain for U.S. consumers but the same isn't necessarily true for the EU, he says. Trump can afford to keep EU tariffs in place for a prolonged period, making the bloc feel some pain before striking a deal. \"With all this in mind, we are somewhat sceptical that the euro is bound for a major rally.\" The euro rises 0.2% to $1.0364. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0956 ET - As the threat of U.S. tariffs on imports from Canada continues to loom, the ongoing uncertainty makes it challenging for small business owners to plan and make decisions on their operations, warns the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. The association, which represents about 100,000 members, said that as both countries catch their breath Canada still needs to focus on critical changes needed to prepare for the future. This, the federation suggests, means taking the opportunity now to bring in policies that improve the investment climate, reduce taxes, slash red tape and break down internal trade barriers in the country to ensure Canada is prepared no matter what external threats come its way. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)</p><p class=\"\">0952 ET - CBOT grain futures are mixed, with traders maintaining a reserved approach as China responds to Trump tariffs with retaliatory measures of its own targeting energy exports among other things. The tariffs make no mention of raw soybeans, but traders are wondering nonetheless about whether China will curb its purchases. \"Remember, we are looking to see if there is any new commodity buying by China, versus just 'maneuvering to avoid tariffs,\" says Naomi Blohm of Total Farm Marketing in a note. The USDA announced a new flash sale of corn to South Korea for 132,000 metric tons. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0940 ET - With tariffs paused but still looming, Canada's automotive industry continues to stress the integrated nature of the industry in North America and the damage levies could cause. The Canadian Automotive Partnership Council in a meeting with Canadian lawmakers warned tariffs pose an existential threat to the industry in Canada and the U.S. and costs ultimately being borne by consumers. The industry body notes bilateral automotive trade is balanced, with Canadian exports to the U.S. at C$82 billion and imports at C$79 billion in 2023. And it stresses Canadian-made vehicles don't pose a threat to U.S. automotive jobs or production mandates: fewer than 10% of vehicles sold in the U.S. are produced in Canada, whereas the U.S. assembles about half of the vehicles sold in Canada and exports more vehicles to Canada than to any other country.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics' Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report showed that job openings, a measure of labor demand, slid to 7.6 million on the last day of December. </p><p class=\"\">In afternoon trading, the benchmark 10-year yield was last down 2.8 basis points (bps) at 4.515% , after dropping on Monday to its lowest since mid-December.</p><p class=\"\">    \"I still think the 10-year yield could hit below 4% later this year, but that's really predicated on a slowing economy,\" said Gillum. \"If data continues to hold up, there's no reason that we can't trade between 4.50% to 5%.\"  </p><p class=\"\">    U.S. 30-year yields also slid to 4.751%, down 2 bps (US30YT=RR).  </p><p class=\"\">    On the short end of the curve, U.S. two-year yields, which are tied to the Federal Reserve's policy moves, fell 5.1 bps to 4.214% (US2YT=RR).</p><p class=\"\">Also helping push the two-year yield down was a report showing new orders for U.S.-manufactured goods dropped 0.9% in December after a revised 0.8% decline in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders would fall 0.7% after a previously reported 0.4% drop in November.</p><p class=\"\">The yield curve, meanwhile, flattened modestly on Tuesday, with the gap between two-year and 10-year yields at 29.7 bps (US2US10=TWEB), from 30.2 bps in the previous session. The curve hit its narrowest since late December on Monday after the initial tariff announcements.</p><p class=\"\">Investors have been selling the long end of the curve, demanding higher compensation, or the so-called \"term premium,\" in exchange for dealing with policy uncertainty over a longer time horizon. The current term premium for U.S. 10-year notes stood at 72 bps, according to estimates from the St. Louis Fed, compared with about 45 bps in early December.</p><p class=\"\">\"You expect yields to fall further, but that lack of clarity on policy is really giving intermediate and long-term investors more pause,\" said Chip Hughey, managing director of fixed income, at Truist Advisory Services in Richmond, Virginia.</p><p class=\"\">U.S. rate futures, meanwhile, have priced in about 46 bps of easing this year, or nearly two rate cuts of 25 bps each. That was up from 41 bps late on Monday, according to LSEG calculations, with the first rate cut likely happening at the Fed's June or July policy meeting.</p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:852.0000000000001px;aspect-ratio:1.4200000000000002\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3OV0WT-1b2c688746dc6282bf8dbbfb9333c3db-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt='A line chart titled \"US yield curve\" that tracks the metric over time.' class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3OV0WT-1b2c688746dc6282bf8dbbfb9333c3db-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#fafafb\"/></picture></div><figcaption class=\"caption-S5VA5POt\"><span class=\"copyright-S5VA5POt\">Thomson Reuters</span><span class=\"description-S5VA5POt\">US yield curve</span></figcaption></figure></span></p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Weston, Missouri, Feb.  04, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — In step with continued growth and increased consumer demand, the Weston, Missouri-based Holladay Distillery has broken ground on its new Rickhouse D, its fourth in a century of developing the only ironclad rickhouses in the state of Missouri. A giant in Missouri distilling history, Holladay built its first three on-site rickhouses in the early 1900s, 1930, and 1950. Seventy-five years after its last rickhouse, 2025’s development will mark Holladay’s latest stage of growth in its distilling legacy that dates back to 1856.</p><p class=\"\">Holladay’s Rickhouse D will be constructed over the course of eight to nine months in partnership with the St. Joseph-based construction company Al J. Mueller. Holladay’s active rickhouses span roughly 9,000 square feet and offer barrel capacity between 10,000 and 12,000. Rickhouse D will feature an 11,000-barrel capacity to maintain consistency across each bourbon. Holladay Distillery remains the only distillery in Missouri to age bourbon in ironclad rickhouses.</p><p class=\"\">“We’re proud to continue making Missouri history by expanding our capacity to distill, age, and distribute premium bourbon to a wider audience,” said Holladay Distillery's president, Mick Harris. “Rickhouse D is a significant investment into our future, as well as a commitment to continuing to meet growing demands for Holladay Bourbon.”</p><p class=\"\">The business took a bourbon distilling hiatus from 1985 to 2015 to focus on other spirits within its portfolio. In 2015, Holladay installed new equipment in its original stillhouse and began making bourbon onsite again for the first time in 30 years. The original 1856 Holladay mash bill was used for production, and after six years of aging, Ben Holladay Bourbon was released in 2022. In 2016, Holladay added a new mash bill to the lineup that included soft red wheat as an ingredient which led to the release of Holladay Soft Red Wheat Bourbon in 2023. Heightened demand for both products ultimately drove the distillery to expand its capacity for rickhouse aging.</p><p class=\"\">In addition to its flagship brands, Holladay Soft Red Wheat and Ben Holladay Bourbon, Holladay offers a Rickhouse Proof, and One Barrel Bourbons which are both bottled at the exact proof from the bourbon barrel yield after a minimum of six years’ aging in one of the original Holladay Rickhouses. Holladay also offers its Ancient Cave Collection, a series of bourbon aged in experimental barrels for a secondary finish. Each Holladay collection will benefit from the expanded capacity offered by the new Rickhouse D.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About Holladay Distillery</strong></p><p class=\"\">Originally founded in 1856 by Ben Holladay, Holladay Distillery produces Missouri bourbon steeped in history, including Holladay Soft Red Wheat and Ben Holladay Bourbon, which uses an original recipe more than 160 years old. Located in Weston, Missouri, Holladay Distillery offers tours with the opportunity to explore fascinating local history and to experience Real Missouri Bourbon being made.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">    U.S. diner chain Waffle House has added a 50-cent surcharge for every egg in a customer’s order, the company said in a statement posted in its restaurants on Monday.</p><p class=\"\">The fee is temporary, the company said in a statement Tuesday, and is a response to a “dramatic increase in egg prices” caused by bird flu outbreaks.</p><p class=\"\">\"While we hope these price fluctuations will be short-lived we cannot predict how long this shortage will last,” the statement read. </p><p class=\"\">The privately-held chain is known for its low prices. A standard American breakfast with two eggs is sold for $7.75 in Norcross, Georgia, where the company is headquartered. That meal is now $1 more expensive.</p><p class=\"\">The price of U.S. wholesale eggs hit an all-time high in December, according to commodity data firm Expana, with a dozen eggs going for $5.57 in the Midwest and $8.85 in California.</p><p class=\"\">The main factor driving egg prices higher is damage to the laying flock from bird flu. The virus wiped out more than 20 million chickens in the U.S. last quarter, data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows, the highest toll since the beginning of the outbreak in 2022.</p><p class=\"\">The chain said it has 2,100 locations across the United States. Its website says it serves 272 million eggs every year.</p></span></div>",
