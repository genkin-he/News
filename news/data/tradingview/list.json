UK exports to the US are less than 2% of GDP and those to China less than 1%.” In addition, “Trump seems in no rush to hit the UK with tariffs, also considering its goods trade balance with the US is arguably negligible.\"</p><p class=\"\">The British currency is also benefiting from efforts by Prime Minister Keir Starmer to strengthen EU-UK defense.</p><p class=\"\">That was the official reasoning for a trip to Brussels, but Pesole notes that “markets may be double reading an intent by Starmer to gradually reconnect with the EU politically. That is inarguably positive for sterling, which remains highly sensitive to any development that can improve a worsening growth outlook.”</p><p class=\"\">Indeed, it's not all good news for the pound. Higher borrowing costs are eating into the fiscal headroom for the UK Chancellor. On Thursday, the Bank of England is also expected to deliver “a dovish rate cut.”</p><p class=\"\">And that means that sterling may not advance back to the $0.8450 level reached against the euro in January anytime soon, Pesole said. </p><p class=\"\">(Karen Brettell) </p><p class=\"\">     *****       </p><p class=\"\">FOR TUESDAY'S EARLIER LIVE MARKETS POSTS:</p><p class=\"\">CAREFUL, IS THAT THE FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY, OR PANDORA'S BOX? - CLICK HERE</p><p class=\"\">TWO-FER TUESDAY: JOLTS, FACTORY ORDERS - CLICK HERE</p><p class=\"\">META SHARES POISED FOR RECORD WINNING STREAK ON FACEBOOK'S 21ST BIRTHDAY - CLICK HERE</p><p class=\"\">WALL STREET GAINS EARLY; PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES RALLIES - CLICK HERE</p><p class=\"\">NASDAQ COMPOSITE: LOTS OF CHOP AS TRIES TO AVOID A BIGGER DROP - CLICK HERE</p><p class=\"\">WATCH OUT INVESTORS, IT'S THE YEAR OF THE SNAKE - CLICK HERE</p><p class=\"\">EQUITIES AND THE EURO: IT'S COMPLICATED - CLICK HERE</p><p class=\"\">A \"FASCINATING\" EARNINGS SEASON AHEAD FOR UK BANKS - CLICK HERE</p><p class=\"\">BACK TO EARNINGS - CLICK HERE</p><p class=\"\">EUROPE BEFORE THE BELL: HERE WE GO AGAIN - CLICK HERE </p></span></div>",

Sweeping tariffs Trump ordered on Saturday on Mexico and Canada were paused a month while tariffs were being imposed on China, which retaliated with levies of its own.</p><p class=\"\">Some investors have been preparing for the potential for tariffs that Trump vowed to put in place during his campaign, including moving to assets seen as less vulnerable to a trade dispute or geopolitical uncertainty more broadly. </p><p class=\"\">With stocks trading at lofty price-to-earnings ratios, investors also said the tariff news could warrant more caution for equities and create volatility in the near term.</p><p class=\"\">    At Nomura Capital Management, where stretched valuations for equities and other risk assets had already spurred the firm to become more defensive in recent months, the tariffs were further reason to be cautious, said Matt Rowe, head of portfolio management and cross-asset strategies.  </p><p class=\"\">With the tariff situation, \"it's really hard to see exactly where it's going to go, how long it will last,\" Rowe said. \"But it's easy to say that this is not good for growth, it's not good for consumer spending, and it's likely to have a negative impact on earnings.\"</p><p class=\"\">     The tariff developments caused big swings in equities and currencies on Monday, which retraced initial moves after news of the pauses on the Mexico and Canada tariffs.</p><p class=\"\">\"The threat of tariffs is live and that's unlikely to go away,\" said Michael Medeiros, macro strategist at Wellington Management, adding that the uncertainty could force the firm to explore more tactical, short-term trades.</p><p class=\"\">PROFIT SQUEEZE</p><p class=\"\">Analysts estimate that tariffs could drive up inflation while weighing on economic growth and corporate profits. Goldman Sachs strategists said Trump's tariffs announced on Saturday - 25% on Canada and Mexico and 10% on China - would reduce their S&amp;P 500 earnings forecasts by roughly 2-3%, while strategists at BofA Global Research said the earnings hit could be as much as 8%.</p><p class=\"\">\"If company managements decide to absorb the higher input costs, then profit margins would be squeezed,\" the Goldman equity strategists said in a note on Sunday. \"If companies pass along the higher costs to...end customers, then sales volumes may suffer.\"</p><p class=\"\">The onset of tariffs raised the risk of an S&amp;P 500 pullback of at least 5% early in the year, Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note on Sunday.</p><p class=\"\">Strategists at UBS Global Wealth Management on Monday maintained their view the S&amp;P 500 would end the year roughly 10% above current levels, but said \"tariffs are likely to represent an overhang on markets and contribute to volatility, at least until investors gain greater clarity on the path and destination of U.S. trade policy.\"</p><p class=\"\">The UBS strategists recommended gold as \"an effective hedge\" against geopolitical and inflation risks. </p><p class=\"\">Robeco added to its positions in safe havens gold and U.S. Treasuries late last week because of concerns about market complacency with respect to tariffs, said Colin Graham, the firm's head of multi-asset strategies.</p><p class=\"\">\"We’re in a worse position than we were on Friday,\" Graham said as he watched the initial market reaction unfold on Monday.</p><p class=\"\">FLUID SITUATION</p><p class=\"\">While the tariff threats lent support to some strategists' current allocations and encouraged others to make changes, many warned against knee-jerk reactions to Trump's announcements.</p><p class=\"\">Morgan Stanley equity strategists said the tariffs reinforced their preference for services industries, including financials, software, and media and entertainment, saying in a note on Monday that \"we would expect the market to rotate further toward services given recent trade policy implementation.\"</p><p class=\"\">Concerns about risks from tariffs and geopolitical uncertainty more broadly have led Manulife Investment Management in recent weeks to move into more defensive equity areas and reduce exposure to riskier high-yield credit, said Nathan Thooft, chief investment officer and senior portfolio manager at Manulife.</p><p class=\"\">\"But we’re advocating for people to remain fairly calm,\" Thooft said. \"This is still very fluid and the reality is we don’t know what the policies will be.\"</p><p class=\"\">Baker Avenue Wealth Management had been underweight healthcare stocks coming into 2025 but added exposure to the group in recent weeks because it seems to be relatively immune to tariff risk, said King Lip, the firm's chief strategist. Still, Lip said he thinks Trump recognizes the concerns a trade war brings for the economy and markets, so the situation will be \"ratcheted down in a reasonable amount of time.\"</p><p class=\"\">        Indeed, many investors remained doubtful that Trump would allow the tariff dispute to spiral into a full-blown trade war that severely damages asset prices. </p><p class=\"\">Spencer Hakimian, CEO of Tolou Capital Management, a New York-based macro hedge fund, said he was not making any changes to his investment portfolio based on the tariff announcements.</p><p class=\"\">“Trump is bluffing,\" Hakimian said. \"Fade all the noise.\"</p></span></div>",

The company's U.S. business jumped 52% from a year earlier. \"Our business results continue to astound, demonstrating our deepening position at the center of the (artificial intelligence) revolution. Our early insights surrounding the commoditization of large language models have evolved from theory to fact,\" said CEO Alex Karp. For the first quarter, Palantir said it expects revenue of $858 million to $862 million, up 36% from 2024 at the midpoint and better than Wall Street estimates of $799 million.</p><p class=\"\">Tesla  was up 0.2% after shares of the electric-vehicle giant slumped 5.2% on Monday. The stock closed lower after it was announced that tariffs levied on Mexico by the U.S. would be delayed by a month but before President Donald Trump struck a similar deal with Canada. The electric-vehicle maker assembles all its vehicles for the U.S. market in the U.S. but about 15% of the parts in a Model Y sold in the U.S. come from Mexico.</p><p class=\"\">Shares of Nvidia, the leading maker of artificial-intelligence chips, were up 2.3%.  Nvidia declined 2.8% on Monday as Wall Street gauged the potential effects of the Trump administration's tariffs on chip companies and amid continued worries over AI advancements made by China's DeepSeek.</p><p class=\"\">Super Micro Computer rose 6.1%. The maker of AI servers said it would be providing a fiscal second-quarter \" business update\" on Feb. 11. The Nasdaq Stock Market told the company in November that it wasn't in compliance with a listing rule requiring timely filing of reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In early December, the company said it expected to file its delayed financial statements by Feb. 25.</p><p class=\"\">PepsiCo posted fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.96 a share, beating analysts' estimates of $1.94 but the stock fell 1.8% after revenue declined 0.2% from a year earlier to $27.78 billion and missed expectations of $27.89 billion. Shares fell 4.2%.</p><p class=\"\">Shares of Spotify Technology jumped 10% after the audio-streaming company added more premium subscribers in the fourth quarter than Wall Street expected, helping revenue top estimates.</p><p class=\"\">Merck fell 11% after the drug maker reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings that beat analysts' estimates but issued guidance for f2025 that missed expectations. Merck said it expects 2025 adjusted earnings of $8.88 to $9.03 a share, below consensus of $9.21.</p><p class=\"\">Pfizer was down 2.1. The company reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 63 cents a share, beating analysts' forecasts of 46 cents, and the company reaffirmed guidance for 2025.</p><p class=\"\">PayPal was down 9.4%. The fintech beat fourth-quarter earnings and sales estimates, and said total payment volume rose 7% in the quarter, while payment transactions decreased 3%.</p><p class=\"\">Estée Lauder, the luxury beauty brand, slumped 18% after it issued weak earnings guidance, said it expects to cut between 5,800 and 7,000 positions as part of a two-year restructuring plan, and would record more than $1 billion in pretax charges on employee-related costs.</p><p class=\"\">Clorox reported a 15% drop in fiscal second-quarter sales to $1.69 billion, and said it now expects fiscal-year sales to fall 1% to 2%, down from a prior outlook for sales to be flat to down 2%. Shares of the cleaning-products maker were down 5.7%.</p><p class=\"\">Earnings reports are expected after the closing bell Tuesday from Alphabet, Advanced Micro Devices, Chipotle Mexican Grill, and Amgen.</p><p class=\"\">Alphabet rose 2.3% ahead of fourth-quarter earnings from the parent of Google. Wall Street expects Alphabet to report earnings of $2.13 a share on revenue of $96.7 billion, up from per-share profit of $1.64 on revenue of $86.3 billion a year earlier.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">Partnership aims to dramatically increase social impact for tens of thousands of small to midsize nonprofits by 2030</p><p class=\"\">CUMBERLAND, ME AND SEATTLE, WA / ACCESS Newswire / February 4, 2025 / The Philanthropy Network (philanthropy.network), a LinkedIn-based nonprofit fundraising community with over 115,000 members, announced today a new partnership with the Altruist Impact Accelerator (altruistaccelerator.org) to deliver leadership, management, and fundraising guidance to its members to enable them to dramatically increase their revenue and social impact.</p><p class=\"\">\"Many small to midsize nonprofits are doing incredible work, but the reality is that many are struggling just to keep the lights on and make payroll, let alone grow their impact,\" says Brad Smith, Ed.M., Founder of the Philanthropy Network. \"When we talk to our members, we hear the same concern again and again-they're stretched thin, facing constant hurdles, and looking for more than just one-off advice. They're looking for practical, proven ways to grow and advance their mission.\"</p><p class=\"\">\"After years of searching, we believe we've found a solution: the Altruist Impact Accelerator-a program that's proven its ability to transform organizations into scalable agents of change. Together, we aim to reach 25,000 nonprofits over the next five years through their accessible, affordable platform. It could not come at a better time, and if we do this right, we will make a transformative impact and unleash a wave of social progress.\"</p><p class=\"\">The Altruist Impact Accelerator, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in 2022, is a low-cost, open-access learning community that provides nonprofit executives, staff, and board members a clear, step-by-step pathway for planning, financing, and executing ambitious social change efforts, regardless of mission or location.</p><p class=\"\">\"We've been working with hundreds of nonprofits around the world over the past 15 years to develop this integrated learning curriculum,\" says Donald Summers, Altruist Accelerator Founder and Executive Director. \"Until now, nonprofit leaders have had to piece together disconnected advice on governance, program evaluation, fundraising, hiring, team building, and other key management areas. What we've done is integrate everything into a step-by-step process that any organization can follow to dramatically increase their performance and service delivery. The Accelerator includes tools, templates, real-world examples and a supportive community of experts to help with implementation. This is what the social sector needs: a self-paced, low-cost solution to scaling impact.\"</p><p class=\"\">\"We used the Altruist process to create levels of educational success for foster youth that were considered impossible,\" says Janis Avery, former Executive Director of Treehouse and Vice Chair of the Altruist Accelerator Board of Directors, whose story is featured in the book \"Scaling Altruism: A Proven Pathway for Accelerating Nonprofit Growth and Impact\"(Wiley, 2024). \"We worked for years with many different experts to improve the stubbornly low rates of high school graduation among foster youth. It wasn't until we applied the practices detailed in ‘Scaling Altruism' that we not just moved the needle, but closed the graduation gap almost entirely. We hope other nonprofit leaders take advantage of this proven approach.\"</p><p class=\"\">\"I encourage those who react with skepticism to the Accelerator's bold promise of nonprofit transformation to consider the program's track record,\" says Akhtar Badshah, Distinguished Professor of Social Impact at the University of Washington and Board Chair of the Altruist Accelerator. \"This methodology has been painstakingly developed over two decades of practice. It delivers a median annual increase of revenue and program impact of 25%. It's not easy, and it is only for tenacious nonprofit leaders ready to learn a new set of entrepreneurial practices. But it works. This is a toolkit for nonprofit growth and impact.\"</p><p class=\"\">The Accelerator's self-paced training is provided in an online community where nonprofit staff, leaders and board members follow a carefully sequenced series of organizational development and growth practices and apply them to their unique organizational contexts. They develop business plans, financial models, pitch decks, program evaluation dashboards, and other tools that are taught in leading business schools and for-profit accelerators, all adapted for use in the nonprofit sector.</p><p class=\"\">\"Combine all the rigor of a Harvard MBA with a self-paced, supportive process tailored for busy executives at small nonprofits, and you have an idea of what we are doing,\" Summers says. \"There is nothing like it. The more nonprofits that follow this program, the more social problems we will solve.\"</p><p class=\"\">Suited for organizations ranging in size from start-ups to about $25 million in annual funding, the Accelerator is now open to any nonprofit employee, executive or board member. A description of the training program and a direct link to a free 7-day trial may be found at altruistaccelerator.org.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About:</strong> Brad Smith is the Founder of the Philanthropy Network, (https://philanthropy.network/), a community of 115,000 nonprofit professionals providing guidance, wisdom and connection for its members.

Here's what you need to know:</p><p class=\"\">PROFIT: The routers and switches equipment company is expected to post a net profit of $113.4 million, or 28 cents a share. This compares with a reported profit of $124.3 million, or 38 cents a share, for the year-ago period.</p><p class=\"\">ADJUSTED EARNINGS: Stripping out one-time items, the company's earnings per share are expected to come in at 57 cents, according to FactSet.</p><p class=\"\">REVENUE: Revenue is expected to rise to $1.39 billion, according to FactSet. This compares with reported revenue of $1.36 billion for the same period last year.</p><p class=\"\">The stock has fallen 10% over the past three months.</p><p class=\"\">WHAT TO WATCH:</p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Look for comments around the pending $14 billion deal with Hewlett Packard Enterprise for the company to acquire Juniper. Last week, the Justice Department sued to block the deal, which would create a combined company to potentially rival Cisco Systems, the current leader in wireless networking for large companies. Regulators said the tie-up would significantly reduce competition.</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">Investors will want to know how HPE and Juniper will challenge the DoJ's lawsuit. The companies say the DoJ's claim that the WLAN market is composed of three primary players is \"disconnected from market realities.\" The company said it \"will vigorously defend against the Department of Justice's overreaching interpretation of antitrust laws and will demonstrate how this transaction will provide customers with greater innovation and choice, positively change the dynamics in the networking market by enhancing competition, and strengthen the backbone of U.S. networking infrastructure.\"</li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\">See what the companies have to say about demand and where product orders stood in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, Chief Executive Rami Rahim said Juniper saw particularly robust orders from its cloud customers in support of front-end and back-end AI networking initiatives.</li></ul><p class=\"\">Write to Sabela Ojea at sabela.ojea@wsj.com; @sabelaojeaguix</p></span></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Kate King</p><p class=\"\">Amazon.com, the largest e-commerce retailer in the U.S., is stumbling in its efforts to compete in the bricks-and-mortar world.</p><p class=\"\">The company in 2018 launched the Amazon Go convenience store, where customers can grab a latte, bagel or turkey sandwich and walk out without waiting in line to pay. Amazon charges them electronically.</p><p class=\"\">But with the Amazon Go store in Woodland Hills, Calif., closing this month, the retailer has shrunk its Go portfolio by about half since early 2023, to 16 stores in four states. Instead, Amazon is focusing on licensing its \"Just Walk Out\" technology to other retailers, while it focuses its bricks-and-mortar ambitions on grocery stores.</p><p class=\"\">This is hardly Amazon's only misfire in the physical-store universe. It has closed dozens of its other branded retail stores in recent years, including bookstores, fashion outlets and its \"4-star\" locations stocked with bestselling items from its website.</p><p class=\"\">After a decadelong experiment with bricks-and-mortar stores, Amazon's dominance online has yet to translate into a successful strategy for connecting with shoppers in the real world, retail brokers and landlords said.</p><p class=\"\">\"They keep testing these concepts thinking one of them is going to connect with the consumer in a big way,\" said Jeff Edison, chief executive of Phillips Edison &amp; Co., a real-estate investor that owns grocery-anchored shopping centers. \"But can you think of any examples where they've actually done the bricks-and-mortar retail well? I can't.\"</p><p class=\"\">Amazon Go stores were launched to develop technology that speeds up the buying process while saving on labor costs. They use cameras and sensors to track customer purchases instead of a traditional checkout counter.</p><p class=\"\">But reducing the number of employees available to help customers and giving priority to credit-card payments over cash limits sales and makes the shopping experience more cumbersome, said Nick Egelanian, president of retail-advisory firm SiteWorks Retail.</p><p class=\"\">\"I don't think they really understand retail,\" Egelanian said. \"Running warehouses and shipping stuff efficiently is not the same as greeting a customer and saying, 'May I help you?'\"</p><p class=\"\">An Amazon spokeswoman said Go store employees greet customers at the door, restock shelves and are available to answer questions.</p><p class=\"\">While certain locations work better than others, the company continues to invest in its Go stores, including a recent redesign of its suburban store in Mill Creek, Wash., where it added more items such as made-to-order pizza. Amazon also opened a new Go store in Bellevue, Wash., last summer.</p><p class=\"\">\"Amazon aims to provide customers outstanding selection, value, and convenience when shopping for groceries and everyday essentials both online and in physical stores,\" Amazon spokeswoman Jessica Martin said.</p><p class=\"\">And while Amazon is tops for online revenue, its sales at bricks-and-mortar stores, including Whole Foods Market, have grown annually since 2021 as well as in the first nine months of 2024, according to the company's financial filings. Net sales in the third quarter of 2024 topped $5.2 billion, compared with about $61.4 billion at Amazon's online store.</p><p class=\"\">But Amazon Go competes in a crowded field. There are more than 152,000 convenience stores in the U.S., according to industry group NACS, many of which also sell coffee, alcohol and freshly prepared food.</p><p class=\"\">Amazon seemed to hedge its bets on Go from the start, making sure it wasn't locked into locations long term.</p><p class=\"\">The company negotiated hard for short-term leases or those with early-exit provisions, said Ed Coury, senior managing director at retail-advisory firm RCS Real Estate Advisors, who worked on a deal to open a 4-Star location at the Westfield Topanga mall in California. He calls that a \"risk averse\" approach to real estate.</p><p class=\"\">Developing and testing its Just Walk Out technology capabilities was a driving reason behind Amazon's rollout of its Go concept, Coury said, and as the technology improved the stores were less necessary.</p><p class=\"\">Amazon now licenses its Just Walk Out technology to more than 200 retailers, including colleges and universities, sports arenas, hospitals and airports. This allows it to profit by marketing the technology without the cost burden of operating a store.</p><p class=\"\">\"It was an investment well spent in developing technology,\" Coury said. \"But the growth plans that they had for that brand are over.\"</p><p class=\"\">Amazon's bricks-and-mortar retail strategy now seems to be focused on its grocery portfolio.</p><p class=\"\">The company acquired Whole Foods Market for roughly $13.5 billion in 2017 and last week announced that the grocer's chief executive, Jason Buechel, is now in charge of all grocery operations for Amazon, including its Fresh and Go stores.</p><p class=\"\">Amazon is moving forward with plans to open more locations for Amazon Fresh, which offers a more mass-market selection with often cheaper prices than upscale Whole Foods, after pausing expansion to overhaul the in-store experience. The stores have replaced its Just Walk Out technology with \"dash carts,\" where shoppers scan items before placing them in the cart.</p><p class=\"\">Amazon's changes to its Fresh stores have improved the shopping experience there, Egelanian said, though he feels the banner is still searching for a niche in the crowded grocery landscape.</p><p class=\"\">Martin said that \"providing customers with groceries and everyday essentials online and in store is a top priority for Amazon, and we plan to continue investing and innovating for customers in this area.\"</p><p class=\"\">Write to Kate King at kate.king@wsj.com</p></span></div>",
