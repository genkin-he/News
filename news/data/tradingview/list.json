The company's U.S. business jumped 52% from a year earlier. \"Our business results continue to astound, demonstrating our deepening position at the center of the (artificial intelligence) revolution. Our early insights surrounding the commoditization of large-language models have evolved from theory to fact,\" said CEO Alex Karp. For the first quarter, Palantir said it expects revenue of $858 million to $862 million, up 36% from 2024 at the midpoint, and better than Wall Street estimates of $799 million.</p><p class=\"\">Tesla  was up 0.9% after shares of the electric-vehicle maker slumped 5.2% on Monday. The stock closed lower after it was announced that tariffs levied on Mexico by the U.S. would be delayed by a month but before President Donald Trump struck a similar deal with Canada. Tesla makes all its EVs for the U.S. market in the U.S., but about 15% of the parts in a Model Y sold in the U.S. come from Mexico.</p><p class=\"\">Shares of Nvidia, the leading maker of artificial-intelligence chips, were up 2.2%.  Nvidia declined 2.8% on Monday as Wall Street gauged the potential effects of the Trump administration's tariffs on chip companies, and amid continued worries over AI advancements made by China's DeepSeek.</p><p class=\"\">Super Micro Computer rose 9.7%. The maker of AI servers said it would be providing a fiscal second-quarter \" business update\" on Feb. 11. The Nasdaq Stock Market told the company in November that it wasn't in compliance with a listing rule requiring timely filing of reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In early December, the company said it expected to file its delayed financial statements by Feb. 25.</p><p class=\"\">PepsiCo posted fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.96, beating analysts' estimates for $1.94, but the stock fell 1.8% after revenue declined 0.2% from a year earlier to $27.78 billion, and missed expectations of $27.89 billion. Shares fell 4.6%.</p><p class=\"\">Shares of Spotify Technology jumped 12% after the audio-streaming company added more premium subscribers in the fourth quarter than Wall Street expected, helping revenue top estimates.</p><p class=\"\">Merck fell 10% after the drug maker reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings that beat analysts' estimates but provided guidance that missed expectations. Merck said it expects 2025 adjusted earnings per share of $8.88 to $9.03, below consensus for $9.21.</p><p class=\"\">Pfizer was down 1.6%. The pharmaceutical company reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 63 cents, beating analysts' forecasts of 46 cents, and reaffirmed guidance for 2025. Shares fell Tuesday after a Senate panel voted to advance the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to serve as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p class=\"\">PayPal Holdings declined 12%. The fintech beat fourth-quarter earnings and sales estimates, and said total payment volume rose 7% in the quarter, while payment transactions decreased 3%.</p><p class=\"\">Estée Lauder slumped 16% after the luxury beauty brand issued weak earnings guidance, announced it would eliminate thousands of positions as part of a two-year restructuring plan, and record more than $1 billion in pretax charges on employee-related costs.</p><p class=\"\">Ferrari was up 6.6% after the Italian supercar maker reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and revenue.</p><p class=\"\">Clorox reported a 15% drop in fiscal second-quarter sales to $1.69 billion, and said it now expects fiscal-year sales to fall 1% to 2%, down from a prior outlook for sales to be flat to down 2%. Shares of the cleaning-products maker were down 7%.</p><p class=\"\">Earnings reports are expected after the closing bell Tuesday from Alphabet, Advanced Micro Devices, Chipotle Mexican Grill, and Amgen.</p><p class=\"\">Alphabet stock rose 2% ahead of fourth-quarter earnings from the parent company of Google. Wall Street expects Alphabet to report earnings of $2.13 a share on revenue of $96.7 billion, up from per-share profit of $1.64 on revenue of $86.3 billion a year earlier. Cloud growth at the company and updates on its AI investments will be closely watched by investors.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Joe Woelfel at  joseph.woelfel@barrons.com and Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

For the fourth quarter of 2024, revenue was $912.0 million, net income attributable to ChampionX was $82.8 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $212.3 million. Income before income taxes margin was 13.0%, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.3%. Cash provided by operating activities was $207.3 million, and free cash flow was $170.1 million.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">CEO Commentary</strong></p><p class=\"\">“2024 was a year in which we continued to demonstrate the unique nature of ChampionX’s cash flow resiliency, driven by the strength of our high-margin operating model and capital-light portfolio of businesses. We delivered robust adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and generated strong free cash flow. Our differentiated performance is the direct result of our employees around the world remaining committed to serving our customers well and living our continuous improvement culture daily. I am thankful and humbled to lead such a remarkably dedicated team,” ChampionX’s President and Chief Executive Officer Sivasankaran “Soma” Somasundaram said.</p><p class=\"\">“During the fourth quarter of 2024, we generated revenue of $912 million, which increased 1% sequentially, driven by seasonal strength in our Production Chemical Technologies business. Sequential growth in Production Chemical Technologies was offset by typical seasonal declines in our Production &amp; Automation Technologies business into the year-end holidays. For the full year 2024, we generated revenue of $3.6 billion, and we grew our North America revenue by 3% year-over-year, driven by particular strength in the Permian basin. We generated net income attributable to ChampionX of $83 million, income before income taxes margin of 13.0%, and delivered adjusted EBITDA of $212 million, representing a 23.3% adjusted EBITDA margin, our highest level as ChampionX, which speaks to the continued productivity and profitability focus of our team. For the full year 2024, we generated net income attributable to ChampionX of $320 million, income before income taxes margin of 12.2%, a 90 basis point increase over the prior year, and delivered adjusted EBITDA of $785 million, representing a 21.6% adjusted EBITDA margin, an increase of 107 basis points year-over-year.</p><p class=\"\">“We once again demonstrated our strong cash flow profile. Cash flow from operating activities was $207 million during the fourth quarter, which represented 250% of net income attributable to ChampionX, and includes a $48 million tax payment deferred from the fourth quarter of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025. We generated robust free cash flow of $170 million during the fourth quarter, converting 80% of our adjusted EBITDA for the period. Cash flow from operating activities was $590 million for the full year 2024, which represented 184% of net income attributable to ChampionX. For the full year 2024, we generated free cash flow of $460 million and achieved 59% adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow conversion. Our balance sheet and financial position remain strong, ending the year with approximately $1.2 billion of liquidity, including $508 million of cash and $675 million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility.</p><p class=\"\">“As we look ahead to 2025, we expect global oil production to grow, and given our differentiated and resilient production-oriented portfolio, we expect another year of positive performance relative to general oil and gas market activity.”</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Agreement to be Acquired by SLB</strong></p><p class=\"\">On April 2, 2024, SLB  and ChampionX jointly announced a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) for SLB to purchase ChampionX in an all-stock transaction.   The transaction was unanimously approved by the ChampionX board of directors and the transaction received the approval of the ChampionX stockholders at a special meeting held on June 18, 2024.   The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.</p><p class=\"\">ChampionX may continue to pay its regular quarterly cash dividends with customary record and payment dates, subject to certain limitations under the Merger Agreement.   Given the pending acquisition of ChampionX by SLB, ChampionX has discontinued providing quarterly guidance and will not host a conference call or webcast to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2024 results.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Production Chemical Technologies</strong></p><p class=\"\">Production Chemical Technologies revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024 was $569.7 million, an increase of $10.1 million, or 2%, sequentially, due to seasonally higher volumes in certain international markets and higher volumes in North America.</p><p class=\"\">Segment operating profit was $103.6 million and adjusted segment EBITDA was $133.5 million.

Management believes that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income attributable to ChampionX and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ChampionX, provide useful information to investors regarding the Company’s financial condition and results of operations because they reflect the core operating results of our businesses and help facilitate comparisons of operating performance across periods. In addition, free cash flow, free cash flow to adjusted EBITDA ratio, and free cash flow to revenue ratio are used by management to measure our ability to generate positive cash flow for debt reduction and to support our strategic objectives. Although management believes the aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures are good tools for internal use and the investment community in evaluating ChampionX’s overall financial performance, the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the accompanying financial tables.</p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">About ChampionX</strong></p><p class=\"\">ChampionX is a global leader in chemistry solutions, artificial lift systems, and highly engineered equipment and technologies that help companies drill for and produce oil and gas safely, efficiently, and sustainably around the world.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including projections of financial performance; statements of plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations; any statement concerning developments, performance or industry rankings relating to products or services; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing; and any other statements that address activities, events or developments that the Company intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future.</p><p class=\"\">Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such plans, estimates or expectations include, among others: changes in U.S. or global economic, financial, business and political conditions, including changes to governmental budgetary priorities; our ability to comply with the various procurement and other laws and regulations; risks associated with contracts with governmental entities; reviews and audits by the U.S. government and others; changes to our professional reputation and relationship with government agencies; the occurrence of an accident or safety incident; the ability of the Company to control costs, meet performance requirements or contractual schedules, compete effectively or implement its business strategy; the ability of the Company to retain and hire key personnel, and retain and engage key customers and suppliers; the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the 2024 transaction with Jacobs Solutions Inc.; potential liabilities associated with shareholder litigation or other settlements or investigations; evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes; and other factors set forth under Item 1A, Risk Factors in the annual report on Form 10-K (the \"Annual Report\"), and from time to time in documents that we file with the SEC. The above list of factors is not exhaustive or necessarily in order of importance. For additional information on identifying factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in forward-looking statements, see the discussions under the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in the Annual Report. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise such statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.</p><p class=\"\">Pro Forma and Non-GAAP Measures</p><p class=\"\">This release includes the presentation and discussion of pro forma financial information that incorporates the results of CMS prepared in accordance with the requirements of Article 11 of Regulation S-X. This release also includes the presentation and discussion of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, and Free Cash Flow, which are not measures of financial performance under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"), each of which are pro forma when reporting for the fiscal quarter ended December 29, 2023. These pro forma and non-GAAP measures should be considered only as supplements to, and should not be considered in isolation or used as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management of the Company believes these pro forma and non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with the Company's financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and, where applicable, the reconciliations herein to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, provide useful information to management, investors and other users of the Company's financial information in evaluating operating results and understanding operating trends by adjusting for the effects of items we do not consider to be indicative of the Company's ongoing performance, the inclusion of which can obscure underlying trends. Additionally, management of the Company uses such measures in its evaluation of business performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods, and believes these measures are useful for investors because they facilitate a comparison of financial results from period to period. The computation of pro forma and non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, thus limiting their use for comparability.</p><p class=\"\">Definitions of applicable non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided elsewhere in this release.</p><p class=\"\">In addition to the above non-GAAP financial measures, the Company has included backlog, net bookings, and book-to-bill in this release. Backlog is an operational measure representing the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts, and net bookings represent the change in backlog between reporting periods plus reported revenues for the period. Book-to-bill represents net bookings divided by reported revenues for the same period. We believe these metrics are useful for investors because they are an important measure of business development performance and are used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results.</p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"> <br/>                           AMENTUM HOLDINGS, INC. <br/>         UNAUDITED CONDENSED

Gladstone Land's farms are predominantly located in regions where its tenants are able to grow fresh produce annual row crops, such as berries and vegetables, which are generally planted and harvested annually. The Company also owns farms growing permanent crops, such as almonds, apples, cherries, figs, lemons, olives, pistachios, and other orchards, as well as blueberry groves and vineyards, which are generally planted every 20-plus years and harvested annually. Approximately 30% of the Company's fresh produce acreage is either organic or in transition to become organic, and over 20% of its permanent crop acreage falls into this category. The Company may also acquire property related to farming, such as cooling facilities, processing buildings, packaging facilities, and distribution centers. Gladstone Land pays monthly distributions to its stockholders and has paid 144 consecutive monthly cash distributions on its common stock since its initial public offering in January 2013.

Briquilimab is a targeted aglycosylated monoclonal antibody that blocks stem cell factor from binding to the cell-surface receptor c-Kit, also known as CD117, thereby inhibiting signaling through the receptor. This inhibition disrupts the critical survival signal, leading to the depletion of the mast cells via apoptosis which removes the underlying source of the inflammatory response in mast cell driven diseases such as chronic urticaria and asthma. Jasper is currently conducting clinical studies of briquilimab as a treatment in patients with CSU, CIndU or asthma. Briquilimab has a demonstrated efficacy and safety profile in patients and healthy volunteers, with positive clinical outcomes in CSU and CIndU.

Our priorities for the year were to grow profitability, expand gross margin, and generate strong free cash flow and we achieved all three objectives, well ahead of expectations. As we progress through 2025, our 80(th) anniversary year, we look forward to growing both top and bottom line and continuing to successfully execute our multi-year strategy.\"</p><p class=\"\">Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO of Mattel, added: \"We had a strong fourth quarter with both sales growth and margin expansion. We continued to strengthen our balance sheet, repurchased $400 million of shares in 2024, further improved our leverage ratio, and are tracking ahead of schedule to achieve our $200 million cost savings target by the end of 2026. Mattel's 2025 guidance includes our expectation to grow top and bottom line, increase investments in digital games, and repurchase $600 million of shares.

Mattel is unable to predict with sufficient certainty items that would be excluded from the corresponding GAAP measures, including the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, unusual gains and losses or charges, and severance and restructuring charges, due to the unpredictable nature of such items, which may have a significant impact on Mattel's GAAP measures.</p><p class=\"\">We are operating in a macro-economic environment that may impact consumer demand.

Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and include statements regarding Mattel's guidance and goals for future periods and other future events. The use of words such as \"anticipates,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"projects, \" \"looks forward,\" \"confident that,\" \"believes,\" and \"targeted,\" among others, generally identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available operating, financial, economic, and other information and assumptions, and are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties. A variety of factors or combination of factors, many of which are beyond Mattel's control, may cause actual future results or outcomes, or the timing of those results or outcomes, to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Specific factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (i) Mattel's ability to design, develop, produce, manufacture, source, ship, and distribute products in a timely and cost-effective manner; (ii) sufficient interest in and demand for the products and entertainment Mattel offers by retail customers and consumers to profitably recover Mattel's costs; (iii) downturns in economic conditions affecting Mattel's markets which can negatively impact retail customers and consumers, and which can result in lower employment levels and lower consumer disposable income and spending, including lower spending on purchases of Mattel's products; (iv) other factors which can lower discretionary consumer spending, such as higher costs for fuel and food, drops in the value of homes or other consumer assets, and high levels of consumer debt; (v) potential difficulties or delays Mattel may experience in implementing cost savings and efficiency enhancing initiatives; (vi) other economic and public health conditions or regulatory changes in the markets in which Mattel and its customers and suppliers operate, which could create delays or increase Mattel's costs, such as higher commodity prices, labor costs, transportation costs, trade restrictions, or outbreaks of disease; (vii) the effect of inflation on Mattel's business, including cost inflation in supply chain inputs and increased labor costs, as well as pricing actions taken in an effort to mitigate the effects of inflation; (viii) currency fluctuations, including movements in foreign exchange rates, which can lower Mattel's net revenues and earnings, and significantly impact Mattel's costs; (ix) the concentration of Mattel's customers, potentially increasing the negative impact to Mattel of difficulties experienced by any of Mattel's customers, such as bankruptcies or liquidations or a general lack of success, or changes in their purchasing or selling patterns; (x) the inventory policies of Mattel's retail customers, as well as the concentration of Mattel's revenues in the second half of the year, which coupled with reliance by retailers on quick response inventory management techniques, increases the risk of underproduction, overproduction, and shipping delays; (xi) legal, reputational, and financial risks related to security breaches or cyberattacks; (xii) work disruptions, including as a result of supply chain disruption such as plant or port closures, which may impact Mattel's ability to manufacture or deliver product in a timely and cost-effective manner; (xiii) the impact of competition on revenues, margins, and other aspects of Mattel's business, including the ability to offer products that consumers choose to buy instead of competitive products, the ability to secure, maintain, and renew popular licenses from licensors of entertainment properties, and the ability to attract and retain talented employees and adapt to evolving workplace models; (xiv) the risk of product recalls or product liability suits and costs associated with product safety regulations; (xv) tariffs, which depending on the effective date and duration of such tariffs, changes in the amount, scope, and nature of the tariffs in the future, any countermeasures that the target countries may take, and any mitigating actions that may become available, could increase Mattel's product costs and other costs of doing business, and other changes in laws or regulations in the United States and/or in other major markets, such as China, in which Mattel operates, including, without limitation, with respect to taxes, trade policies, product safety, or sustainability, which may also increase Mattel's product costs and other costs of doing business, and in each case reduce Mattel's earnings and liquidity; (xvi) business disruptions or other unforeseen impacts due to economic instability, political instability, civil unrest, armed hostilities (including the impact of the war in Ukraine and geopolitical developments in the Middle East) or terrorist activities, natural and man-made disasters, pandemics or other public health crises, or other catastrophic events; (xvii) failure to realize the planned benefits from any investments or acquisitions made by Mattel; (xviii) the impact of other market conditions or third-party actions or approvals, including those that result in any significant failure, inadequacy, or interruption from vendors or outsourcers, which could reduce demand for Mattel's products, delay or increase the cost of implementation of Mattel's programs, or alter Mattel's actions and reduce actual results; (xix) changes in financing markets or the inability of Mattel to obtain financing on attractive terms; (xx) the impact of litigation, arbitration, or regulatory decisions or settlement actions; (xxi) Mattel's ability to navigate regulatory frameworks in connection with new areas of investment, product development, or other business activities, such as artificial intelligence, non-fungible tokens, and cryptocurrency; (xxii) an inability to remediate the material weakness in Mattel's internal control over financial reporting, or additional material weaknesses or other deficiencies in the future or the failure to maintain an effective system of internal control; and (xxiii) other risks and uncertainties as may be described in Mattel's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the \"Risk Factors\" section of Mattel's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent periodic filings, as well as in Mattel's other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so, except as required by law.</p><p class=\"\">Presentation Information / Non-GAAP Financial Measures</p><p class=\"\">The financial results included herein represent the most current information available to management and are preliminary until Mattel's Form 10-Q is filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ from these preliminary results.</p><p class=\"\">To supplement our financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"), Mattel presents certain non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP financial measures that Mattel uses in this earnings release include Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Other Selling and Administrative Expenses, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, Adjusted Earnings Per Share, earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow Conversion (Free Cash Flow / Adjusted EBITDA), Leverage Ratio (Total Debt / Adjusted EBITDA), Net Debt, Adjusted Tax Rate, and constant currency. Mattel uses these measures to analyze its continuing operations and to monitor, assess, and identify meaningful trends in its operating and financial performance, and each is discussed below. Mattel believes that the disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to investors to be able to better evaluate ongoing business performance and certain components of Mattel's results. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for GAAP financial measures and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are attached to this earnings release as exhibits and to our earnings slide presentation as an appendix.</p><p class=\"\">This earnings release and our earnings slide presentation are available on Mattel's Investor Relations website, https://investors.mattel.com/, under the subheading \"Financial Information — Quarterly Earnings.\"</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin represent reported Gross Profit and reported Gross Margin, respectively, adjusted to exclude severance and restructuring expenses. Adjusted Gross Margin represents Mattel's Adjusted Gross Profit, as a percentage of Net Sales. Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin are presented to provide additional perspective on underlying trends in Mattel's core Gross Profit and Gross Margin, which Mattel believes is useful supplemental information for investors to be able to gauge and compare Mattel's current business performance from one period to another.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted Other Selling and Administrative Expenses</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted Other Selling and Administrative Expenses represents Mattel's reported Other Selling and Administrative Expenses, adjusted to exclude severance and restructuring expenses, the impact of the inclined sleeper product recalls, and the impact of sale of assets, which are not part of Mattel's core business. Adjusted Other Selling and Administrative Expenses is presented to provide additional perspective on underlying trends in Mattel's core other selling and administrative expenses, which Mattel believes is useful supplemental information for investors to be able to gauge and compare Mattel's current business performance from one period to another.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Income Margin</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Income Margin represent reported Operating Income and reported Operating Income Margin, respectively, adjusted to exclude severance and restructuring expenses, the impact of the inclined sleeper product recalls, and the impact of sale of assets, which are not part of Mattel's core business. Adjusted Operating Income Margin represents Mattel's Adjusted Operating Income, as a percentage of Net Sales. Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Income Margin are presented to provide additional perspective on underlying trends in Mattel's core operating results, which Mattel believes is useful supplemental information for investors to be able to gauge and compare Mattel's current business performance from one period to another.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted Earnings Per Share</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted Earnings Per Share represents Mattel's reported Diluted Earnings Per Common Share, adjusted to exclude severance and restructuring expenses, the impact of the inclined sleeper product recalls, the impact of sale of assets, the impact of changes to certain deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances, which are not part of Mattel's core business. The aggregate tax effect of the adjustments was determined using the effective tax rates on a jurisdictional basis of the respective adjustments and dividing by the reported weighted-average number of common shares. Adjusted Earnings Per Share is presented to provide additional perspective on underlying trends in Mattel's core business. Mattel believes it is useful supplemental information for investors to gauge and compare Mattel's current earnings results from one period to another. Adjusted Earnings Per Share is a performance measure and should not be used as a measure of liquidity.</p><p class=\"\">EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA</p><p class=\"\">EBITDA represents Mattel's Net Income, adjusted to exclude the impact of interest expense, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted to exclude share-based compensation, severance and restructuring expenses, the impact of the inclined sleeper product recalls, and the impact of sale of assets, which are not part of Mattel's core business. Mattel believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental information for investors to gauge and compare Mattel's business performance to other companies in its industry with similar capital structures. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA differs from how Mattel calculates EBITDA for purposes of covenant compliance under the indentures governing its high yield senior notes and the revolving credit agreement governing its revolving credit facility. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to invest in the growth of Mattel's business. As a result, Mattel relies primarily on its GAAP results and uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally.</p><p class=\"\">Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Conversion</p><p class=\"\">Free Cash Flow represents Mattel's net cash flows from for operating activities less capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow Conversion represents Mattel's free cash flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA. Mattel believes Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Conversion are useful supplemental information for investors to gauge Mattel's liquidity and performance and to compare Mattel's business performance to other companies in our industry. Free Cash Flow does not represent cash available to Mattel for discretionary expenditures.</p><p class=\"\">Leverage Ratio (Total Debt / Adjusted EBITDA)</p><p class=\"\">The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Total Debt by Adjusted EBITDA. Total Debt represents the aggregate of Mattel's current portion of long-term debt, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt, excluding the impact of debt issuance costs and debt discount. Mattel believes the leverage ratio is useful supplemental information for investors to gauge trends in Mattel's business and to compare Mattel's business performance to other companies in its industry.</p><p class=\"\">Net Debt</p><p class=\"\">Net Debt represents the aggregate of Mattel's current portion of long-term debt, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt, less cash and equivalents. Mattel believes Net Debt is useful supplemental information for investors to monitor Mattel's liquidity and evaluate its balance sheet.</p><p class=\"\">Adjusted Tax Rate</p><p class=\"\">The Adjusted Tax Rate is calculated by dividing Adjusted Provision for Income Taxes by Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes. Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes represents reported Income Before Income Taxes, adjusted to exclude severance and restructuring expenses, the impact of inclined sleeper product recalls, and the impact of sale of assets. The Adjusted Provision for Income Taxes represents reported Provision for Income Taxes, adjusted to exclude the impact of changes to certain deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances and the aggregate tax effect of adjustments. Mattel believes the adjusted tax rate provides useful supplemental information for investors to gauge and compare the impact of tax expense on Mattel's earnings results from one period to another.</p><p class=\"\">Constant Currency</p><p class=\"\">Percentage changes in results expressed in constant currency are presented excluding the impact from changes in currency exchange rates. To present this information, Mattel calculates constant currency information by translating current period and prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than the US dollar using consistent exchange rates. The constant currency exchange rates are determined by Mattel at the beginning of each year and are applied consistently during the year. They are generally different from the actual exchange rates in effect during the current or prior period due to volatility in actual foreign exchange rates. Mattel considers whether any changes to the constant currency rates are appropriate at the beginning of each year. The exchange rates used for these constant currency calculations are generally based on prior year actual exchange rates. The difference between the current period and prior period results using the consistent exchange rates reflects the changes in the underlying performance results, excluding the impact from changes in currency exchange rates. Mattel analyzes constant currency results to provide additional perspective on changes in underlying trends in Mattel's operating performance. Mattel believes that the disclosure of the percentage change in constant currency is useful supplemental information for investors to be able to gauge Mattel's current business performance and the longer-term strength of its overall business since foreign currency changes could potentially mask underlying sales trends. The disclosure of the percentage change in constant currency enhances investor's ability to compare financial results from one period to another.</p><p class=\"\">Key Performance Indicator</p><p class=\"\">Gross Billings</p><p class=\"\">Gross Billings represent amounts invoiced to customers. It does not include the impact of sales adjustments, such as trade discounts and other allowances. Mattel presents changes in gross billings as a metric for comparing its aggregate, categorical, brand, and geographic results to highlight significant trends in Mattel's business. Changes in Gross Billings are discussed because, while Mattel records the details of sales adjustments in its financial accounting systems at the time of sale, such sales adjustments are generally not associated with categories, brands, and individual products.</p><p class=\"\">About Mattel Mattel is a leading global toy and family entertainment company and owner of one of the most iconic brand portfolios in the world.
