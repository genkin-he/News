Nissan would face pressure surviving amid stiff competition in the U.S. and China, especially as it has a larger risk exposure to U.S. tariffs on Mexico than Honda and Toyota, the analyst says. However, even if the merger goes through, that wouldn't solve the challenges the two companies face. Both carmakers lack compelling EV offerings, and the combined entity would need to build a new EV model pipeline, he says. The two could benefit from larger scale and cost synergy, but that would take time to realize, Sun says. In any case, Nissan would find it difficult to \"play a smaller role in the new entity rather than standing on an equal footing with Honda,\" he adds.

Financial markets on Tuesday had a muted reaction to China's retaliatory tariffs of 10%-15% on select U.S. goods, but there's a chance of a stronger reaction down the line if negotiations don't see results, Mohi-uddin says. Should U.S. tariffs on China remain at 10% this year, the impact should be manageable, he notes, adding that the measures will trim about 0.5% from China's GDP growth this year from its 5.0% rate in 2024. However, should the tariffs be raised to 20%-30%, growth may fall closer to 4.0%, Mohi-uddin estimates.

Grab is likely to strengthen its leadership position in ride-hailing and deliveries, as it invests into products to help expand its total addressable market with affordable products, they say. However, as the priority will be on new product initiatives, cross-selling and lending products, HSBC trims earlier margin estimates and reduces its adjusted Ebitda projection by 2%-5% for 2025-2026. HSBC lowers its target price to $5.45 from $5.50 but upgrades its stock rating to buy from hold as the stock offers 20% upside, and valuations have become attractive after the recent price correction.

The market is debating on the long-term impact, as optimists argue that a lower entry barrier would attract new players, which should boost semiconductor demand, they write. \"We do not expect much weakness in the near-term demand,\" the analysts note. They add that long-term demand will be determined by changes in AI-driven computing needs, such as inference, noting that such demand could offset the possibly lower computing demand in training. DeepSeek's development marks a major evolution, though not entirely a revolution, in artificial intelligence, they say.

Management highlighted the bank's improving debt collection capabilities, supported by its front office staff helping with loan collections as soon as the loans become overdue, the analyst says in a research report. Also, the bank sold non-performing loans worth THB1.9 billion last year and plans to sell THB1.4 billion worth of NPLs this year, the analyst adds. The brokerage raises the stock's target price to THB26.12 from THB26.00 with an unchanged add rating. Shares are 1.0% lower at THB19.00. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0511 GMT - The U.S. Postal Services will likely need time to sort out how to implement new the tariff policy before resuming acceptance of Chinese packages, according to Chelsey Tam, senior equity analyst at Morningstar in an email. The process poses a significant challenge, given that in 2024, an estimated 4 million daily packages arrived in the U.S. under the de minimis rule, which allows low-value shipments to bypass duties and custom scrutiny, Tam says. The Trump administration revoked this exemption for China as part of broader tariff measures. Among Chinese e-commerce players, PDD Holdings will be hurt as its overseas e-commerce platform Temu has a significant exposure in the U.S., the analyst notes. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)</p></span></div>",

For the full year, sales grew by 7%, reflecting strong contribution from acquisitions of 8%, and a small organic sales decline of 1%. Our operating margin expanded to 16.2%, within the target range of 16-17%.</p><p class=\"\">In the fourth quarter of 2024, organic sales were stable, with net positive contribution from acquisitions of 6% and currency effects of 1%. Global Technologies delivered strong organic growth of 5% with strong performance in most business areas and with Physical Access Control having comparable figures at normalized levels for the full quarter. Americas delivered good organic growth of 2%, with strong growth in the North America Non-Residential segment and in Latin America. Organic sales were stable in EMEIA with commercial segments compensating for continued weak residential demand. Similarly, weak residential markets and weak demand for loading docks resulted in an organic sales decline of 2% in Entrance Systems. Asia Pacific's organic sales declined significantly by 11%, mainly due to very weak demand in China.</p><p class=\"\">The operating profit for the quarter increased by 14% to a record SEK 6,529 M with a corresponding margin of 16.5% (15.5). The operating leverage was very strong at 120 bps, driven by continued price/cost tailwind and strong operational execution, overcompensating for dilution from acquisitions. The operating cash flow increased by 10% in the quarter to a record SEK 8,010 M with a cash conversion of 141% (150).</p><p class=\"\">Focus on accelerating our sales growth</p><p class=\"\">Accelerating organic growth remains a key priority going forward. An important part of our strategy is upgrading the installed base with innovative digital and electromechanical products and solutions. We invest 4% of annual sales in R&amp;D which allows us to strengthen our offering and drive the transition forward. Electromechanical products and solutions are the most important growth driver in our portfolio, with currency adjusted growth of 8% in 2024 and an annual growth rate of 9% in the last ten years in our regional divisions. Through upgrades we can support customers with enhanced security and convenience, but also grow recurring revenue streams. Recurring revenue continues to be a key driver for growth with subscription-based models, service agreements, and digital solutions like remote monitoring and mobile access. In 2024, sales of our subscription-based solutions grew by 18%. Our decentralized organization and region-specific product development provide further opportunities in the emerging markets, that only represent 13% of our sales. In 2024, our currency adjusted sales in emerging markets excluding China grew by 10%.</p><p class=\"\">A record 26 acquisitions were completed in 2024, adding annualized sales close to SEK 8 bn. In the fourth quarter, we completed eight acquisitions. Acquisitions remain a key driver for growth and the pipeline remains strong.</p><p class=\"\">By leveraging our market-leading products and solutions with our local knowledge and global presence, we are confident in our ability to drive continued value for our customers, employees and shareholders.
