The altcoin disrupted multi-year resistance levels, and in January, XRP recorded its highest monthly close at $3.03. </p><p class=\"\">The recent flash crash due to a non-crypto political event implied that buyers’ liquidity is slowly evaporating on the upside. With the markets riddled with volatility, XRP’s long-term chart painted the formation of a bearish divergence on both the daily and weekly charts. <span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:591.1634756995581px;max-width:1200px;aspect-ratio:2.029895366218236\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/cointelegraph:5c8f59aaf094b-aa5bd6f757d5eed6ebe10a08433ef0a1-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"Ripple, XRP, Markets, Price Analysis, Market Analysis, Altcoin Watch\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/cointelegraph:5c8f59aaf094b-aa5bd6f757d5eed6ebe10a08433ef0a1-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f6f6f7\"/></picture></div></figure></span></p><p class=\"\">As illustrated in the chart, XRP’s price has formed a higher high over the recent weeks, whereas its relative strength index (RSI) has formed a lower high. The RSI indicator on both charts also trended down from an overbought region, which means buyers are slowing down and losing momentum. </p><p class=\"\">While XRP has managed to invalidate previous divergences formed on the lower time frames (LTF), a bearish divergence on the 1-day and weekly chart raises concerns since high-time frame (HTF) charts determine a more dominant trend. </p><p class=\"\">The potential consequence of these bearish divergences is another move below $2, which is a 23% drop from its current value. The probability has also increased since the altcoin formed a new low at $1.78, where new liquidity pockets will be formed. </p><p class=\"\"><em><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Related: Why is XRP price up today?</strong></em></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Will XRP invalidate its bearish thesis?</strong></p><p class=\"\">A fundamental part of technical analysis is that each signal or pattern has an invalidation. Likewise, XRP’s bearish divergence on the daily and weekly chart could also be dismissed if the altcoin can retain a position above $2.90 on the daily chart. <span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:592.4723247232472px;max-width:1200px;aspect-ratio:2.0254110612855007\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/cointelegraph:5c8f59aaf094b-2e23430ede5944f59ddf284a8766df1d-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"Ripple, XRP, Markets, Price Analysis, Market Analysis, Altcoin Watch\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/cointelegraph:5c8f59aaf094b-2e23430ede5944f59ddf284a8766df1d-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f9f8f9\"/></picture></div></figure></span></p><p class=\"\">The $2.90 level was XRP’s previous higher high formed in December, which also acted as a support level after XRP re-tested its previous all-time high at $3.40. Binance and Coinbase spot activity was also largely concentrated around $2.90, which sent the altcoin above $3 in mid-January. </p><p class=\"\">A recovery above $2.90 would re-establish a bullish market structure, diminishing the effects of XRP’s recent bearish lows. However, time is of the essence in these conditions, as a continued lack of clear directional bias favors the bears since sellers were the market movers for the last major price move. </p><p class=\"\"><em><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\">Related: Bitcoin bull trap?

Kennedy Jr.'s health secretary nomination to head to a full Senate vote, pushing him a major step closer to confirmation.</p><p class=\"\">The committee voted Tuesday to favorably refer Trump's Health and Human Services secretary nominee — a strident critic of vaccines and a skeptic of their vaccine — to the Senate. Drug and food stocks stumbled after the panel's vote, as the once unthinkable notion of Kennedy leading the federal government's public health bureaucracy moved closer to reality.</p><p class=\"\">Shares of Pfizer, a major vaccine maker, fell from $26.25 ahead of the vote to $25.66 immediately after, a 2.2% drop. The stock is now down on the day, though releasing earnings results Tuesday morning that beat expectations.</p><p class=\"\">Shares of the vaccine maker Moderna tumbled 9% following the vote before recovering, and are are now down 3.9% on the day.</p><p class=\"\">The S&amp;P 500 Pharmaceuticals Industry index, which tracks drug stocks in the S&amp;P 500, fell roughly 1% following the vote, and the SPDR S&amp;P Biotech ETF, which tracks biotech stocks, fell 1.5%.</p><p class=\"\">Food stocks also dropped, and the S&amp;P Food and Beverage Select Industry index was down roughly 0.6% following the vote.</p><p class=\"\">A powerful Republican, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R., La.), had directed challenging lines of questioning at Kennedy in hearings last week, leading to widespread speculation that he might eventually oppose the nominee's approval.</p><p class=\"\">On Tuesday, however, Cassidy voted to favorably approve Kennedy's nomination out of committee. The vote was split along party lines, with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent, voting with the Democrats.</p><p class=\"\">Cassidy could still vote against Kennedy when the full Senate votes. He arrived late to Tuesday's committee meeting, and left without making any comments on his vote. If four Republicans vote against Kennedy on the Senate floor, his nomination would fail.</p><p class=\"\">The vote of the full Senate on the nomination has not yet been scheduled.</p><p class=\"\">Kennedy's bid to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services — which has the largest budget of any federal agency — has roiled Washington more than virtually any of President Donald Trump's top nominees thus far.</p><p class=\"\">Kennedy's stance toward vaccines has been a key focus for lawmakers.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><span><p class=\"\">By Jinjoo Lee</p><p class=\"\">After days of trying to process what tariffs on Canadian and Mexican oil might mean for their business, U.S. refiners saw their shares bouncing on news that the tariffs would be delayed.</p><p class=\"\">Refining giants Marathon Petroleum and Valero Energy were up 6.6% and 4.2%, respectively, and were both among the top-10 gainers on the S&amp;P 500 as of early afternoon Tuesday. It also helped that Marathon on Tuesday reported better-than-expected earnings.</p><p class=\"\">The proposed 10% tariffs on Canadian energy and 25% on imports from Mexico would have caused headaches and added costs for U.S. refiners. Canada and Mexico are the two largest sources of crude oil imports for the U.S., supplying about 60% and 7% of crude oil imports, respectively. While the U.S. is a net exporter of crude oil, most of its refineries need heavy crudes-the types supplied by Canada and Mexico-to run efficiently. Most of the crude oil produced domestically is the lighter variety.</p><p class=\"\">Refiners with a heavy footprint in landlocked areas-such as the Midwest and the Rocky Mountain regions-might have borne heavier costs than others. Most Canadian crude ends up in those places where there aren't many alternative heavy crude options. Refiners with the highest exposure to Canadian crude rallied the most Tuesday. HF Sinclair and Par Pacific, for instance, rely on the Northern neighbor for more than a quarter of their crude input, per estimates from energy-focused investment bank Tudor, Pickering Holt (TPH). HF Sinclair shares rose 6.5%, while Par Pacific added 6.1%.</p><p class=\"\">Marathon Petroleum relies on Canada for 17% of its crude diet, according to TPH. But Rick Hessling, Marathon's chief commercial officer, said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that it has worked \"tirelessly for a long time\" on its logistics capability. He noted that many of its refineries in the mid-continent region can pivot to local crudes such as those from the Bakken and the Rockies.</p><p class=\"\">Even so, switching to lighter crude would come with costs of its own: Doug Leggate, equity analyst at Wolfe Research, noted in a report that refiners choosing to shift to lighter crude may have to lower their refinery runs \"given the higher light product yield that its system may not be able to process.\" TPH estimates that a 10% tariff on Canadian oil could cause a $2 to $4 per barrel cost for Canadian producers, $1 to $2 a barrel for U.S. refineries and $1 to $3 a barrel for U.S. consumers.</p><p class=\"\">The ultimate split of those costs won't be known unless the proposed tariffs are actually put in place. What is clear is that there aren't many clear winners in the oil industry from a tariff scenario.</p><p class=\"\">This item is part of a Wall Street Journal live coverage event.
