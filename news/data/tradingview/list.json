Read a preview of Novo Nordisk below and check back for more analysis soon.</p><p class=\"\">When Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk reports its quarterly financial results on Wednesday, investors will be looking for reassurance the GLP-1 market is still on track for the enormous growth Wall Street expects.</p><p class=\"\">Novo shares have taken a beating in recent months, with the stock's American depositary receipts falling nearly 40% in the last six months of 2024. Shares first slid on growing worries that sales of its weight-loss drug Wegovy and its Type 2 diabetes drug Ozempic wouldn't live up to the hype, and then on very disappointing trial data.</p><p class=\"\">A positive pipeline update in January wasn't enough to reverse the momentum, and the ADRs were down roughly 30% over the past 12 months as of Tuesday.</p><p class=\"\">Novo's Wegovy and Ozempic are among the most consequential, closely watched new medications in recent history, but they face serious competition from Eli Lilly's Zepbound and Mounjaro, and from legal copycats manufactured by compounding pharmacies and sold by telehealth firms.</p><p class=\"\">While the compounders will soon be barred from selling knockoffs of the Lilly drugs, Novo's drugs remain in shortage, and can legally be copied.</p><p class=\"\">Analysts expect Novo to report fourth-quarter sales of 80.1 billion Danish Krone, or $11.1 billion, on Wednesday, and earnings of 5.98 DKK per share, or $0.83, according to FactSet.</p><p class=\"\">Investors will be paying particularly close attention to Wegovy and Ozempic sales for the quarter. Current FactSet consensus estimates put Wegovy sales at 20 billion DKK, or $2.8 billion, for the quarter, and Ozempic sales at 33 billion DKK, or $4.6 billion.</p><p class=\"\">Investors will also be looking for updates on supply of the two medicines. Novo in December closed an $11 billion deal to ramp up its supply of GLP-1 medicines, though it could take time for the results of that deal to be felt in the market.</p><p class=\"\">\"If we redirect everything that we have of GLP-1 to the U.S. we will be immediately out of the drug shortage situation,\" Henrik Wulff, executive vice president for product supply, quality, and information technology at Novo, told Barron's in December. But Novo serves markets worldwide.</p><p class=\"\">\"We try to balance these launches up against the in-market demands, and try to guesstimate how we can get out of the drug shortages,\" he said.</p><p class=\"\">Shares of Novo have yet to recover from a startling update in late December on CagriSema, a next-generation weight-loss drug. Novo had said it expected patients to lose at least 25% of their body weight on CagriSema, but in a Phase 3 trial patients only lost 22.7%.</p><p class=\"\">In January, Novo unveiled early results on another weight loss drug, amycretin, which appeared very promising, though the drug has years of studies ahead of it before it can make it to market.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Josh Nathan-Kazis at josh.nathan-kazis@barrons.com</p><p class=\"\">This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Of that total, foreign nationals accounted for 958,000 trips, up 22.9% in year-over-year terms after Beijing eased restrictions on foreign travel.</p><p class=\"\">During the Lunar New Year, China's goods consumption grew 9.9%, while services consumption rose 12.3% from the same period a year ago, according to the State Taxation Administration, based on value-added tax data. Sales of home appliances and furniture saw strong growth, driven by trade-in policies, alongside robust demand for tourism, cultural, and sports services, it said.</p><p class=\"\">The relatively positive data comes after a private gauge of services sector activity pointed to softer growth, and as markets continue to digest the opening salvos in the U.S.-China trade spat.</p><p class=\"\">On Tuesday, Beijing announced a series of retaliatory measures in response to President Trump's tariff hike on Chinese goods. China's measures targeted both U.S. goods and companies, including an additional 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas imports and a 10% levy on crude oil, agricultural machinery, and certain vehicles.</p><p class=\"\">Domestic policy is now the main thing to watch as the tariff action between the U.S. and China continues to unfold, the Citi analysts said.</p><p class=\"\">At the next big policy event in March, the National People's Congress, they expect Beijing to stick to a framework targeting economic growth of \"around 5.0%\" this year. Government financing could be expanded, and monetary policy might require some tweaking given the central bank's determination to keep the yuan stable, they said. More rate cuts and lower reserve requirements for lenders are likely on the cards.</p><p class=\"\">Write to Singapore editors at singaporeeditors@dowjones.com</p></span></div>",

China has, so far, made a relatively restrained response to Trump's additional 10% in tariffs, announcing levies that cover just $14 billion of U.S. exports.</p><p class=\"\">Beijing set a firm fix for its yuan, countering concerns it might allow the currency to slide to offset the impact of tariffs on its exports.</p><p class=\"\">Elsewhere in Asia, the Japanese yen  strengthened sharply against a range of currencies, after upbeat data on wages supported expectations of further tightening by the Bank of Japan this year.</p><p class=\"\">The dollar fell almost 1% against the yen to 152.875, while the euro  was down 0.6% at 159.18.</p><p class=\"\">Against the dollar, the euro rose 0.3% to $1.041 , having pulled off a two-year trough of $1.0125 at the start of the week.

The study is expected to include 140 participants and is being conducted at six clinics in Sweden (Uppsala, Stockholm, Gothenburg and LinkÃ¶ping), Denmark (Herlev) and the Netherlands (Groningen). Each person will participate in the study for eight weeks after dosing. The trial is double blind and placebo controlled. This means that neither the clinical staff administering the study drug, nor the participants, know which research subjects are receiving LIB-01 and which are receiving placebo. The clinical part of the study is expected to last until mid-2025.

The ambition is to create a drug with significantly longer effect and far fewer side effects, compared to current available drugs. Today, over 500 million men suffer from these sexual dysfunctions and the market is valued at USD 8 billion. Dicot Pharma's strategy is to develop LIB-01 under own auspices until phase 2a study and thereafter in partnership with larger, established pharmaceutical companies, finance and develop LIB-01 further to a registered pharmaceutical on the world market.</p><p class=\"\">Dicot Pharma is listed on Nasdaq First North and has approximately 8,100 shareholders.

This press <br/>release contains \"forward-looking statements\" as defined in Section 27A of the <br/>U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (as amended) and Section 21E of the Securities <br/>Exchange Act. The actual results may be grossly different from the projections <br/>implied or expressly stated as \"forward-looking statements\" due to known or <br/>unknown risks, uncertainties or other factors.

It <br/>is not necessarily the case that all financial information in this press <br/>release is equivalent to financial statements of companies in the United <br/>States. It may be difficult to enforce any right or claim arising under U.S. <br/>federal securities laws because the Offeror and Makino Milling Machine Co., <br/>Ltd. (\"the Target\") are incorporated outside the United States and their <br/>directors are non-U.S. residents. Shareholders may not be able to sue a <br/>company outside the United States and its directors in a non-U.S. court for <br/>violations of the U.S. securities laws. Furthermore, there is no guarantee <br/>that shareholders will be able to compel a company outside the United States <br/>or its subsidiaries and affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction <br/>of a U.S. court. The financial advisors of the Offeror or Target and their <br/>respective affiliates may, within their ordinary course of business, purchase, <br/>or conduct any act toward the purchase of, the shares of the common stock of <br/>the Target for their own account or for their customers' accounts outside the <br/>Tender Offer prior to the commencement of, or during, the period of the Tender <br/>Offer, etc. in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14e-5(b) under the <br/>Securities Exchange Act to the extent permissible under the financial <br/>instruments and exchange laws and other applicable laws and regulations in <br/>Japan. If any information concerning such purchase is disclosed in Japan, the <br/>disclosure of such information will be made in the United States in a similar <br/>manner. All the procedures in connection with the Tender Offer shall be taken <br/>in the Japanese language. While a part or all of the documents in connection <br/>with the Tender Offer may be prepared in English, the Japanese documents shall <br/>prevail in case of any discrepancies between Japanese documents and <br/>corresponding English documents.

In such cases, please take note of such restrictions and comply <br/>with them. In countries or regions where the implementation of the Tender <br/>Offer is illegal, even upon receiving this press release, such receipt shall <br/>not constitute a solicitation of an offer to sell or an offer to buy shares <br/>relating to the Tender Offer and shall be deemed a distribution of materials <br/>for informative purposes only. <br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class=\"\">View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250205311157/en/</p><p class=\"\">CONTACT:    Teruaki Urago</p><p class=\"\">General Manager</p><p class=\"\">Investor Relations</p><p class=\"\">+81-75-935-6140</p><p class=\"\">ir@nidec.com</p></span></div>",

(miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0910 GMT - Malaysia's benchmark Kuala Lumpur Composite Index ended 0.6% higher at 1574.51 amid bargain hunting. However, continuing concerns about rising U.S.-China trade tensions, fueled by the latest round of tit-for-tat tariffs, could limit further upside in the local benchmark's rebound, TA Securities analyst Stephen Soo says in a note. The KLCI could find support at 1550 and face resistance at 1605, he adds. Among gainers, Gamuda added 4.8% and YTL Power International rose 4.3%. Meanwhile, QL Resources lost 1.1% and SD Guthrie was 0.6% lower. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0859 GMT - The Polish zloty trades steady ahead of the National Bank of Poland's policy decision later. The central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged. This means the decision will be a \"non-event\" with the focus on any signals about future policy, ING analyst Frantisek Taborsky says in a note. The policy statement Wednesday and NBP Governor Adam Glapinski's press conference Thursday could both sound hawkish again by indicating rates will remain restrictive, Taborsky says. \"However, it's hard to imagine at this point what more the governor might add to the hawkish message from January.\" The NBP's decision is expected at 1400 GMT. EUR/PLN trades at 4.2112. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0851 GMT - Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.9% to close at 20597.09, weighed by consumer stocks. U.S.-China tariff developments remained in focus as the U.S. Postal Service said it will pause parcels from China and Hong Kong. Analysts say markets are waiting for the U.S. and China to hold talks on a deal to prevent the trade fight from escalating. Nongfu Spring dropped 6.9%, Trip.com Group lost 6.4% and China Mengniu Diary fell 4.6%. Among advancers, Lenovo Group rose 4.0%, while Orient Overseas (International) and Zhongsheng Group gained 3.1% each. (kimberley.kao@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0850 GMT - Pandora's results are broadly mixed, with 4Q performance in line with expectations but guidance softer than anticipated, RBC Capital Markets analyst Piral Dadhania says in a note. The Danish jeweler reported revenue of 11.97 billion Danish kroner ($1.67 billion) for the final quarter of 2024, up 11% organically on year. Analysts had forecast revenue of 11.85 billion kroner, according to company-compiled consensus. However, the group's guidance of organic revenue growth between 7% and 8% in 2025 is slightly softer than expected, which could prompt low-single-digit earnings revisions, the analyst says. The company expects the EBIT margin target by 2026 at the lower end of the 26% to 27% range, which will likely be received with some caution, Dadhania says. Shares are down 1.3% at 1,356.50 kroner. (andrea.figueras@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0847 GMT - Novo Nordisk's 2025 outlook is reassuring, says Sheena Berry at Quilter Cheviot. The Danish pharmaceutical company expects a robust 16%-24% sales growth for the year, Berry says. Fourth-quarter sales rose 30%, outpacing expectations, although this was partly driven by insulin rebate adjustments, she notes. The performance of key growth drivers, Ozempic and Wegovy, remains strong, with Ozempic meeting expectations and Wegovy slightly underperforming. Novo Nordisk is set to initiate a new CagriSema Phase 3 trial in 2025 and plans to file with regulators in the first quarter of 2026, a slight delay to ensure a secure supply chain. Shares trade 4.5% higher at 619 Danish kroner. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0845 GMT - DCC's process to sell its healthcare segment, in order to focus on the energy sector, could significantly boost returns to shareholders, Davy Research analyst Colin Grant says. The Irish research firm forecasts that DCC could receive 1.365 billion pounds for the division. This is more than 15 times the FY 2025 Ebitda expectations of 88 million pounds, the analyst adds in a note. Assuming that most of the cash will be returned to shareholders, this means that the disposal will unlock significant value as the deal could be far ahead of DCC's current valuation, Grant adds. DCC said in its third-quarter update that the disposal is progressing in line with expectations, the analyst says. Shares are down 2.4% at 53.65 pounds. (michael.susin@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0838 GMT - Novo Nordisk's initial 2025 outlook is just ahead of Jefferies's expectations. But given a higher starting point and stronger currency effects it suggests up to 6% sales and 10% EBIT consensus upgrades, analysts at the bank write. Novo Nordisk's fourth-quarter sales beat expectations by 5%, mostly on positive U.S. gross-to-net adjustments--the discount offered between the list price and the actual net sales price--for its insulins. Sales of Wegovy were shy of expectations while Ozempic and Rybelsus were in line. A better gross margin, higher research and development costs but less selling and distribution spend helped EBIT beat by 9% and EPS by 6%. The stock will likely tick higher initially but could then fade, Jefferies says. Shares trade 4.2% higher at 617.20 Danish kroner. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0837 GMT - GSK needs to convince investors of a sustainable vaccine outlook after it cut the 2025 sales target of its jabs, Shore Capital analyst Sean Conroy says. The British pharma company now guides for a low single-digit decrease in vaccine sales for this year after a slowdown in the U.S., notably for its RSV shot Arexvy that missed consensus estimates by 18%, the analyst says. \"Some tangible evidence the transient challenges facing Shingrix [shingles vaccine] and Arexvy can be navigated will likely be needed to reinstill the conviction in management's longer-term expectations for these,\" he says in a note. Shares are up 5.7% at 1,458.50 pence. (helena.smolak@wsj.com)</p><p class=\"\">0834 GMT - The cancellation of the \"de minimis\" rule, which allowed low-value shipments to bypass duties and custom scrutiny, as well as the subsequent suspension of Chinese goods shipments by the U.S. Postal Services, should be manageable for PDD Holdings' Temu, says Nomura analyst Jialong Shi tells Dow Jones Newswires. Temu has been preparing for this change in the past year, Shi notes, pointing to the company introducing a half consignment model in early 2024. Under this model, merchants typically ship products to the U.S. in bulk rather than relying on the so-called \"de minimis\" exemption, which was recently revoked by President Trump, Shi notes. While Temu still has significant growth potential in the U.S. market at this stage, uncertainties remain over whether the U.S. government will introduce new regulations to these Chinese companies, he says.
