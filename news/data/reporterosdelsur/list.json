This financial quake was triggered by rising tensions between the U.S. and China, with China reopening antitrust investigations into American tech titans like Google and NVIDIA, following new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.</p><p>As prices tumbled, <b>NEAR</b>, <b>Ai16z</b>, and <b>Bittensor</b> suffered significant losses. NEAR, the largest AI blockchain project, dropped by <b>7.9%</b>, while Bittensor’s token fell <b>5.9%</b> after a surge in its popularity just the week before. Meanwhile, Ai16z faced the largest impact, plummeting <b>13%</b> in a wave of investor panic surrounding the ongoing U.S.-China trade war.</p><p>The latest round of U.S. tariffs, which hit Chinese semiconductors, disrupted key supply chains vital for AI technologies, leaving investors anxious about the future. China’s renewed scrutiny over NVIDIA and other firms is seen as a potential retaliatory move, fuelling fears of an escalating trade war that could stall innovation and investment in AI-driven projects.</p><p>As these geopolitical tensions simmer, the outlook for the AI crypto sector remains precarious. Investors are watching the news closely—any major policy shifts from Washington or Beijing could tip the scales dramatically. While this sector is one of the most promising areas in blockchain, the recent developments serve as a stark reminder of the volatility that can arise from international relations.
