            "description": "<div class=\"RichTextArticleBody RichTextBody\">\n<p>While stocks like <b>Nvidia (NVDA)</b>, <b>Tesla (TSLA)</b>, and <b>Netflix (NFLX)</b> have garnered much of the attention of traders over the last two years for their monster stock gains, many traders are now focused on finding the next NVDA, and I think there is a chance that <b>Palantir (PLTR</b>) could fit that bill. Here is why …</p><p> </p><p>PLTR stock exploded higher by approximately 23% following the release of <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.investors.com/news/technology/palantir-stock-pltr-stock-palantir-earnings-q42024/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">its earnings report on Monday night</a></span>. The short version of why the stock reacted so well to earnings is that PLTR is in the perfect spot for the potential AI revolution. My fellow Cabot Analyst Mike Cintolo summarized it well when he previously summarized the stock for his <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.cabotwealth.com/subscription-offers/cabot-top-ten-trader/\"><i>Cabot Top Ten Trader</i></a></span> subscribers:</p><p> [text_ad]</p><p><i>Palantir has seemed perfectly positioned for the AI boom ... The company’s history as a provider of advanced software and analytical/security platforms for government entities (especially U.S. and friendly militaries) means it’s been leveraging various forms of AI and machine learning for years, putting it way ahead of others when it comes to developing a platform that can be mass adopted not just by governments, but by big companies looking to dramatically streamline operations.</i></p><p>In Q4, EPS rose 75%, driven by a 64% jump in U.S. commercial revenue and a 45% increase in U.S. government revenue.</p><p>Palantir also guided to FY 2025 revenue of $3.75 billion, ahead of analyst expectations of $3.5 billion.</p><p>And while the company story and potential are impressive, of much greater interest to me is the wild call buying activity since the earnings report. Here is a small sample of this bullish option activity from February 4:</p><p> <br/>Buyer of 1,500 PLTR July 125 Calls for $11.50 – Stock at 105</p><p>Buyer of 1,100 PLTR March 80 Calls for $27 – Stock at 105</p><p>Buyer of 3,000 PLTR May 150 Calls for $3.70 – Stock at 102</p><p>Buyer of 1,000 PLTR September 125 Calls for $14 – Stock at 102</p><p> </p><p>There have been plenty more call buying trades today, but I think you get the point … options traders are expecting the stock to move higher.</p><p> </p><p>And in fact, what makes this call buying interesting, outside of the big premiums spent is that this call buying could create a self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts for the stock to move higher. This is what I mean:</p><p>Back in the day when I was an options market maker on the floor of the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE),<b> </b>when a broker came into my crowd and bought calls, I would sell him those calls and then immediately buy stock to hedge off that call sale.</p><p>If I sold 10 calls, I might buy 500 shares to hedge. If I sold 2,000 calls, I might buy 10,000 shares … it really depended on which calls I was selling. This was simple hedging.</p><p>Now, as we got closer to expiration, if those 2,000 calls I sold were likely to finish in the money I would have to buy more and more stock as it became more and more likely that I would be short stock on expiration via the exercise of those 2,000 calls.</p><p>So how are we seeing this in PLTR?</p><p>The call buying in PLTR is off the charts in terms of size. And every time a trader buys 1,000 calls, or 2,000 calls, or any number of calls, the market maker who sold those calls has to buy stock, which pushes the stock higher.</p><p>As the stock moves higher the likelihood of those calls that were sold finishing in the money increases, and the market maker then has to buy more and more stock. It almost becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy pushing the stock higher.</p><p>I bring this up to highlight that as we continue to see WILD call buying, the likelihood of PLTR stock moving higher will continue to improve … though as always with any stock, and especially in the highly controversial AI investing world, only time will tell whether PLTR is the next NVDA, or just another overhyped bubble stock. Should be interesting!</p><p>Jacob’s <i>Cabot Options Trader </i>subscribers closed out Palantir (PLTR) calls in January for an 864% gain; <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.cabotwealth.com/subscription-offers/cabot-options-trader/\">for more information about joining them, click here</a></span>.</p><p>[author_ad]</p>\n</div>",

And while final numbers are not yet published, in 2023, the nation’s company execs saw their income grow by 23%, and although 2024 income growth is expected to rise at a slower pace, I’m not worrying about how those folks are putting food on their tables.</p><p> </p><p>But what’s going on? Through November, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas reported that 327 top bosses had left their jobs—8.6% higher than in 2023 and more than any other year since 2010 (when they first started tracking this stat).</p><p>[text_ad]</p><p>Here are some of the most well-known companies who lost their CEOs last year:</p><p> </p><p>· <i>Boeing</i>—need I say more?</p><p>· <i>Nike</i> (sluggish growth)</p><p>· <i>Starbucks</i> (declining sales in its largest markets)</p><p>· <i>Intel</i> (falling behind on A.I.)</p><p>· <i>Peloton</i> (revolving door in the C suite, due mostly to crazy COVID growth retreating to a slower pace when the work-at-home employees were called back to the office)</p><p>· <i>Kohl’s</i> (dropping same-store sales for 11 quarters in a row)</p><p>· <i>WW International</i> (blame it on the easier-to-lose weight drugs like Wegovy.

And if the company doesn’t immediately replace the CEO, I’d opt out.</p><p> </p><p>However, if the company is quick to hire a CEO that shareholders hold in high esteem—such as a person with a great track record in turnarounds, many years of expertise as a CEO, or at least a successful history in management positions in similar industries—that may be a great sign of future upward momentum in the share price.

            "description": "<div class=\"RichTextArticleBody RichTextBody\">\n<p>Whew!</p><p> </p><p>We’re a month into the new year and – good, bad and indifferent – there’s no denying it has been chockfull of big developments.</p><p> </p><p>Just this past week we saw tech stocks take a big hit, only to turn around and recover much of it the next day on the <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.cabotwealth.com/cabot-street-check-podcast/deepseek-explained-and-why-its-good-for-the-market-cabot-street-check-video\">DeepSeek scare</a></span>. That story is still being written, but I think it’s safe to say there was some overreacting that was probably a reflection of some of the nervousness caused by the high multiples these stocks had enjoyed throughout 2024.</p><p> </p><p>And of course, inflation has ticked back up, and this week the Fed announced it would hold rates at 4.25-4.5%. Like the rest of us, the Fed recognized that the downward trend in inflation over 2024 could be subject to change. The Fed acknowledged progress towards the 2% inflation goal while also noting the need to pause to see how Trump administration policies unfold. As I’ve noted previously, high tariffs and mass deportations would both have substantial inflationary effects depending on if and how they are implemented.</p><p>The Fed noted that the continued strength in employment numbers gives them the luxury of taking a wait-and-see approach on further adjustments to rates. Stay tuned.</p><p>[text_ad]</p><p>As I talk with colleagues here at Cabot and across the industry, I hear, what is largely a consensus, an expectation that the early part of this year may see some correction, consolidation and profit-taking that will see some stocks getting hit after such a strong year.</p><p> </p><p>In addition, my conversations indicate there’s a broad sense that the new administration in the White House will still be getting settled in for most of the first half of the year. As we have seen, that doesn’t mean they’re sitting around doing nothing. Only that the policies that will have a bigger impact on the economy and stock market are not likely to emerge in the early months. That said, expecting the unexpected is part of the Trump playbook, so stay tuned.</p><p> </p><p>I hasten to note that the sharp minds I am in touch with are overwhelmingly positive about the prospects for 2025. Whether it’s as strong as 2024 or not is unknowable at this point, but even if not, we could still have a very strong year.</p><p> </p><h2><b>Let’s Talk About Crypto</b></h2><p>Cryptocurrency is enjoying another moment at this time. Fortunes have been made and lost on crypto already and it continues to edge its way into the mainstream more each day.</p><p> </p><p>Serious investors can tell me they don’t have any crypto holdings and I think that is fine. At the same time, I know plenty of people I consider to be serious investors who have crypto in their portfolio and I’m ok with that, as long as they’re cognizant of the volatility and the risks.</p><p> </p><p>I am a true believer in the advantages and savings that blockchain technology will bring to our economy and society in the coming years. My views on cryptocurrencies, which have blockchain underpinnings, however, are more muted. I don’t think it’s all a sham, but it has clearly attracted some shady characters, so there is reason to be cautious.</p><p> </p><p>Of greatest relevance for you, my reader, is the appropriate place for crypto in an investment portfolio, if any. The first thing investors should be aware of is there are different categories of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The primary group of cryptocurrencies are those with a fundamental financial or technological utility. These include:</p><p></p><p>1) <b>Payment cryptos </b>like <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.cabotwealth.com/daily/growth-stocks/bitcoin-stocks-to-buy-crypto-all-time-highs\">Bitcoin</a></span>, Dogecoin, Litecoin and others generally have a finite number of coins. In theory, and increasingly in reality, such coins can be used as a way to pay for any kind of goods, services or other financial obligations.</p><p></p><p>2) <b>Utility tokens</b> (also sometimes called Infrastructure tokens) include most notably Ethereum. These have a specific function for which they are created and do not have a finite number of coins. So, like a governmental currency when a lot more gets printed, these will tend to be inflationary over time.</p><p></p><p>3) <b>Stablecoins </b>have their value tied to a traditional currency (sometimes referred to as fiat currencies because governments can increase or decrease the supply at their fiat), typically the U.S. dollar or the Euro. Tether is the best-known and biggest stablecoin. These avoid the drastic and sudden swings in valuation that we hear about so often with payment cryptos. But, these still aren’t guaranteed. TerraUSD was a stablecoin that collapsed because the holdings backing it up were in risky assets.</p><p>One form of stablecoin is <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/central-bank-digital-currency.htm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC)</a></span> which are issued by a country and tied to the value of their currency. These are in the very early stages but expect to hear more in the coming years as there are advantages in terms of stability and traceability.</p><p> </p><p>The second group, which has been back in the news recently, is called <b>Meme Coins</b> because they are typically tied to some cultural fad (or meme). Unlike the group above, these do not have any underlying intrinsic value. Many of these are started on a whim, or as a joke.</p><p> </p><p>In effect, these are collectibles that are purchased from the issuing party, who immediately makes money. Everyone else beware. As long as interest and demand stay high, you MAY be able to resell them for more than you purchased them.</p><p> </p><p>But don’t count on it.</p><p> </p><p>At some point, the music will stop and someone will be left holding these coins that no longer have a market. If this is your idea of entertainment or if you want to support a cause of the issuing party, then buy them. Just don’t think of them as an investment.</p><p> </p><p>The next thing to think about with crypto is that it generally aligns with bull markets. When the stock market is running strong, crypto tends to do well. When the market turns down, crypto does too, sometimes quite hard.</p><h2><b>Cabot’s 5 Rules for Investing in Crypto</b></h2><p>1) <b>Do NOT invest in Meme Coins.</b> These aren’t investments. I’m not saying don’t buy them (although I won’t), just that you should not consider these to be part of your investment portfolio.</p><p></p><p>2) <b>Do your due diligence</b> before buying any crypto. Is it solid? What is the value based on? What is the underlying thesis?</p><p></p><p>3) <b>Buy early in bull markets.</b> Wait until the trend has been clearly established. Once you’ve bought, watch closely. Be prepared to sell much, or even all, of the position, upon a sharp rise. Take your profits and move on. And put a pause on your buying when the market turns bearish.</p><p></p><p>4) <b>Don’t get greedy.</b> Investors often hate to sell only to see an asset continue to rise in value, but it’s better to sell before a peak and lock in profits than leave the party too late, having watched the value fall off a cliff. I see this all the time with equities and it’s an even bigger risk with crypto because of the greater volatility.</p><p></p><p>5) <b>Consider buying and holding.</b> If you think crypto is destined to gradually ratchet up in value in the long run, you can buy early in a bull run or on any substantial dip. If that’s your strategy, don’t check the value every day. You’ll drive yourself crazy as you see sometimes massive fluctuations up and down (ouch!). If this is your strategy, I recommend buying quality – Bitcoin or Ethereum would be at the top of my list.</p><p>If you are following a buy-and-hold strategy, that can be an exception to buying only in bull markets. As with any buy-and-hold strategy, a dollar-cost-averaging approach where you buy a set amount each month can be appropriate here.</p><p>[author_ad]</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"RichTextArticleBody RichTextBody\">\n<p>I’m not huge into New Year’s resolutions; if something is good enough to adopt, in life or investing, there’s no reason to wait until the calendar flips. Indeed, I sort of liken the start of the year to the start of a football game—most teams start the first quarter with a well-thought-out game plan, but within a few drives, the script often goes out the window, with coaches and players scrambling to do whatever they can to win.</p><p>It’s not dissimilar when investing, as most people start out with a handful of goals and targets for the year … but within a few weeks, most of those are forgotten as we adjust to what the market throws at us. (In fact, not only have most people already thrown out those New Year’s resolutions, but there’s even a holiday for it: National Quitter’s Day, which falls on the second Friday of January.)</p><p>[text_ad]</p><p>So let me just briefly chime in today with a few big-picture growth investing strategies to consider now that those pesky New Year’s resolutions have fallen to the wayside:</p><h2><b>5 Growth Investing Strategies for 2025</b></h2><ol class=\"rte2-style-ol\" start=\"1\"><li><p><b>Forget about Last Year</b>: In 2024, I was a hero, up 58% in my <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.cabotwealth.com/subscription-offers/cabot-growth-investor/\"><i>Cabot Growth Investor</i></a></span> advisory’s Model Portfolio. As you may have gathered based on the bull market, 2023 was another good year. </p><p>But in 2022, I was heavily in cash, helping subscribers avoid much of the bear market, and in 2021, I was a dud, up just single digits as growth stocks lagged and (frankly) I made some snafus. </p><p>But whether you were a hero or a zero last year, that was last year—put it on your long-term track record, sure, but don’t rest on your laurels (if you did great) or sulk (if you did poorly).

Long story short, remember to cut your losses but aim big (or at least bigger) with your winners.</p></li><li><p><b>Choose the Best, Leave the Rest</b>: Sometimes, the market environment is such that you can throw a dart and make money; we all love those times. But this … isn’t one of those times. </p><p>You don’t have to invest in blue chips, of course, but it’s almost always best to avoid the junk pile—for growth stocks, stick with those that have great stories, numbers and (at least resilient) charts, and let others toy with the speculative stuff that often tempts but usually disappoints. (A side benefit of this is you’ll have more conviction in the stuff you own, which will allow you to hold on through normal, tedious shakeouts—which in turn will allow you to develop bigger winners.)</p></li><li><p><b>Follow a Plan</b>: There is no perfect plan, just like there is no perfect investing system. But you’ll come out better if you have some roadmap that guides you rather than just going with your emotion. </p><p>Obviously, if the evidence really changes (huge crack of support, trend change in the market, etc.), you should change as well—but for the most part, it’ll be best to let things develop.</p></li><li><p><b>Stay Optimistic</b>: I’ve been at Cabot now for a quarter century, and of course, invested some before that, and during that time I’ve seen two of the biggest bear markets ever, a terrorist attack on our country, various wars and skirmishes, a housing/financial meltdown, rising interest rates, huge natural disasters, presidential impeachments, an oil crash, a trade war with the second biggest economy in the world, massive fiscal deficits and a pandemic. </p><p>Through it all, our standard of living has (generally) gone up and the market has presented some great opportunities—especially in firms offering new, cutting-edge technologies and products. There are down times, but let there be no doubt that there will be great opportunities ahead. So be sure to keep your eyes open for them, and apply these growth investing strategies when managing your portfolio.</p></li></ol><p>As for the current market, January is often volatile and tricky, and 2025 has been no different, with a good-sized selling wave soon after the calendar flipped, a nice two-week bounce and then, this week, plenty of tumultuous action, highlighted by the plunge in AI infrastructure stocks and various crosscurrents under the surface.</p><p>Most of the evidence right now is neutral—there are positives, but most indexes are basically rangebound, including growth measures.</p><p>So, with some leading growth stocks toying with resistance, we’re keeping our eyes peeled for evidence that big investors are stepping back up to the plate. </p><p>[author_ad]<br/></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"RichTextArticleBody RichTextBody\">\n<p>As has been the case for the past decade, the fate of cannabis stocks lies largely in the hands of politicians.</p><p> </p><p>Cannabis companies have been getting solid support from state-level politicians. Forty states now allow sales of medical cannabis.</p><p> </p><p>Sure, they are permitting too many stores, and that is putting downward pressure on pricing. At some point, the market sorts that out. Prices will fall to a point where it is no longer that enticing to bring on new supply, yet companies will have gotten lean enough to produce profits. We are not there yet. But we will get there.</p><p> </p><p>At the federal level, it has been a rockier ride. Cannabis investors got their hopes up under the Biden administration when the government seemed to be aggressively advancing rescheduling, which would instantly make cannabis companies more profitable by opening the range of allowed deductions against federal taxes.</p><p> </p><p>The Biden administration ultimately let the cannabis sector down. Now, it’s up to President Donald Trump. <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.cabotwealth.com/daily/cannabis-stocks/future-of-cannabis-hands-of-donald-trump\">He promised in his campaign to achieve rescheduling and implement SAFER banking reform that allows banks to work with cannabis companies.</a></span> He even implicitly favored legalization, by supporting a Florida referendum that would have achieved this.</p><p> </p><p>I’ll continue to take Trump at his word and invest under the assumption that he will get around to his promised cannabis reforms. The challenge is, he has a busy agenda and cannabis reform is not at the top of his list of goals. But sooner or later, his Department of Justice will get around to rescheduling. That will be a big catalyst for cannabis stocks.</p><p>[text_ad]</p><p>Near term, the hearing process inside the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has been stalled over legal disputes about DEA behavior and its role as an advocate for rescheduling, given its apparent opposition to reform. This delay is not a bad thing. It pushes back action on rescheduling until Trump can get his people in place at the DEA and in DOJ leadership.</p><p> </p><p>At least one industry CEO remains optimistic on the prospects for progress.</p><p><b> </b></p><p>“You are seeing action,” <b>Cresco Labs (CRLBF)</b> CEO Charlie Bachtell said in a recent interview with the cannabis podcast AlphaNooner. “At the inaugural celebration they even had a desk on stage and he was signing executive orders that day in that arena. So, objectively looking at it, this seems like an administration that is going to take action on issues that Trump brought up along the campaign trail,” said Bachtell. “Fortunately for us, cannabis has been part of that narrative. There were three very public statements where he laid out his evolved position on our subject matter. What I took from it is that a common-sense approach is needed for cannabis and the industry is ready.”</p><p> </p><p>While the federal government dallies, states will continue to make progress on favorable reform.</p><p> </p><p>Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) recently reiterated he wants <b>Pennsylvania</b> to legalize recreational cannabis use so that his state stops giving up tax revenue to Maryland, Ohio, New York and New Jersey. Pennsylvania residents cross state lines to buy in those states. Polls show a majority of voters in the state favor the change.</p><p> <br/><b>Hawaiian</b> lawmakers are taking another shot at legalizing recreational-use cannabis. In late January, House Judiciary and Hawaiian Affairs Chair David Tarnas (D) and Senate Health and Human Services Committee Chair Joy San Buenaventura (D) filed a bill that would allow adults to purchase rec-use cannabis.</p><p> </p><p><b>Smart &amp; Safe Florida</b> has filed to put <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.wusf.org/politics-issues/2025-01-16/new-proposal-recreational-marijuana-emerges-planned-2026-ballot\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">another recreational-use cannabis referendum on the Florida ballot in 2026</a></span>. A Smart &amp; Safe Florida referendum that would have legalized recreational cannabis, called Amendment 3, failed last year. In a major setback for cannabis investors, the referendum got 56% of the vote, below the 60% needed for approval.</p><p> </p><p><b>The bottom line</b>: The potential Florida vote is over a year away, and it is hard to predict when change will really happen in other states. We also don’t know when federal reform will play out. So, cannabis investors need patience. But there is a tactical step you can take to make the wait easier. “Get paid to wait” by owning cannabis sector companies that pay rich yields but will post capital appreciation if reform progresses. I own and I’m suggesting two that pay yields of 16.3% and 12.4%.

            "title": "Testing the “Golden Cross” and “Death Cross” on the SPY",
            "description": "<div class=\"RichTextArticleBody RichTextBody\">\n<p>The investing community is surprisingly divided on the usefulness of technical analysis, so today I wanted to put a few classic scenarios to the test. Namely, the “Golden Cross” and the “Death Cross.”</p><p>Both of these are moving average crossovers. The “Golden Cross” occurs when a stock or index’s 50-day moving average crosses up and over its 200-day moving average. The “Death Cross” is the inverse, where the 50-day line crosses below the 200-day.</p><p>Both events indicate that shorter-term price action (momentum) has overpowered the longer-term trend, with the expectation that the longer-term trend will follow suit. In other words, a bullish cross signals that short-term price action is favorable and the expectation is that it will precede a rising longer-term average (and continued rising share prices).</p><p>By that same token, the “Death Cross” indicates that short-term price action is overwhelming support levels and points to even lower prices ahead.</p><p>[text_ad]</p><p>Some analysts, like my former value-investing colleague Bruce Kaser, view technical analysis as little more than lines on a screen (online communities derisively refer to it as “crayon drawings”). If you’re a value investor, price movements are an opportunity to buy when the market is undervaluing your stocks or sell when the market is overvaluing them. In either case, the value of the underlying company is unchanged. Benjamin Graham used the analogy “<span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.cabotwealth.com/daily/value-stocks/benjamin-grahams-mr-market\">Mr. Market</a></span>” to explain that viewpoint.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum are the high-paced day traders who can trade anything under the sun if they’ve got the right combination of technical indicators and studies. Most individual day traders do not beat the market.</p><p>As for Cabot, our analysts fall somewhere in the middle, but Mike Cintolo’s approach to technicals is a healthy one. Just one piece of the puzzle to be used in a more holistic approach. In <i>Cabot Growth Investor</i>, Mike will sometimes refer to the “SNaC” approach, which is to say the “Story, Numbers and Chart.” The <i>chart</i> doesn’t tell the whole story, but it tells part of it.</p><p>To find out who’s right, let’s dive into some numbers on the <b>S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY)</b> using moving average crossovers as buy and sell signals.</p><h2>Testing the “Golden Cross” and “Death Cross” as Buy and Sell Signals</h2><div class=\"Enhancement ImageEnhancement\" data-align-center=\"\">\n<div class=\"Enhancement-item\">\n<figure class=\"Figure\">\n<a class=\"AnchorLink\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" id=\"image-870000\" name=\"image-870000\"></a>\n<picture>\n<source height=\"310\" media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" srcset=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/d35e556/2147483647/strip/true/crop/990x511+0+0/resize/600x310!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F71%2F66%2F28c9f93640139e7405a5098f1384%2Fspy-3.png 1x,https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/f1b7f19/2147483647/strip/true/crop/990x511+0+0/resize/1200x620!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F71%2F66%2F28c9f93640139e7405a5098f1384%2Fspy-3.png 2x\" type=\"image/webp\" width=\"600\"/>\n<source height=\"310\" media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" srcset=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/7e4c4a1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/990x511+0+0/resize/600x310!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F71%2F66%2F28c9f93640139e7405a5098f1384%2Fspy-3.png\" width=\"600\"/>\n<source height=\"239\" srcset=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/b23f23d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/990x511+0+0/resize/464x239!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F71%2F66%2F28c9f93640139e7405a5098f1384%2Fspy-3.png 1x\" type=\"image/webp\" width=\"464\"/>\n<source height=\"239\" srcset=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/6b16937/2147483647/strip/true/crop/990x511+0+0/resize/464x239!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F71%2F66%2F28c9f93640139e7405a5098f1384%2Fspy-3.png\" width=\"464\"/>\n<img alt=\"Five-year Chart of S&amp;P 500 ETF SPY, with 50-day moving average, 200-day moving average showing death cross and golden cross.png\" class=\"Image\" height=\"239\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/6b16937/2147483647/strip/true/crop/990x511+0+0/resize/464x239!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F71%2F66%2F28c9f93640139e7405a5098f1384%2Fspy-3.png\" srcset=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/6b16937/2147483647/strip/true/crop/990x511+0+0/resize/464x239!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F71%2F66%2F28c9f93640139e7405a5098f1384%2Fspy-3.png 1x\" width=\"464\"/>\n</picture>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div><p>For our exercise, we’ll compare performance over the last five years. A golden cross will trigger a buy on the next trading day at the open. A death cross will trigger a sell on the next trading day, also at the open.</p><p>As you can see on the chart above, there are four instances where the 50-day moving average crossed over the 200-day moving average in the last five years (we’re using simple moving averages; you can read more about <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.cabotwealth.com/daily/how-to-invest/moving-averages-smas-vs-emas\">the distinction between simple and exponential moving averages at this link</a></span>).</p><p>We’ll compare that performance to simply buying the SPY five years ago.</p><h3><b>The Performance of Buy-and-Hold</b></h3><p>If you bought the SPY on January 27, 2020, and held it until today, an initial investment of $10,000 would be worth $19,997, a return of 99.96%, or 14.85% annually (assuming you reinvest dividends).</p><p>You’ve doubled your money in five years, which is great and exceeds the long-term average returns of large-cap stocks.</p><h3><b>The Performance of Market Timing with the Golden and Death Crosses</b></h3><p>Right off the bat, we’re faced with a conundrum: Should we invest in the SPY? If we’re using golden crosses as our entry triggers, what do we do when our first trigger is a death cross (sell) in March of 2020, two months after our window begins?</p><p>That’s a very real concern, and one we’ll discuss later, but for now, we’ll track two performance numbers: One in which you buy on the first trading day of our period because the last event was a buy signal (50-day line over the 200-day line means the last signal we would have gotten is a golden cross), and a second where we do not buy until a subsequent crossover tells us to.</p><p>Here are the results of both of those scenarios (both assume dividend reinvestment as well):<br/></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"MsoNormalTable\"

of our exercise and then subsequently followed buy and sell signals (scenario 1), you would have drastically underperformed simply buying and holding.</p><p>If, on the other hand, you had exclusively used crossovers as your buy and sell signals, you would have enjoyed better returns than buying and holding and you would have done so in a shorter period of time, potentially freeing up capital for other investments or, at the very least, generating additional returns on free cash.</p><p>Using the golden cross/death cross combination would have netted a 116% return over five years without factoring in cash returns, making it the hands-down winner.</p><p>What can we, as investors, take away from this? For passive investors, the old adage that “time in the market beats timing the market” is a good rule of thumb. If you have no plans to actively manage your account other than periodically rebalancing your 401(k) or IRA, your best bet is to just put your money to work.</p><p>But, if you’re an active investor who’s trading within a well-defined system, it is possible to outperform the market.</p><p>In our example, even the biggest “loser” (scenario 1) did fairly well, generating a 63% return in just five years. But that scenario is emblematic of a problem that many aspiring traders fall victim to – namely, inconsistent use of (or deviation from) a system.</p><p>In scenario 1, the initial purchase was made like a buy-and-hold investor, but all the subsequent trades were made based on technical indicators. By mixing systems, scenario 1 generated 53% lower absolute returns over the last five years than scenario 2, and 36% lower returns than buying and holding.</p><p>If that investor had simply sat on their hands and waited for a buy signal (scenario 2) they would have done even better than someone that bought and held.</p><p>To sum it up, stick to your system, whatever that may be.</p><p>[author_ad]<br/></p>\n</div>",

Indeed, spending on new tractors, harvesters and other equipment has been trending lower in the last few years, with a corresponding oversupply of used equipment complicating matters.</p><p> </p><p>But as commodity prices improve, farm incomes will increase which, in turn, typically raises demand for equipment investment among growers. Moreover, there are indications that older equipment needs replacing on many smaller and mid-sized farms, which will further serve as a stimulus to new equipment spending if the ag commodity rebound gains traction.</p><p> </p><p>Also, with the prices for many commonly used nitrogen- and phosphate-based fertilizers stabilizing, farmers should have a lower input cost burden this year, further making allowance for more of their budgets to be spent on new equipment.</p><p> </p><p>For investors interested in participating in a potential ag sector rebound, one stock in particular is worth looking at.

            "description": "<div class=\"RichTextArticleBody RichTextBody\">\n<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a critical driving force behind the current bull market and, given the veritable torrent of artificial intelligence talk by tech companies, one would think that Wall Street would be beating down the doors of any AI investment worth its salt.</p><p>And while that’s largely true, there is one AI infrastructure investment that the market has been seemingly ignoring the whole time.</p><p>Water.</p><p>[text_ad]</p><p>There are credible estimates that a single interaction with the various AI chat models (5-50 queries; so perhaps a single question and a few follow-ups or a brief “conversation”) consumes 500ml of (primarily) potable water, the equivalent of a typical bottle of water.</p><p>In their <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://sustainability.google/reports/google-2024-environmental-report/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2024 Environmental Report</a></span>, Google alone disclosed that their water consumption in 2023 was 6.4 billion gallons, up from 5.6 billion gallons the year before.</p><p>And they’re not alone. Microsoft saw similar spikes in its own water consumption, which rose from 1.69 billion gallons in 2022 to 2.07 billion gallons in 2023 (a 22.5% increase) according to its <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/sustainability/report\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Environmental Sustainability Report</a></span>.</p><p>The water consumption in question is owed largely to the proliferation of large (hyperscale) data centers, which consume huge quantities of water for cooling and humidity management, to say nothing of water consumed by chipmakers in the production of those data center chips. (Global chipmaker water consumption is estimated to rival that of the city of Hong Kong and its 7.5 million residents.)</p><p>Water use (and thus its role in AI Infrastructure) is ubiquitous amongst large tech companies, with Amazon (for their web arm, AWS), Meta Platforms and Apple also using billions of gallons annually.</p><p>Now, to give the (thirsty) devils their due, four of the five companies listed above (excluding Apple) have committed to becoming either water-neutral or water-positive (returning more water to the ground than they consume) by 2030.</p><p>But with data center growth (and water consumption) showing no signs of slowing down, there’s a case to be made that parched server farms are turning water into an AI infrastructure investment in its own right.</p><p>The downside of taking the water angle on AI is that you’re unlikely to experience the massive speculative upside of a pure-play AI investment such as a software company or chipmaker.</p><p>The upside, however, is that it’s a more conservative angle that’s less likely to get caught up in the market’s AI-driven hype cycle.</p><p>Plus, it’s more straightforward. It doesn’t matter which platform is the better AI image generator, nor does it matter whether Google’s Gemini (nee Bard) gobbles up market share from OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Microsoft’s Copilot. All of them will be slurping up groundwater for years to come.</p><p>Investors looking to put a little water weight into their portfolios would be well-served by any number of ETFs. The <b>First Trust Water ETF (FIW)</b> is a fund we’ve <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.cabotwealth.com/daily/dividend-stocks/water-stocks-etfs-global-water-crisis\">written about before</a></span>. With $1.8 billion (give or take) in assets under management (AUM), it also happens to be one of the larger water-focused funds. It’s up 13.6% in the last year with an expense ratio of about 0.5% and a modest yield of 0.7%. This fund broadly invests in companies that derive the majority of their revenues from potable and wastewater services.</p><p>The <b>Invesco Water Resources ETF (PHO)</b> is an equally large ($2.2 billion AUM) fund with a similar yield and expense ratio (both right around 0.6%) but is a more concentrated portfolio that prioritizes water conservation and purification. It’s also modestly outperforming FIW, up 14.0% in the last year.</p><p>The<b> Invesco S&amp;P Global Water Index ETF (CGW) </b>is a slightly smaller fund ($900 million AUM) that has comparable expenses, but a higher yield (1.5%) and lower one-year returns (up 6.6%). CGW invests globally in the largest companies in the water business and thus offers more exposure to utilities (hence the higher yield and lower performance).</p><p>Global water management is likely to have long-term tailwinds as the climate changes and, for now at least, it also happens to be the one AI infrastructure investment that the market is ignoring.</p><p>[author_ad]</p>\n</div>",
