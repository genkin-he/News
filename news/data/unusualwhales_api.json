Sales for the U.S. drugmaker amounted to $17.76 billion, reflecting a 22% rise year-over-year (or 21% operationally), exceeding the anticipated $17.40 billion. This surge is attributed to various factors including a one-time, non-cash Paxlovid revenue reversal of $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, growth contributions from the legacy Seagen portfolio, the Vyndaqel family, increased Paxlovid sales compared to the previous year, higher sales in multiple product categories, and a favorable foreign exchange impact. Excluding Paxlovid and Comirnaty contributions, the fourth-quarter 2024 revenues reached $13.7 billion, showcasing substantial growth.",
