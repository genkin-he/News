The abrupt selling activity by foreign central banks post-election is seen as a potential warning sign and test. This massive sell-off, which amounted to $100 billion, indicates the economic power held by countries unfriendly to U.S. interests with their significant holdings of U.S. treasuries. This event likely contributed to the surge in Treasury yields and the instability in the stock market observed in late December and early January. Elliott's assessment highlights the size of the sell-off comparable to U.S. debt issuance. The development raises concerns about escalating tensions and the impact on international economic relations.",

Analysts had predicted sales to be around $9.58 billion. Vaccine sales saw a significant drop of 14% (equivalent to -11% at constant currency) amounting to 2.21 billion pounds, mainly due to reduced demand for Arexvy following a restricted ACIP recommendation in the U.S. Arexvy sales plummeted by 70% to 158 million pounds. Conversely, meningitis vaccines had a successful sales year, registering double-digit growth in all regions, totaling 295 million pounds. Established vaccine sales showed positive growth to 806 million pounds, with international and U.S. markets contributing to the increase. The impact of COVID-19 was also noted on the performance of the vaccines. More details regarding this news can be found on Benzinga.com.",
