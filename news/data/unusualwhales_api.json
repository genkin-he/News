However, strong quarterly earnings reports and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s less hawkish stance compared to December encouraged bullish sentiment, resulting in a market rebound. In line with expectations, the Federal Reserve maintained interest rates at 4.25%\u20134.5%. Powell surprisingly hinted at potential future rate cuts, describing current monetary policy as \"meaningfully restrictive.\" Nvidia Corp.
