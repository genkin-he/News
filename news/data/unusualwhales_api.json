In a post on Truth Social, Trump promised to address inflation by increasing energy production and cutting regulations if he is elected. He disapproved of the Fed's focus on climate initiatives and diversity programs. This critique came after the Federal Open Market Committee kept rates steady, ending a series of three cuts that began in September. Trump expressed his dissatisfaction with the Fed's bank regulation policies and vowed that his administration would facilitate more lending for Americans and businesses through regulatory reforms led by the Treasury.",

This prompted investors to question the need for investing in higher-cost AI companies, causing top chipmakers and data center stocks to plummet. However, strong quarterly earnings reports and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s less hawkish stance compared to December encouraged bullish sentiment, resulting in a market rebound. In line with expectations, the Federal Reserve maintained interest rates at 4.25%\u20134.5%. Powell surprisingly hinted at potential future rate cuts, describing current monetary policy as \"meaningfully restrictive.\" Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) suffered, dropping approximately 15% over the week and declining further on Friday following additional reports.",
