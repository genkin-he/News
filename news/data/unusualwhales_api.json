The Q4 revenue was reported at $7.66 billion, surpassing estimates of $7.53 billion. Adjusted EPS for the same period was $1.09, slightly higher than the estimated $1.08. The total revenue saw a 12% increase year-over-year, driven by Data Center revenue of $3.9 billion, showing a significant 69% rise compared to the previous year. Despite this growth, the Data Center figures fell short of analysts' expectations of $4.14 billion. The underperformance in the Data Center segment seems to be the key factor contributing to the stock's drop as investors focus on AI growth. Multiple analysts have also reduced price targets following the financial report.",
