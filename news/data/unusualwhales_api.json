(NASDAQ:PLUG) experienced a decline in trading on Monday after Seaport Global analyst Tom Curran downgraded the rating from Neutral to Sell, setting a price forecast of $1. In a recent update on the clean hydrogen sector in September, Curran highlighted concerns regarding low post-FID activity and an imbalanced pipeline favoring supply. The analyst noted negative developments in North America and Europe, which account for 93% of the company's projected 2024 revenue. Specifically, in the U.S., President Trump's executive order \"Unleashing American Energy\" triggered a 90-day review of the DOE's H2Hubs program, jeopardizing approximately $8 billion in grants. This scrutiny has left much of the funding at risk, as per Curran's assessment. For further details, the complete story is accessible on Benzinga.com.",
