Additionally, the report highlights a 1.2% decrease in the manufacturing sector, attributing it to ongoing supply chain disruptions. Despite this, overall economic growth is expected to continue in the coming months. The positive trend in the technology and service sectors has contributed to the creation of over 1.5 million new jobs globally, providing a much-needed boost to the labor market. The outlook for the global economy remains optimistic, with projections indicating a further 3.5% growth in the next quarter. This promising forecast suggests that the economic recovery is well underway, offering hope for continued progress in the post-pandemic era.",
