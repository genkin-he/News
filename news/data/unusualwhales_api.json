This figure represents a significant drop from the previous year's rate of 4.2%. The decrease in unemployment has been attributed to strong economic growth and increased job opportunities in various sectors. Additionally, the report highlighted that the number of new jobs created in the last quarter alone exceeded 300,000, signaling a positive trend in the labor market. Experts believe that sustained efforts to boost employment and stimulate the economy have contributed to this favorable outcome.
