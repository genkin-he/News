The ADP National Employment Report by Automatic Data Processing Inc. unveiled this news, illustrating the persistent strength in the private labor sector. With the upcoming non-farm payrolls report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there is anticipation of a hiring slowdown. Economists predict a decrease from 256,000 new jobs in December to 170,000. Reflecting on this data, Nela Richardson, ADP's chief economist, noted a disparity in the labor market where consumer-oriented industries led hiring, while business services and production sectors exhibited weaker job growth.
