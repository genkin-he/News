This decline has resulted in a loss of around $935 billion in export revenues from tourism, impacting various sectors worldwide. As countries continue to face travel restrictions and lockdown measures, the tourism industry is expected to face continued challenges in the coming months. Despite ongoing vaccination efforts, the recovery of the tourism sector is predicted to be slow and gradual. The World Travel and Tourism Council has called for collaborative efforts between governments, businesses, and international organizations to support the recovery of the tourism industry and mitigate its long-term impact.",

With Iran still exporting around 1.3 million barrels per day mainly to China, global oil supply may tighten abruptly. In the past, when Trump enforced Iranian sanctions completely, oil prices surged past $80. Initially, oil prices fell on concerns over Chinese trade measures against U.S. tariffs but rebounded following news of potential sanctions on Iran. The full story is available on Benzinga.com.",
