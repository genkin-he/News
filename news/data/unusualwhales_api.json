The company disclosed net sales of $10.9 billion for the six months ended December 2024, marking a slight 0.6% drop mainly due to adverse foreign exchange rates. Organic net sales, however, saw a 1.0% increase, supported by favorable price/mix adjustments, despite a mild 0.2% volume decline. Operating profit also fell by 4.9%, leading to a 132 basis point decrease in operating profit margin, influenced by currency fluctuations and decreased organic operating margins. Nevertheless, despite these challenges, Diageo managed to either sustain or expand market share in 65% of total net sales value in monitored markets, including the U.S.",
