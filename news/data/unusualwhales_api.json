The ADP National Employment Report by Automatic Data Processing Inc. unveiled this news, illustrating the persistent strength in the private labor sector. With the upcoming non-farm payrolls report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there is anticipation of a hiring slowdown. Economists predict a decrease from 256,000 new jobs in December to 170,000. Reflecting on this data, Nela Richardson, ADP's chief economist, noted a disparity in the labor market where consumer-oriented industries led hiring, while business services and production sectors exhibited weaker job growth. The detailed analysis of job growth in January can be found in the complete story on Benzinga.com.",
