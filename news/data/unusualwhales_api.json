The report highlights that warehousing expenses make up approximately 13% of overall supply chain costs, with last-mile delivery representing the largest portion at 41%. The Producer Price Index (PPI) for warehousing and storage services saw a 1.03% increase from August 2024 to December 2024. Ryan Martin, President of Distribution and Fulfillment at ITS Logistics, noted that this uptick may be influenced by various factors such as seasonal demand shifts, inflation, and rising operational costs like labor and energy. The construction of new storage facilities has decelerated, limiting available space according to a recent report in the Wall Street Journal.",
