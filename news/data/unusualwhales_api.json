This growth was primarily driven by the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, which saw a revenue increase of 13.6% to $74 billion. The rise in sales was attributed to market expansion, particularly in the GLP-1 class with products for diabetes and weight loss, as well as the sale of specialty products to healthcare providers. The company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) also saw an increase to $3.73, up by 13.7% compared to the previous year, exceeding the anticipated $3.50. Additionally, Cencora recently acquired the Retina Care Practice Network for $4.6 billion, and with better than expected Q4 earnings, they have raised their dividend.
