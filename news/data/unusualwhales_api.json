The median home price also saw a drop of 2.5% to $250,000. However, despite these declines, mortgage rates remained steady at an average of 4.2% for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. Economists believe this dip in sales and prices could be attributed to rising interest rates and a limited inventory of homes for sale in the market. They expect the market to stabilize in the coming months as the economy shows signs of recovery.",
