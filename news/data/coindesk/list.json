Ether (ETH) was lower by 5.3%.</p><p>The start of today's late tumble appeared to coincide with a crypto-related press conference held by White House crypto and AI czar David Sacks alongside the heads of key committees in the Senate and House.</p><p>Hopes that the press conference would center on the chances of a strategic bitcoin reserve were dashed as the discussion centered <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/02/04/trump-s-crypto-czar-sacks-says\">almost exclusively on regulatory matters and platitudes</a>.</p><p>Bitcoin did a get a mention at the end of the press conference, when — in response to a question — Sacks said that a White House working group on crypto is looking into the feasibility of a strategic bitcoin reserve. Asked if yesterday's executive order on creation of a sovereign wealth fund meant something for bitcoin, Sacks deferred, saying that's a question for Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick (who, along with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will be spearheading the SWF).</p><p>For now, it appears that bitcoin could be setting up for a retest of its Sunday evening low below the $92,000 level. Possibly bullish or bearish on the horizon will be Friday's U.S. January employment report. A soft number could have market participants pricing Federal Reserve rate cuts back into the outlook which could prove a boon to prices. Another strong print, though, might have investors pricing in a rate hike at some point this year  — absent other forces, a headwind to prices.</p></div>",
