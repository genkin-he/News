I look forward to broadening Susvimo’s impact to even more patients in my clinic.”<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup></p><p class=\"pb-2\">Susvimo was designed to provide continuous delivery of a customized formulation of ranibizumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor. The drug attaches to and inhibits VEGF-A, which research has found to play a crucial role in forming new blood vessels and in the leakiness of these vessels, according to Roche.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">The customized formulation of the drug that Susvimo delivers is different from the intravitreal injection, which is approved under the brand name Lucentis for the treatment of neovascular, or wet, age-related macular degeneration, as well as other retinal conditions.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">The efficacy of Susvimo was shown in two-year data from the confirmatory Phase III Pagoda trial (NCT04108156)<sup class=\"text-inherit\">2</sup> for the treatment of DME, as well as the Phase III Pavilion trial (NCT04503551) for diabetic retinopathy (DR).<sup class=\"text-inherit\">3</sup> </p><p class=\"pb-2\">The multicenter, randomized, visual assessor-masked, active-comparator Pagoda trial analyzed Susvimo refilled every six months vs. monthly administration of ranibizumab 0.5 mg intravitreal injections in 634 patients with DME. The trial’s primary endpoint was change in best-corrected visual acuity score from baseline at weeks 60 and 64.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Susvimo refilled every six months was found non-inferior in vision improvements compared to monthly ranibizumab intravitreal injections, at 9.6 eye chart letters vs. 9.4 letters, which investigators said equates to gaining two more lines on an eye chart.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Findings released in July 2024 show that patients maintained vision gain improvements at one year with 9.8 eye chart letters. Approximately 95% of patients did not require additional supplemental injections.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">4</sup></p><p class=\"pb-2\">The multicenter, randomized Pavilion trial enrolled patients with DR without center-involved DME. Patients in the Susvimo cohort received 100 mg/mL refilled every nine months to compare with individuals receiving monthly clinical observation. The trial’s primary endpoint was proportion of patients showing at least a two-step improvement from baseline on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study-Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale (DRSS) at week 52.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Two-year data found that at week 100, 80% of patients administered Susvimo achieved a two-step or higher improvement on the DRSS from pre-implant baseline. Those administered Susvimo at week 64 were found to maintain or improve their DRSS score from pre-implant baseline.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">“Susvimo presents a unique, convenient treatment alternative to routine eye injections for people with a potentially blinding diabetic eye condition,” Levi Garraway, MD, PhD, Roche chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development, said in a press release. “As the global prevalence of diabetic macular edema continues to grow, today's FDA approval for Susvimo reflects our dedication to innovation and enhancing the patient experience.”<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"pb-2\">1.

Hildebrand is a key member of Spencer Stuart’s global Board and CEO Practice and Leadership Advisory Services. He recently co-authored The Life Cycle of a CEO,<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup> the product of an unprecedented study of the performance patterns of every 21<sup class=\"text-inherit\">st</sup> century CEO of the S&amp;P 500 and more than 100 in-depth interviews revealing the distinctive stages of the life cycle of a CEO. In his client work, Hildebrand helps leaders uncover their edge and maximize performance.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Hildebrand’s work on the evolution of leadership is regularly cited in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and <em>Harvard Business Review</em>. He specializes in supporting senior executives to purposefully build long-term success, serving as confidant, coach, and adviser to many current and aspiring CEOs. He earned his PhD and MPhil in management from Columbia Business School.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"><strong>Q.</strong> “While layoffs slowed in the second half of 2024, biopharmas including Bayer, Bristol Myers Squibb, and Johnson &amp; Johnson cut hundreds or even thousands of employees over the course of the year.”<sup class=\"text-inherit\">2</sup> As CEOs strive to turnaround their fortunes in 2025, what are the realities and challenges that you might share with them given the research findings from your book, The Life Cycle of a CEO?</p><p class=\"pb-2\"><strong>A</strong><em>. </em><strong>Hildebrand</strong><em>: </em>We as humans think in cycles, such as the macro-economic cycles, industry cycles, and product cycles. But one cycle that we often overlook is the leadership cycle. Where is a leader on their own evolution and how can they unlock their full potential? In our studies, we analyzed the performance of over 2,000 CEOs from S&amp;P 500 companies over the 21st century and interviewed 100-plus leaders.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">What we discovered was a pattern of spikes and falls that leaders must navigate successfully. These findings can help not only incumbent CEOs, but also aspiring ones to anticipate the issues they are likely to face throughout their respective CEO journeys.</p><h1 class=\"text-3xl pb-4 pt-2\"><strong>CEO Life Cycle</strong></h1><ul class=\"my-2\"><li class=\"list-disc ml-8\"><strong>Launch</strong>: At this juncture, the CEOs are drinking from the firehose but also swept up in a powerful “honeymoon” tailwind of optimism and momentum as an incoming CEO, typically accompanied with the boost in share price.</li><li class=\"list-disc ml-8\"><strong>Calibration:</strong> Similar to the music industry, even breakout freshman CEOs often have their optimism checked during this phase where sometimes a sophomore slump occurs and expectations change. After two years, the honeymoon period is over as this executive is no longer the “new CEO, it is just CEO.”</li><li class=\"list-disc ml-8\"><strong>Reinvention:</strong> If the CEO is still in place after three to four years, this period often is characterized by the need for reinvention. Our research uncovered how it is often harder to reinvent in one’s own place. </li><li class=\"list-disc ml-8\"><strong>Complacency Trap</strong>: A period where performance may begin to stagnate, as many CEOs run the risk of becoming complacent, as well as boards which have become too trusting of the CEO and may not be fulfilling their fiduciary responsibilities to help support as well as challenge the CEO to achieve his or her aspirational key performance indicators.</li><li class=\"list-disc ml-8\"><strong>Legacy:</strong> For those CEOs who have survived the annual gauntlet of performance expectations, these fortunate leaders need to strategize about supporting their replacement for a smooth handover.</li></ul><p class=\"pb-2\">Given this analysis that was performed, my recommendations for incumbent and aspiring CEOs to consider include:<sup class=\"text-inherit\">3</sup></p><ul class=\"my-2\"><li class=\"list-disc ml-8\">Planting flags and building roads: As a leader, it is important to chart the course while also laying down the infrastructure for your team to follow.</li><li class=\"list-disc ml-8\">Giving up control to be in control: To lead effectively at scale, you must relinquish a degree of control. For many leaders, this concept tends to be an intellectual exercise rather than an emotional experience, primarily motivated by their need to preserve hierarchical control.</li><li class=\"list-disc ml-8\">Playing to win or avoiding to lose: There exist two motivational systems in us. We are either \"playing to win\" or \"avoiding to lose.\" It is vital to understand which message resonates with your team and how you can motivate them effectively.</li></ul><p class=\"pb-2\"><strong>Q.</strong> While several biopharma C-Suite leaders have shared their personal journeys via this HBS series<sup class=\"text-inherit\">4</sup> to readers who aspire to become CEOs, what advice would you recommend given your expertise around CEO performance at one of the top global leadership advisory firms?<sup class=\"text-inherit\">5</sup></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><strong>A.Hildebrand</strong>: First, don’t win the role, win the race. As I shared recently, the reality of a CEO’s tenure is actually a series of up-and-down stages—a life cycle, where the most successful executives learn to manage or even bend the performance curve in their favor.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">6</sup> Aspiring CEOs should take advantage of the years prior to build their leadership muscles through wide-ranging stretch moves that will often extend well beyond their comfort zone. These experiences will help to build the necessary skills and mindset needed to achieve long-term success – not just the title.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Second, one needs to identify blind spots, which are the weaknesses that we are not aware of and craft strategies to address them effectively and efficiently. Building upon findings from one of our research reports, what distinguished aspiring CEOs who beat the odds was their self-awareness and ability to continuously reinvent themselves.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">7</sup> Being self-aware and able to continuously improve is a crucial element to secure and thrive in a coveted CEO role.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Third, and perhaps most challenging, is when a leader needs to address the flat spots, which are one’s weaknesses you already are aware of, but for whatever reason are so challenging to address because of ego and a variety of other human aspects. But by being intellectually honest and having the humility to accept and work on one’s personal deficiencies, it is a differentiated mindset that can position a CEO for sustainable success. This mindset addresses the inevitable pain points which many CEOs will eventually face including:</p><ul class=\"my-2\"><li class=\"list-disc ml-8\">The false assumption that once I get the CEO role; everything will be fine.</li><li class=\"list-disc ml-8\">The inaccuracy to believe that once a M&amp;A deal is closed, the forecasted synergies will be realized with little friction.</li></ul><p class=\"pb-2\">The key takeaway from our extensive research is that b-school case studies often lionize protagonist CEOs for their big bold decisions and grand oration mobilizing others, but it is actually tenacity and the steady grind that wins the day.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">8</sup></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><strong>About the Author</strong></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><em>Michael Wong is a Part-time Lecturer for the Wharton Communication Program at the University of Pennsylvania.

The approval of our test for determining HER2-ultralow status offers new hope to patients by providing a possible path to HER2-targeted treatment where none existed before, helping clinicians transform outcomes for many facing this challenging disease.”<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup></p><p class=\"pb-2\">The expanded label for the PATHWAY anti-HER2 (4B5) test now includes the identification of patients designated as \"HER2-ultralow,” which is individuals with extremely low HER2 expression levels that are lower than the current HER2-low category. Prior to HER2-low status being introduced in 2022, HER2 status was defined as being either positive or negative based HER2 expression levels.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup></p><p class=\"pb-2\">The PATHWAY anti-HER2/neu test is utilized in combination with the BenchMark IHC/ISH slide staining instrument. This process standardizes immunohistochemistry practices to lower the possibility of human error and variability. According to Roche, the system produces consistently high proficiency scores that are concordant with HER2 FISH. The test was used as part of the DESTINY-Breast06 Phase III trial, which was the basis of the approval for Enhertu.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">DESTINY-Breast06 was a global, randomized, open-label trial that analyzed the efficacy and safety of Enhertu vs. investigator’s choice of chemotherapy with capecitabine, paclitaxel, or nab-paclitaxel. A total of 866 patients were enrolled across Asia, Europe, Australia, North America, and South America.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">The trial’s primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) as measured by blinded independent central review (BICR), with secondary endpoints that included PFS as per BICR in the overall trial population, overall survival (OS) in the HER2-low patient population, and OS in the overall trial population.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Trial data show that Enhertu lowered the risk of disease progression or death by 36% with a median PFS of 13.2 months vs. 8.1 months in patients administered chemotherapy. Results also showed an objective response rate of 62.2%.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">“Endocrine therapy is typically used in the initial treatment of HR-positive metastatic breast cancer and following progression, subsequent chemotherapy is associated with poor outcomes. With a median progression-free survival exceeding one year and a response rate of more than 60%, trastuzumab deruxtecan offers a potential new standard of care for patients with HR-positive, HER2-low or HER2-ultralow metastatic breast cancer following endocrine therapy,” trial investigator Aditya Bardia, MD, MPH, program director, breast oncology, director, translational research integration, UCLA Health Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, said in a press release.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">2</sup></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"pb-2\">1.

Reuters reported that Trump plans to place tariffs on various items including computer chips and pharmaceuticals.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup></p><p class=\"pb-2\">The President has argued that his tariffs would have a variety of positive impacts on the United States, such as pushing more companies to produce goods within the country. However, critics of the President say that these tariffs will increase costs for American consumers and even potentially cause disruptions in the availability of goods. For the pharmaceutical industry, this could have far-reaching implications.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">In a press release, president and CEO of the Association for Accessible Medicines John Murphy III said, “The global supply chain for generic and biosimilar medicines is critically important for U.S. patients.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">2</sup> From the base ingredients to the finished products, U.S. medicines rely on a global supply chain that is already stressed and in need of strengthening. Tariffs on products from Canada, Mexico, and China could increase already problematic drug shortages.”</p><p class=\"pb-2\">He continued to discuss the impact the tariffs could have on generic manufacturers, who often operate at lower margins. According to Murphy, the generics market in the US has grown in volume and launches, but sales have actually decreased by $6.4 billion in the past five years. As a result, these manufacturers could struggle to absorb new costs and may be forced to exit markets where they are already struggling.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">“Americans pay less for generics than almost anywhere in the world but are facing growing challenges of drug shortages,” he continued. “The previous Trump Administration opted not to impose tariffs on generic and biosimilar manufactures. AAM and its members urge the Administration to follow their past practice and work with our industry on constructive policies and regulatory reforms that will bolster the resiliency and vibrancy of this critical healthcare market to the benefit of the American economy, lower overall healthcare costs, and keeping America’s patients healthy.”</p><p class=\"pb-2\">The Healthcare Distribution Alliance (HDA) also issued a statement, saying that it believes that strategic investments in domestic manufacturing would result in positive change for the healthcare industry.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">3</sup> However, it also believes that the proposed tariffs would result in creating more challenges than solutions.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">“We respectfully urge caution on instituting tariffs on sectors that will impact medical products,” the HDA said in its statement. “Tariffs on pharmaceuticals would strain the pharmaceutical supply chain and could adversely affect American patients, whether through increased medical product costs or manufacturers leaving the market. Accordingly, we ask the administration to consider establishing exemptions for pharmaceutical products and long implementation timelines to maintain the safe and efficient delivery of approximately 10 million medicines and healthcare products every day.”</p><p class=\"pb-2\">The statement continued, “We are concerned that placing tariffs on generic drug products produced outside the U.S. will put additional pressure on an industry that is already experiencing financial distress. Distributors and generic manufacturers and cannot absorb the rising costs of broad tariffs. It is worth noting that distributors operate on low profit margins - 0.3 percent. As a result, the U.S. will likely see new and worsened shortages of important medications and the costs will be passed down to payers and patients, including those in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.”</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Aside from direct tariffs on pharmaceuticals, tariffs on computer chips and other technologies could strain the industry’s relationship with AI. Some of the proposed tariffs could also significantly impact power prices, which is already a significant cost for AI procedures.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">President Trump has laid out multiple targets for tariffs and has stated a variety of reasons for why he’s implementing these tariffs. At this stage, it’s still unclear what impact these tariffs will have and how the various industries involved will react. The only thing that’s clear is that this issue will likely impact major decisions across the pharma industry for the foreseeable future.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><p class=\"pb-2\"></p><h2 class=\"text-2xl pb-4 pt-2\">Sources</h2><ol class=\"my-2\"><li class=\"list-decimal ml-8\">Trump Tariffs on Chips and Drugs Would Hit U.S. Allies in Asia. <em>Reuters</em>.

            "title": "The Future of EDETEK's R&D Cloud",
            "description": "<div class=\"blockText_blockContent__TbCXh\"><div class=\"relative\"><div autoplay=\"\" class=\"brightcove-fluid\"></div></div><p class=\"pb-2\">In this Pharmaceutical Executive video interview, Dr. Shakthi Kumar, Chief Strategy and Business Officer, EDETEK, Inc. further explores <a href=\"https://www.pharmexec.com/view/edetek-unveils-rdcloud-for-clinical-development\" target=\"_blank\">the company's launch of R&amp;D Cloud</a>, emphasizing the platform's open API access, extensive library of pre-built connectors for various data sources, and real-time data and workflow capabilities. </p><p class=\"pb-2\">He highlights key differentiators including the breadth and depth of integrated capabilities (covering the entire clinical trial lifecycle), robust workflow and event management, multi-SSO integration, and a state-of-the-art cloud architecture.<sup class=\"text-inherit\"> </sup></p><p class=\"pb-2\">Future development plans include incorporating AI, expanding connectors, and specializing in additional therapeutic areas. Ultimately, the R&amp;D Cloud aims to provide cost reduction, improved business outcomes (faster trials, real-time insights), and enhanced data quality and compliance for clients.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">A transcription of the conversation is available below.</p><h2 class=\"text-2xl pb-4 pt-2\">Are there future development plans for the R&amp;D Cloud ecosystem?</h2><p class=\"pb-2\">We have very ambitious development plans for the R&amp;D Cloud ecosystem. We continue to invest in a number of areas, and you know, I can probably highlight a few. We are incorporating advanced, of course, artificial intelligence capabilities within the RNA cloud, specifically agentic AI and machine learning technologies to drive better insights and decision making for our clients. So that's something that's ongoing.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">The second one is we are expanding the list of upstream and downstream connectors. This is to make it easy to integrate our R&amp;D Cloud, with other third-party software, and we expect to continue to partner with others. For us partnership is a key tenet of what we want to do, so we will continue to do that. And we will double down and specialize in other therapeutic areas as well. I talked about on cop loss, but next in the line, we're working on CNS and that immunology. So, I think we do believe that that provides, you know, significant benefits to the industry, you know, getting much needed therapies faster to patients. And so those are some of the areas we're looking at right now.</p><h2 class=\"text-2xl pb-4 pt-2\">How does the R&amp;D Cloud translate into tangible benefits for EDETEK's clients?</h2><p class=\"pb-2\">Tangibility comes in three different ways. The first one is the best metric for tangibility is cost reduction, so they can incrementally layer our R&amp;D Cloud offering in. To existing operational environments where there are gaps to really build an ecosystem. So, there is no need to replace an expensive, lift and shift of their existing environments, as well as costly integrations, because our on the cloud already comes prebuilt with over 80 different integrations with major software, so cost reduction is one.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">The second one is in terms of business outcomes. We do believe it has significantly helped our clients to improve the speed and efficiency of clinical trial execution. Miranda, just to give you an overview today, our platform is used by over 100 Life Sciences organizations. We have our conform platform. And eClinical platforms have managed over 3 billion data points, including many, many mega trials. In terms of business outcomes, we're very confident in driving faster study start up, as well as real time data insights and accelerated regulatory submissions, right? So that's kind of driving business outcomes. Is a key benefit to our clients.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">The third one is improved data quality and compliance. The platform, we have robust, you know, validation rules, we have alerts as well as a whole library of checks that we perform on the data that's ingested into the R&amp;D Cloud, which means that the data quality improves, as well as compliance to various regulatory standards, right? Those are kind of three tangible benefits, as I mentioned earlier, we are really excited for our clients that the dream of build your own R&amp;D Cloud is actually becoming a reality, and we here to support it.</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"blockText_blockContent__TbCXh\"><p class=\"pb-2\"><strong></strong></p><div class=\"relative\"><div autoplay=\"\" class=\"brightcove-fluid\"></div></div><p class=\"pb-2\"><strong>PE: The phase Ib trial demonstrated improvements in histology, symptoms, biomarkers, and nutrient absorption. Which of these findings do you consider most critical for advancing IMU-856 to later-stage trials?</strong></p><p class=\"pb-2\"><strong>Vitt: </strong>IMU-856 is quite unique for GI indications, including celiac disease because it is not immunosuppressive, but it’s able to establish the proper epithelial layer in the gut wall. Therefore, the histologic protection, which even achieves statistical significance by the very small number of patients involved here. The key endpoint is protecting the gut from histologic distraction. It’s also important for the development. </p><p class=\"pb-2\">The second important endpoint is the functional improvement. I think this is something new and so far, not seen with other drugs or concepts, because if you restore the proper layer of cells there, then you also have more viable cells.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">These cells are actively transporting nutrients from the gut wall into the body. For example, one of the functional endpoints was vitamin B12 uptake. We could see that in the patients during the four weeks of treatment that despite receiving gluten and the gluten challenge, there was an improvement in the dose dependent fashion, which we think speaks for the speed and the quality of an onset of action for the driver.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"><strong>Full Interview Summary: </strong>The Phase Ib trial of IMU-856 demonstrated improvements across multiple endpoints, including histology, symptoms, biomarkers, and nutrient absorption. Among these, the most critical finding for advancing the drug to later-stage trials is its ability to restore the gut’s epithelial layer without immunosuppression. The drug achieved statistically significant histologic protection, even with a small patient sample, indicating its potential to preserve gut integrity. Additionally, functional improvements, such as increased vitamin B12 uptake despite gluten exposure, highlight its unique mode of action and rapid onset of efficacy.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">IMU-856 offers a promising solution for celiac disease patients, particularly those at risk of symptom flare-ups due to cross-contamination with small amounts of gluten. By strengthening the gut barrier, the drug could benefit patients with active and severe disease, who often struggle with inadvertent gluten exposure.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Regarding safety and tolerability, the trial found IMU-856 to be well tolerated with no dose-dependent adverse events or maximum tolerated dose concerns. Chronic toxicology studies have also confirmed its potential for long-term use across various gastrointestinal disorders. The favorable safety profile allows for flexible dosing strategies, with the 160 mg dose already showing strong efficacy. Future studies may explore slight adjustments in dosage to optimize treatment.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Immunic is positioning itself as a leader in gastrointestinal therapeutics, with celiac disease as the lead indication for IMU-856. However, the drug’s potential extends to conditions like Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and graft-versus-host disease. It could serve as a combination therapy alongside immunosuppressants in these conditions. With ongoing Phase III programs in neuroinflammation and multiple sclerosis, the company aims to establish itself at the forefront of both gastrointestinal and neuroinflammatory diseases. Collaborations and strategic partnerships will likely play a key role in expanding the drug’s applications.</p></div>",

According to the company, Symbravo employs Axsome’s MoSEIC rapid absorption technology to enhance meloxicam’s bioavailability while combining it with rizatriptan. Data from the Phase III MOMENTUM, INTERCEPT, and MOVEMENT trials showed Symbravo produced statistically significant pain freedom and symptom relief at two hours post-dose, with sustained benefits compared to placebo and rizatriptan alone.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup></p><p class=\"pb-2\">“A significant proportion of migraine patients experience inadequate efficacy with currently available acute treatments, leading to even greater suffering, and an increased risk of worsening of migraine pain and attack frequency. Results of multiple clinical trials demonstrate that Symbravo can provide rapid and long-lasting freedom from migraine pain, whether treatment is taken early in the attack while the pain is mild, or later in the attack when the pain may be severe. The approval of Symbravo is a long awaited and much welcomed advancement for clinicians and our patients, providing a new, meaningful treatment option,” said Richard B. Lipton, MD, professor of neurology, director, Montefiore Headache Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, in a press release.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Results from the MOMENTUM trial found that found that Symbravo demonstrated statistically significant efficacy over placebo. Additionally, 77% of patients didn’t require rescue medication within 24 hours post dose. A head-to-head comparison with rizatriptan further highlighted Symbravo’s superiority in sustained pain freedom from two to 24 hours, with benefits observed after a single dose.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">Data from the INTERCEPT trial demonstrated results similar to those of the MOMENTUM trial in patients experiencing photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea two hours after dosing. Eighty-five percent of patients in the trial did not require rescue medication within 24 hours post dose.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">The long-term open label MOVEMENT safety trial consisted of 706 patients to determine the long-term safety of Symbravo. Common adverse events included somnolence and dizziness.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">1</sup></p><p class=\"pb-2\">According to a study published in the <em>JAMA Network, </em>approximately 10% of the global population can experience migraines. Additionally, migraines are most prevalent in people between 20 and 50 years of age. Further, it is three times more common in women than in men.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">2</sup> According to the World Health Organization (WHO), children usually experience shorter migraines than adults, although abdominal symptoms are more common.</p><p class=\"pb-2\">WHO estimates that headache disorders as a whole affect approximately 40% of the global population. Additionally, headaches are the third highest cause of disability-adjusted life years globally, behind only stroke and dementia. It is among the three most common neurological conditions in most age groups between five and 80 years of age. Other common forms of headache include tension-type headache, cluster headache, and medication-overuse headache.<sup class=\"text-inherit\">3</sup></p><p class=\"pb-2\">“Today’s approval of Symbravo marks an important milestone for the migraine community by providing a rationally designed novel acute treatment for this debilitating condition. Migraine attacks strike without warning and disrupt the lives of estimated more than 39 million patients in the US alone. Symbravo provides patients and clinicians an important new option which can quickly stop a migraine attack, keep it away, and allow patients to resume their normal activities, with just a single dose. Symbravo demonstrates Axsome’s commitment to developing and delivering differentiated new treatments to improve the lives of patients living with difficult to treat central nervous system disorders,” said Herriot Tabuteau, MD, CEO, Axsome Therapeutics, in the press release.</p><p class=\"pb-2\"><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"pb-2\">1.
