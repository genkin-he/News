            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Bill Peters </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     'The consumer is not positioned to pay more for discretionary goods given pressures elsewhere in their budgets,' BofA analysts say </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Lots of clothes on store shelves could get a bit more expensive if new tariffs announced by President Donald Trump over the weekend eventually take hold. But after three years of price increases and higher costs of living, some Wall Street analysts say shoppers might be too worn out to buy any of it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"We don't expect apparel retailers to be successful in passing through costs to consumers; the consumer is not positioned to pay more for discretionary goods given pressures elsewhere in their budgets,\" BofA analysts said in a research note on Monday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Still, the BofA analysts said, the new tariffs' impact on specialty retailers and department stores would pressure profit margins \"only modestly as imports from those countries are limited.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Trump over the weekend said the U.S. would impose a 25% additional tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada - although energy from Canada will be taxed at 10% - with a 10% additional tariff on imports from China. Mexico and Canada on Monday worked out agreements to keep the tariffs from going into effect for another month. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Economists have said any new tariffs risked pushing prices higher, as the businesses importing products pass the extra costs of those duties onto shoppers. How much prices might rise while the tariffs are in place isn't exactly clear. Different companies might absorb those extra costs more than others. But some analysts have said retailers, which often run on narrow margins, have little choice but to pass the costs onto shoppers via price increases. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Teen-centric discount retailer Five Below (FIVE), the analysts at BofA said, was among the chains that imported a lot of things from China. Footwear maker Skechers USA (SKX), they said, was another. Western-wear chain Boot Barn (BOOT), the analysts said, got 30% of its items from China and 25% from Mexico. Most of the goods sourced by department-store chain Kohl's Corp. (KSS), were made outside the U.S., and largely in Asia. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Elsewhere, analysts at UBS on Monday noted that shoe maker Steve Madden (SHOO) relied heavily on China for products, even as the company tries to shift production elsewhere. Winter-jacket maker Canada Goose (GOOS), they said, relied solely on Canada. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The UBS analysts also said that the cost of goods sold - or the cost to make and sell things - could rise 9% for Boot Barn and 25% for Canada Goose due to the tariffs. However, they said that the average \"softline\" company they followed - those being businesses that make and sell things like clothing and linens - would only see a 1.6% increase in cost of goods sold because of the new tariffs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The BofA analysts on Monday said that the full impact from the new tariffs, if they happen, might not emerge until several months from now. The topic is likely to be a big one on earnings calls in the weeks ahead, they said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     However, they said that a \"universal\" tariff - Trump has proposed a tariff of at least 10% on all imports - would chew more deeply into retailers' gross margins. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"In a universal tariff scenario, we estimate that a company selling products with an average unit cost (AUC) of $10 and retail price of $75 would have to raise prices by almost $2 (3%) to offset the incremental [gross margin] headwind,\" they said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     But as markets and retailers digest the current trade friction, both BofA and UBS said shares of off-price chains could be safer bets. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"We view off-price retailers as relatively insulated from tariff risk as they primarily source domestically,\" BofA said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The UBS analysts said: \"In the short term, rising uncertainty probably isn't good for stocks.\" Thus, they said, investors could shift their money toward names like TJX Cos. (TJX), which owns TJ Maxx, and Burlington Stores Inc. (BURL). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"Furthermore, tariffs likely create meaningful supply-chain dislocation,\" the UBS analysts said. \"This is another reason to buy off-price stocks since these companies typically outperform in times of dislocation.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The White House, in its announcement on Saturday, cited the \"extraordinary threat posed by illegal aliens and drugs, including deadly fentanyl\" as the reason for the tariffs set to start this week. The additional levies, it said, were intended to ensure the three nations addressed those issues. More broadly, the Trump camp has said tariffs would help revive U.S. jobs and manufacturing, or function as a tool to extract trade deals and other concessions that favor the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     But clothing makers, after relying on low-paying labor to pad profits, likely wouldn't want to pay the extra money to shift production back to the U.S., the BofA analysts said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"Moving manufacturing to the U.S. is not feasible because it requires large capital investment and there is a significant differential in labor costs: Apparel is labor intensive and the minimum wage in Vietnam is only $150-$200 a month,\" they said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Bill Peters </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Kimberley Kao </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Markets across Asia staged a relief rally after U.S. President Trump agreed to postpone the start of tariffs on Mexico and Canada by a month, suggesting that a reversal is possible. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was recently 1.1% higher on Tuesday, led by gains in auto and electronic stocks. Hong Kong's benchmark index rose 2.0% and South Korea's Kospi gained 1.5%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The rebound came after the U.S. struck last-minute deals with Mexico and Canada to delay new tariffs, after separate calls with the leaders of both nations. China, another tariff target, is also preparing to talk trade with Trump. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Trump's aggressive move to place tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in imports rattled investors, economists and some lawmakers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  In a social media post, Trump said that his administration will see in the next 30 days if an \"economic deal\" with Canada can be structured. He made similar comments about Mexico earlier Monday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  \"A headlines-driven market seems synonymous with Trump 2.0, much like in 2016,\" Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG, said in a note. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The extended timeline for Mexico and Canada can provide immediate relief for risk sentiment, Yeap said. \"More importantly, it underscores President Trump's willingness to negotiate, potentially with tariff moves as bargaining chips rather than firm policy decisions.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Oliver Blackbourn, multiasset portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said that the quick reappraisal on tariffs suggests that there might be a way out. It \"gave markets hope that this could be a short-lived episode, although perhaps this is only the case with Mexico and Canada,\" he said in a commentary. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Other Asian stock markets were broadly higher. Taiwan's Taiex index gained 0.7% and Malaysia's benchmark Kuala Lumpur Composite Index rose 0.5%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Currency markets, which have whipsawed during the barrage of tariff news, breathed a small sigh of relief over the delays. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The yen weakened against most other G-10 and Asian currencies as sentiment toward risk assets rebounded. The Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso clawed back ground lost after the initial jolt. Asian currencies broadly rose against the U.S. dollar. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The offshore yuan strengthened in a possible reflection of expectations that China too will get a tariff reprieve, Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho Securities' head of macro research for Asia, excluding Japan, said in a note. But the \"overarching geo-economic dimensions to U.S.-China trade means that resolution will be far more fraught than is the case with Mexico and Canada,\" he cautioned. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Relief isn't resolution, as Trump has warned that tariff plans are intact, Varathan said. U.S.-driven trade antagonism threats remain at large, and \"it promises to be a bumpy ride for markets in the weeks ahead,\" with currency markets set up to be the most sensitive to U.S. tariff threats, he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The euro, Korean won, Thai baht, Malaysian ringgit, Australian dollar and offshore yuan remain on the line, Varathan said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Until recently, many on Wall Street viewed threats of the U.S. imposing the highest tariffs in decades as a negotiating tactic in border disputes over drug trafficking and migration and unlikely to materialize. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  \"We still think that permanent tariffs on the U.S.'s allies (Canada, Mexico) will not be a thing,\" said Thierry Wizman, global foreign-exchange and rates strategist at Macquarie. \"Tariffs [are] likely to be reversed before they do serious damage.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  \"That's because concessions are an 'easier' way to deal with Trump's 'problems'...and Trump likes to make 'deals,'\" Wizman said in a note. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  --Fabiana Negrin Ochoa, Ronnie Harui and Farah Elias contributed to this article. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Write to Kimberley Kao at kimberley.kao@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  February 03, 2025 23:20 ET (04:20 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Therese Poletti </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Apple Inc. was one of the luckier consumer-electronics companies when it got exemptions from the tariffs imposed by the first Trump administration on many goods made in China. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     But this time, it might not be quite as fortunate. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The additional 10% tariffs on goods made in China being imposed by the Trump administration this time around are, for now, expected to include the iPhone - and it's reasonable to assume Apple (AAPL) will pass this added cost on to their customers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Last week, during Apple's earnings call, Chief Executive Tim Cook declined to comment on the subject of tariffs on Chinese-made goods. That was an indication that the company did not yet have any kind of exemption from the much-anticipated tariffs, as Wall Street has been hoping for. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Read: Trump agrees to delay tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Next up is talks with China. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     So far, the 10% tariff is much less than previously expected, but it could incite Apple to move more of its manufacturing outside of China. During the last trade war enacted by Trump, many tech companies began to explore moving - and many eventually did move - some manufacturing from China to other countries in Asia. Apple still makes the bulk of its iPhones in China. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     On the earnings call, Cook told investors he was keen on India as an emerging market for its products. In recent years, Apple has also shifted a little over 10% of iPhone manufacturing to three major contractors in India, including Foxconn, according to India's Business Standard. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan isn't so sure Apple will increase its prices, and believes the company can move most of its iPhone manufacturing to India. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"Apple could have its manufacturing partners ramp up production in India and ship to the U.S.,\" Mohan told clients Monday. \"This could also be done for other Apple products that are manufactured in countries including Vietnam, Malaysia, etc. We have assumed 80% of Apple products sold in the U.S. can be sourced from other countries, apart from China.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     He said if 50% of Apple's devices are still sourced in China, the EPS impact would be 12 cents per share if Apple does not raise prices, and 7 cents per share if it raises them. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     For now, though, Mohan left his estimates on Apple unchanged. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     But the industry group that produces CES in Las Vegas believes the tariffs are bad for the industry and will certainly lead to price hikes, even though the tariffs are lower than it previously projected. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"Tariffs are taxes on American consumers, not foreign governments or companies. Increasing tariffs on imports from Canada, China and Mexico will fuel inflation and raise prices on tech products, automotive manufacturing, and services,\" said Gary Shapiro, the president of the Consumer Technology Association, in a statement Monday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     If Apple raises prices on the iPhone and possibly other products, it won't be alone. In the last trade war, which began in 2018 when Trump enacted tariffs against China, some tech companies imposed price hikes due to their own rising costs that they partially or fully passed on to consumers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The 10% tariffs Trump announced over the weekend on China were much lower than the 60% tariffs analysts and policy watchers had been expecting. In addition, the president included 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico - but on Monday afternoon put those on pause for a month. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     If the U.S. tariffs on Mexican-made goods end up going through, other consumer-electronics products could see price hikes as well. In the PC sector, HP Inc. (HPQ) and Dell Technologies Inc. (DELL) are among those with some manufacturing or assembly operations in Mexico. (Neither company responded to requests for comment.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Intel Corp. (INTC), though, said on its earnings call last week that it believed part of its slightly better-than-expected revenue was due to its customers buying ahead of tariffs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"I expect the tariffs to definitely impact the tech sector,\" said Dan Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company. \"I just expect the impact will not be as devastating as the Street is anticipating.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Even so, the latest tariffs appear to be political volleys. The new administration and its flurry of changes has created chaos; some of the measures have been reversed, while others are already facing litigation. But the tariffs against China are likely to stand, as Trump is keen on trying to maintain a competitive advantage in technology. Apple might end up having to raise prices and shift more of its manufacturing out of China - but it won't be alone among tech giants. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Therese Poletti </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

State Farm received a prior <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">$471 million</span>, 20% rate increase, that took effect in March of 2024.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Under Proposition 103, insurance companies must open their books and justify rate requests before they can take effect. State Farm's request in June has been stalled by the company's refusal to disclose data on its finances, including apparent overpayments for reinsurance State Farm buys from its parent company. The parent company has more than <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">$130 billion</span> in surplus. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\"If State Farm needs money the parent company should step in with its <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">$130 billion</span> surplus, not <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">California</span> homeowners some of whose homes are in ashes,\" said <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Carmen Balber</span>, executive director of Consumer Watchdog.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Consumer Watchdog, which asked the commissioner to hold a hearing on the June rate increase application, wrote State Farm's lawyer 14 times <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">between September 13 and January 21</span> trying to obtain a response to its requests for information.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Now State Farm is asking the Commissioner to immediately approve a 22% increase on an \"interim\" basis - without having to prove that it needs that increase first.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Absent access to the needed data, Consumer Watchdog's preliminary calculations show that State Farm would have to pay out roughly <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">$9 billion</span> to justify a 22% increase.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Today Consumer Watchdog once again asked State Farm to provide information that would back up its demand. State Farm has said that it will provide data to the Department and Consumer Watchdog within a couple days, but will press forward with asking the Commissioner to approve a 22% interim rate hike regardless of whether the Department and Consumer Watchdog's actuaries agree that the data supports it.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\"State Farm is required to prove its claims of poverty and financial disaster; it has refused to do so since last September. Now it's trying to cash in on a terrible tragedy by detouring the rules that protect state consumers from insurance price gouging – at a time when those safeguards are more important than ever,\" said Balber. \"Insurance Commissioner Lara must require State Farm to prove it needs this staggering increase.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">State Farm's letter promises the Commissioner that it will make refunds to policyholders if it later turns out that the immediate increase is unwarranted. But State Farm won a court ruling in 2021 that said the commissioner has no power to order State Farm to make refunds.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Facts About State Farm</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">State Farm General is the <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">California</span> affiliate of State Farm, the nation's largest home, auto and business insurance company. The parent company has a <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">$134 billion</span> surplus. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">State Farm General had direct underwriting profits from homeowners insurance of <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">$1.4 billion</span> between 2020 and 2023. It buys its reinsurance coverage primarily from the parent company and gets little in return. From 2014 to 2023 State Farm paid reinsurance premiums of nearly <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">$2.2 billion</span>, but was only reimbursed <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">$0.4 billion</span> – or less than 20%. A reinsurance return that low is a strong indication that the company is overpaying.
