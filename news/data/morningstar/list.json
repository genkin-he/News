I'm in my 50s and concerned about interest rates, tariffs, inflation and the general performance of the economy and markets. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     I've been in the nonprofit world my entire career, so my 403(b) is less than $500,000. I contribute 14% to my retirement and my employer matches 6%.  I check my account every three months or so, or more, and I'm not always happy with what I see. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     My husband has a solid job with decent retirement. We have sensible car payments, our home is about half paid off and we have no other debt. Second jobs are not an option, as we both work a huge number of unpredictable hours. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     I'm worried there won't be time to regrow after any tank in the markets, especially after the Federal Reserve's latest statement, which I am still trying to make sense of. How do I shield my retirement savings from the current economic forecast? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Fiftysomething Worker </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Related: 'My retirement is going to be a disaster': I'm 59 and have $45,000 in my 401(k). I earn $72,000. Am I doomed? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Dear Fiftysomething, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Fourteen years is a long time in politics and the stock market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     For every registered Democratic voter there is another registered Republican who feels great optimism about the next four years. While never the twain shall meet, it illustrates the importance of perspective and perils of subjectivity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     More importantly for you, 14 years is a long time before you retire. A lot will happen between now and then, but your 14% contribution to your 403(b) and 6% match will stand to you over the next decade and a half. As you pass 50, start allocating more to bonds than stocks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     You're writing at a dramatic time for U.S. stocks. China's DeepSeek's apparent ability to produce AI capabilities at a fraction of the cost of U.S. companies rattled Silicon Valley. And now the U.S. faces a trade war, which risks hurting demand for goods and, therefore, growth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Focus on what you can control: Your job, your 403(b) contributions and employer match, your modest car payments and paying off any credit-card debt you may incur every month, and slowly - but surely - paying off your mortgage. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     So, if in 14 years, you have $800,000 or $1 million in your retirement account rather than $500,000, it will be a bonus to the modest lifestyle that has gotten you where you want to be so you can move to a lighter work schedule or, indeed, not work at all. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Stay the course and don't catastrophize. Focus on your job, your 403(b) contributions and employer match, and staying free of credit-card debt. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     But nor do I want to gaslight you with platitudes. Tariffs - and, in particular, a trade war - can have severe implications for the price of goods, consumer demand and, as a result, economic growth. They can lead businesses to cut investment and, as you say, dampen economic growth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     On Monday, President Trump agreed to pause his tariffs on Mexico and Canada. The tariffs, which originally went into effect on Feb. 1, included levies of 25% on imports from Canada, 10% on energy products from Canada, and a10% tariff on imports from China. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Markets are - for the most part - hoping that Trump is using such threats as a negotiating ploy with two of the U.S.'s closest neighbors, and China. Trump said he's speaking with Canadian and Mexican leaders on Tuesday. These countries are, after all, the top three purchasers of U.S. goods. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Writing on the social-media site Truth Social on Sunday, Trump acknowledged that tariffs could result in \"some pain,\" but said it is the \"price that must be paid.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, S&amp;P 500 SPX and Nasdaq COMP all ended lower on Monday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     He may not be wrong. This peer-reviewed study by a group of international economists, looking at 151 countries between 1963-2014, found that tariff increases are associated with \"an economically and statistically sizable and persistent decline in output growth.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Markets are - for the most part - hoping that Trump is using tariff threats as a negotiating ploy with Mexico and Canada, two of the U.S.'s closest neighbors, and China. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Fed officials are not playwrights. In fact, they are often trying to avoid giving us a clear message we can take home and parse apart over the coming weeks and months. In times of change, it often behooves them to be less committal, as understandably frustrating as that is for you. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Economists and the Federal Reserve are trying, perhaps in vain, to predict the impact of tariffs, looser financial regulation and tougher immigration policies on the economy and consumers. Stay the course and don't catastrophize. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Last week, the Fed left the benchmark interest rate unchanged after three consecutive rate reductions in 2024, which reduced rates by one percentage point. As for making major changes: If in doubt, leave them out. We can all benefit from that logic. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     In January's press conference, as a recent example, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell used the word \"uncertainty,\" or a variation of that word, more than a dozen times. Without uncertainty, there is no future. It's a package deal, I'm afraid. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Fed statements can tend to be frustratingly vague and repetitive, which might give you some reassurance in that as much as everything changes, things also stay the same. Fed officials don't always see crises coming, even when they've technically already arrived. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Not everyone will be impacted in the same way by world events. The U.S. is a kaleidoscope of consumers who have different levels of vulnerability and job security. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The Fed, in its most recent statement, said, \"The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     OK, good luck interpreting that in a way that gives you the answer that you need. In the meantime, know that the stock market (and your retirement) will likely continue to rise over the long term. If you are freaking out over three-month returns, you will have a rough 14 years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a nonprofit research organization, in a recent note, said that inflation will take roughly two years to return to the Fed's 2% target rate. \"Economic forecasts even one year or two years out are highly uncertain,\" it said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     But it struck an upbeat tone. \"Broadly speaking, the data indicate that the U.S. economy in the later part of 2024 was in a strong position,\" it added. What's more, it said that \"employment levels were at near-historic highs, and real wage and income growth was positive.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"The incoming Trump administration is taking the helm of a U.S. economy largely on solid footing,\" it concluded. \"The evolution of the U.S. economy over the next several years, therefore, should be measured against this extraordinary starting point.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Fed statements can be frustratingly vague and repetitive, which might give you some reassurance: as much as everything changes, they stay the same. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Former President Joe Biden has left a pretty solid economy for Trump by most measures: Inflation has finally cooled, for now, with the consumer-price index currently running below 3%. Unemployment reached 4.1% in December. For now, the markets will focus on the tariff turmoil. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Gross domestic product growth in the second quarter outperformed many economists' more pessimistic expectations due to persistently high interest rates and worries about the cost of living on everything from eggs to property. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Not everyone will be impacted in the same way by world events. The U.S. is a kaleidoscope of consumers who have different levels of vulnerability and job security. Debt is one area where you are strong. Keeping debts low is the best way to navigate uncertainty. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Your retirement savings are in good shape, for the most part. The average 401(k) balance for someone aged 50 to 54 is $201,400 and $246,800 for those aged 55 to 59, according to Fidelity, so assume that the median balance is even lower than that. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     If Jerome Powell is not able to accurately predict the direction of the U.S. economy over the next six months, one year or even four years, how are you supposed to know any better? Take statements from those who do say they know with at least a pinch of salt. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Related: Will Trump's policies lead to a recession?

For now, the first rate cut is being priced in for June - [at] the earliest,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The Federal Reserve is expected to take its Fed funds rate target down to around 3.925% by December, according to 30-day Fed Funds futures, suggesting just two 25 basis point cuts this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Other U.S. economic data due Tuesday include factory orders for December, released at 10:00 a.m. Eastern. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Federal Reserve officials making comments include: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -- 11:00 a.m. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks on housing. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -- 2:00 p.m. San Francisco Fed President Daly speaks on the economic outlook. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -- 7:30 p.m. Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Philip Jefferson speaks on the economy and monetary policy. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Jamie Chisholm </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

(Euronext Growth Paris: ALVIO) today announced a strategic decision to discontinue all clinical trials and associated activities, including the ongoing VIO-01 trial. This shift was decided by the board of directors in the context of the financing challenges of the Company. The Company’s cash position should enable it to finance its refocused business other the next three months. In the meantime, in addition to the reduction of its expenses, it is negotiating with its stakeholders and is seeking to reach the agreement needed to secure its financial and cash trajectory in the next twelve months.\n<br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/>The end of clinical trials will enable the company to focus exclusively on early-stage drug development, ensuring efficient use of available capital while maintaining a strong focus on innovation.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nAs part of this transition, Valerio will cease clinical-stage operations in oncology and close its U.S. office in Lexington, MA. The company is conducting a strategic review to redefine its pipeline and long-term vision, ensuring sustainable growth and value creation for stakeholders. The Company will focus on its early-stage activities, namely the development of its single chain antibody platform, which, coupled with chemistry capabilities and oligonucleotides expertise, can open new avenues for the company.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nThe company will update the market as soon as the ongoing discussions with its stakeholders lead to securing a long-term financing solution to achieve its strategic development milestones.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\"><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">Julien Miara, Chairperson and CEO of Valerio Therapeutics, commented:\n<br data-v-370fea16=\"\"/></em></strong><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">“This decision, which will help consolidate the financial position of the company together with other actions, allows us to focus on our core strengths in early-stage research while preserving financial flexibility to drive transformative innovation.
