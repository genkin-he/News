Jenkins, Jr., executive vice president and chief development officer, UNCF. “Her commitment not only showcases her dedication to education and athletics but also inspires the next generation of student-athletes to pursue their dreams. This gift reinforces the importance of supporting our young leaders and ensuring they have the resources necessary to succeed both on and off the court.\"</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">The Coco Gauff Scholarship Program will be administered by UNCF and scholarships will be awarded to eligible students who play competitive tennis starting in May.

Several members of Gauff’s family have attended or currently attend HBCUs.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\"My family has a deep-rooted history with HBCUs, going all the way back to my great, great grandfather. From aunts and uncles to cousins, HBCUs have played a huge role in shaping who we are. Supporting UNCF in creating opportunities for student-athletes in tennis means a lot to me. As a young Black athlete, I understand how impactful it is to see people who look like me thriving in both sports and education. I want to help the next generation of student-athletes continue pursuing their passion for tennis while reaching their academic goals. My hope is that this scholarship gives more young Black players the confidence to chase their dreams, knowing they have a strong community behind them and a bright future ahead.\" </p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">In recognition of Gauff’s 2023 U.S. Open victory, the United States Tennis Association (USTA) committed $3 million to refurbishing tennis courts across the country. North Carolina Central University was granted $21,000 as a part of this initiative. </p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Coco Gauff has won nine Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) - tour level singles titles including the 2023 US Open and the 2024 WTA Finals.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Ciara Linnane and Bill Peters </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     'We simply need to be faster if we want to innovate around trends,' CEO says </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Estée Lauder Cos. on Tuesday announced plans to cut thousands of jobs and speed up its product development to reclaim relevance in higher-end beauty, after the company swung to a quarterly loss and offered a dimmer outlook amid wobblier shopper sentiment in Asia. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The news sent shares 16% lower on Tuesday afternoon, making the company's stock the S&amp;P 500 index's SPX worst performer on the day. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Estée Lauder (EL) on Tuesday said it now expects to cut 5,800 to 7,000 jobs and book charges of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion before taxes. As of the end of June, Estée Lauder had around 62,000 employees worldwide. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The New York-based company said it expected the move to generate an annual amount of $800 million to $1 billion to help margins and drive reinvestments. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The job cuts came as Estée Lauder on Tuesday also announced plans to expand into higher-priced prestige beauty - an increasingly crowded, competitive slice of the industry - and reorganize the company's business segments and executive ranks. Chief Executive Stéphane de La Faverie, in a video, said the company planned to deliver nearly a third of its product launches in under 12 months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"We have been too slow to seize new opportunities,\" he said. \"We simply need to be faster if we want to innovate around trends.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     He made those remarks as fast fashion and online influencers accelerate the rate at which trends emerge and expire, and as inflation has weighed on consumer spending. Estée Lauder's stock has fallen more than 52% over the past 12 months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, retailers like Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA) - which recently appointed a new chief executive - have faced steeper competition from the likes of Sephora and mass retailers like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Walmart Inc. (WMT) One analyst said that Ulta's makeup selections were too weighted toward legacy brands - like Estée Lauder's namesake line as well as two of its other brands, Clinique and MAC. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Estée Lauder - whose other brands include Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, Jo Malone London, Tom Ford and Aveda - has tried to place more of its products among Amazon's premium beauty selections in an effort to meet customers where they are. Last week, the company announced a collaboration with MIT to research ingredients and other developments in cosmetics. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"While we recognize there is much work to do, we are confident that Beauty Reimagined is the way to realize our ambition,\" de La Faverie said in prepared remarks on Tuesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"We are significantly transforming our operating model to be leaner, faster and more agile, while taking decisive actions to expand consumer coverage, step-change innovation, and increase consumer-facing investments to better capture growth and drive profitability.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The company will take a more competitive approach to procurement by re-evaluating key supplier relationships. It plans to improve efficiencies in its supply chain through a new zero-waste approach. And it will outsource certain services to proven global partners. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Estée Lauder had a per-share loss of $1.64 for the quarter, after earnings of 87 cents a share in the year-earlier period. Adjusted for one-time items, it had earnings per share of 62 cents, almost double the 32-cent FactSet analyst consensus. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Sales fell 6% to $4.004 billion, also ahead of the $3.977 billion FactSet consensus. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The company is now expecting third-quarter sales to fall 10% to 12% and to be down 8% to 10% excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions. It expects adjusted earnings per share of 20 cents to 30 cents, while FactSet is expecting 63 cents. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"While we are not satisfied with our third-quarter outlook, it primarily reflects weak retail sales trends in our Asia travel retail business, which deteriorated in our second quarter driven by Korea,\" said de La Faverie. \"While our retail sales trends in Hainan were still negative in the second quarter, they improved sequentially, fueled by our retail activations.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The company is expecting weak retail trends to continue in Asia in the quarter, pressuring organic net sales. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     See also: Estée Lauder's stock heads for record selloff after profit warning, dividend cut </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Ciara Linnane -Bill Peters </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
