            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     While AMD's PC business beat expectations, its data-center business, which includes AI accelerators, missed the mark </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Advanced Micro Devices Inc. beat expectations with its overall revenue for the latest quarter - and with its outlook for the current one. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     So why is the stock down 4% in Tuesday's extended session? Investors might be disappointed by the source of the beat and what it says about momentum for AMD (AMD) in the data center. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     While AMD's data-center business rose 69% to a record $3.9 billion for the latest quarter, that wasn't enough to clear Wall Street's bar. Analysts tracked by FactSet had been projecting $4.1 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Analysts had been growing more concerned about AMD's data-center trajectory ahead of the report. Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso lowered his AI revenue expectations last month, saying he expected about $7 billion in revenue from that part of the business this year. He previously was modeling at least $10 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     See also: AMD's stock downgraded yet again: 'Believe it or not, it's not due to DeepSeek' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     AMD didn't offer a forecast for 2025 AI revenue in its latest release. The data-center unit also includes revenue from traditional sources unrelated to AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Chief Executive Lisa Su said in prepared remarks posted to the company's site that its recent progress \"places AMD on a steep long-term growth trajectory, led by the rapid scaling of our data-center AI franchise from more than $5 billion of revenue in 2024 to tens of billions of dollars of annual revenue over the coming years.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     AMD also cheered developments related to DeepSeek, the Chinese AI startup, and Stargate, the U.S. joint venture focused on AI infrastructure. \"All of these initiatives require massive amounts of new compute and create unprecedented growth opportunities for AMD across our businesses,\" the company said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     For the latest quarter, the big source of upside was revenue from its client business, which includes personal computers. Sales there rose 58% to $2.3 billion. The FactSet consensus was for $1.9 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The gaming and embedded businesses both saw drops in revenue, reflecting sustained pressures there. Gaming revenue was down 59% to $563 million, with AMD noting a drop in semi-custom sales. And the company pointed to \"mixed\" end-market demand for its embedded unit, which saw revenue fall 13% to $923 million. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Overall, AMD delivered $7.7 billion in revenue versus the $7.5 billion consensus view. And the company is looking for $7.1 billion in revenue during the current quarter, based on the midpoint of its guidance range. Analysts tracked by FactSet had been modeling $7.0 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"Looking into 2025, we see clear opportunities for continued growth based on the strength of our product portfolio and growing demand for high-performance and adaptive computing,\" Su said in a release. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
