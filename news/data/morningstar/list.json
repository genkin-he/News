Without life, we have nothing and without a planet, we definitely have nothing. I thank you for this high honor bestowed upon me, and I take it not in my name but in the name of all those who want a voice for a better planet and for opportunities and peace for the people of the world.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Founder of World Central Kitchen, Chef José Andrés, shared his insights during the ceremony, emphasizing, \"This award is an expression of the values Sheikh Zayed has taught his nation and the world; tolerance, coexistence, understanding and respect, they are the values of the UAE, and I think in our own way, World Central Kitchen seeks to live by these simple principles.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">In his remarks, <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Heman Bekele</span> said, \"I have always been driven by one goal: to equalize access to healthcare—to ensure that life-saving treatments and technologies aren't limited by geography, wealth, or privilege.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Alphabet has been talking nonstop about AI. Now investors are looking for the proof that the company's efforts are working. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Alphabet Inc. has become an artificial-intelligence stock, for better or for worse. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Though advertising still makes up the lion's share of the company's revenue, investors have been focusing more on the part of Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) business that seems the best proxy for AI momentum. That's Google's cloud unit, which came up short in the latest quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     See more: Alphabet's stock slides in the wake of a revenue miss and huge AI spending target </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"If Google wants to be viewed and treated like an AI winner, we need some quantified KPI,\" or key performance indicator, Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik wrote following Alphabet's latest report. While Alphabet grew cloud revenue by 30% in the latest quarter, that was a sharper slowdown than analysts were expecting, he noted. Growth was 35% in the third quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Cloud growth captures the progress Alphabet is making as it works to win market share against Amazon.com Inc.'s (AMZN) Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) Azure. The miss on cloud revenue suggests Alphabet is moving more slowly than anticipated as it tries to make inroads against its larger competitors, according to Shmulik. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"Owning the distant third player in Cloud on the hopes they grab market share on the strength of their AI capabilities is a tough call to make,\" wrote Shmulik, who has a market-perform rating on the stock. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Alphabet's stock is down 8.4% in morning trading Wednesday, putting the company on track to shed $200 billion in market capitalization if the losses carry through to the close, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That would be the company's largest-ever one-day decline in market cap. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Another issue for Alphabet is that investors are scrutinizing the company's high capital spending, particularly in light of supply constraints in the cloud business and search performance that merely met expectations. Alphabet said it expects $75 billion in capital expenditures for the year, whereas analysts had been expecting about $59 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"With that in mind, it is still unclear to us whether Google will be able to extract increased monetization from AI?Overviews\" relative to traditional search-engine results pages, \"or how quickly supply constraints in [the Google Cloud Platform] will be alleviated, so for the time being we alongside investors will need to wait for sharper product development/release signals to materialize,\" UBS analyst Stephen Ju wrote. He has a neutral rating on the stock. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     It's also worth noting that not all AI stocks are treated equally. Meta Platforms Inc. (META) seems to have proven itself more in the eyes of investors, given that its stock actually rose in the face of a higher-than-expected spending forecast. And while Alphabet's stock is trading at a forward price-to-earnings multiple that's roughly in line with its five-year average, Meta's is trading at a premium to its own. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Read: Zuckerberg wants to spend billions more on AI. Meta investors like that idea. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"Shipping products and proving that they will indeed provide incremental multi-year revenue and cash flow growth remains the proof point that [Alphabet] needs to show,\" Morgan Stanley's Brian Nowak wrote. Nowak maintained an overweight rating. In the meantime, Alphabet will likely be looking over its shoulder as Meta has big ambitions to disrupt the search experience for consumers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The index continues to lag the level booked in October, suggesting services businesses remained wary amid the inauguration of Donald Trump to a new term as president. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  \"Like last month, many panelists mentioned preparations or concerns related to potential U.S. government tariff actions,\" said Steve Miller, chairman of ISM's Services Business Survey Committee.

We have had a lot of warehouse closures due to weather,\" one respondent from the wholesale business said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Current production fell back and so did new orders, suggesting a weakness in demand that could continue to hit the usually robust services sector in the months ahead.

Perfusion machines circulate fluid through the kidney, optimizing preservation and providing real-time data on organ viability. But despite decades of clinical evidence demanding continuous perfusion, all the way from donor to recipient, today's machines are too large, unwieldy, and expensive to do the job routinely. With NoMo's small, simple, and smart design, Northernmost intends to eliminate ice coolers altogether.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">This strategic investment aligns with NKF's commitment to advancing innovations that improve kidney transplantation outcomes, reduce organ discard rates, and expand access to life-saving transplants.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\"The way donor kidneys are preserved and transported hasn't changed in decades, and too many viable organs are lost due to outdated methods,\" said <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Kevin Longino</span>, CEO of the National Kidney Foundation and a kidney transplant recipient. \"Northernmost's NoMo Kidney Pump offers a more advanced, portable, and efficient solution to improve transplant outcomes. By investing in this technology, the NKF Innovation Fund is helping to ensure that more kidneys reach patients in optimal condition, reducing waste and saving lives.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">With nearly 90,000 people currently on the kidney transplant waitlist, improving how donor organs are handled is critical. Research indicates that adopting continuous perfusion systems like NoMo could reduce kidney discards by more than 50% and save tens of billions in healthcare costs over the next decade.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\"NKF's support encourages and inspires us,\" said Northernmost CEO <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Ron Mills</span>, a serial entrepreneur in machine preservation. \"We can't wait to introduce NoMo to the transplantation community this summer and to obsolete static cold storage in the years ahead.
