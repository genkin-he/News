The unit will also make batteries for the group's businesses. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The wholly owned unit is expected to make 100,000 vehicles annually, with production scheduled to begin in 2027 or later, the company said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Toyota Motor remained the world's biggest carmaker in 2024, with sales of 10.8 million vehicles globally, as it benefited from a shift among consumers in the U.S. and some other markets to hybrid cars from fully electric vehicles. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  But like many other global carmakers, it struggled in China as a cutthroat price war and consumers' shift away from conventional gas-powered vehicles disrupted the world's largest auto market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Toyota shares rose Wednesday after it boosted its outlook and reported better-than-expected quarterly results. The stock ended 3.1% higher, virtually recouping losses made earlier this week following the U.S. tariff announcement. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The U.S. announced new tariffs against Mexico and Canada on Saturday before striking last-minute deals to delay them. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  To sell cars in the U.S., Japanese automakers like Toyota not only produce them at U.S. plants or import from Japan, but they also make them in Mexico and import to the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Toyota said Wednesday that third-quarter net profit climbed 62% from a year earlier to 2.193 trillion yen, equivalent to $14.21 billion. That exceeded the estimate of Y1.175 trillion in a poll of analysts by data provider Quick. Revenue rose 2.9% to Y12.391 trillion despite lower vehicle sales. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The bottom line was also helped by one-off gains related to a change in the way it holds foreign-currency-denominated assets, the company said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  For the fiscal year ending March, Toyota expects net profit to decline 8.6% to Y4.520 trillion and revenue to increase 4.2% to Y47.000 trillion.

These statements may also relate to our future prospects, expectations, developments, and business strategies. Examples of such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the capital cost of our projects and the timing of project milestones; our ability to obtain financing to meet the funding requirements of our capital investment programme, as well as to fund our ongoing business activities and to pay dividends; statements regarding our future results of operations and financial condition, and regarding future economic performance including cost containment, cash conservation programmes and business optimisation initiatives; recent and proposed accounting pronouncements and their impact on our future results of operations and financial condition; our business strategy, performance outlook, plans, objectives or goals; statements regarding future competition, volume growth and changes in market share in the industries and markets for our products; our existing or anticipated investments, acquisitions of new businesses or the disposal of existing businesses, including estimates or projection of internal rates of return and future profitability; our estimated oil, gas and coal reserves; the probable future outcome of litigation, legislative, regulatory and fiscal developments, including statements regarding our ability to comply with future laws and regulations; future fluctuations in refining margins and crude oil, natural gas and petroleum and chemical product prices; the demand, pricing and cyclicality of oil, gas and petrochemical product prices; changes in the fuel and gas pricing mechanisms in <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">South Africa</span> and their effects on prices, our operating results and profitability; statements regarding future fluctuations in exchange and interest rates and changes in credit ratings; total shareholder return; our current or future products and anticipated customer demand for these products; assumptions relating to macroeconomics; climate change impacts and our climate change strategies, our development of sustainability within our businesses, our energy efficiency improvement, carbon and greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, our net zero carbon emissions ambition and future low-carbon initiatives, including relating to green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel; our estimated carbon tax liability; cyber security; and statements of assumptions underlying such statements. Words such as \"believe\", \"anticipate\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"seek\", \"will\", \"plan\", \"could\", \"may\", \"endeavour\", \"target\", \"forecast\" and \"project\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. By their very nature, forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, and there are risks that the predictions, forecasts, projections, and other forward-looking statements will not be achieved. If one or more of these risks materialise, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated. You should understand that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the plans, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions expressed in such forward-looking statements. These factors and others are discussed more fully in our most recent annual report on Form 20-F filed on <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">6 September 2024</span> and in other filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The list of factors discussed therein is not exhaustive; when relying on forward-looking statements to make investment decisions, you should carefully consider foregoing factors and other uncertainties and events, and you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements apply only as of the date on which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of them, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"> </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-91967a64=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-91967a64=\"\"><source sizes=\"(max-width: 768w)\" srcset=\"https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=IO12265&amp;sd=2025-02-05 1x,https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=IO12265&amp;sd=2025-02-05 2x,https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=IO12265&amp;sd=2025-02-05 3x\"><source sizes=\"(max-width: 1092w)\" srcset=\"https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=IO12265&amp;sd=2025-02-05 1x,https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=IO12265&amp;sd=2025-02-05 2x,https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=IO12265&amp;sd=2025-02-05 3x\"><source sizes=\"(max-width: 600w)\" srcset=\"https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=IO12265&amp;sd=2025-02-05 1x,https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=IO12265&amp;sd=2025-02-05 2x,https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=IO12265&amp;sd=2025-02-05 3x\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=IO12265&amp;sd=2025-02-05\"/></source></source></source></picture></span> View original content:<a class=\"mdc-link mds-link mdc-link--body\" data-v-4234e9e2=\"\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sasol-limited-trading-statement-for-the-six-months-ended-31-december-2024-302368590.html\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sasol-limited-trading-statement-for-the-six-months-ended-31-december-2024-302368590.html</a></p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">SOURCE  Sasol Limited</p>\n</span>\n</div>",

For the full year, sales grew by 7%, reflecting strong contribution from acquisitions of 8%, and a small organic sales decline of 1%. Our operating margin expanded to 16.2%, within the target range of 16-17%.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">In the fourth quarter of 2024, organic sales were stable, with net positive contribution from acquisitions of 6% and currency effects of 1%. Global Technologies delivered strong organic growth of 5% with strong performance in most business areas and with Physical Access Control having comparable figures at normalized levels for the full quarter. Americas delivered good organic growth of 2%, with strong growth in the North America Non-Residential segment and in <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Latin America</span>. Organic sales were stable in EMEIA with commercial segments compensating for continued weak residential demand. Similarly, weak residential markets and weak demand for loading docks resulted in an organic sales decline of 2% in Entrance Systems. <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Asia Pacific's</span> organic sales declined significantly by 11%, mainly due to very weak demand in <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">China</span>.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">The operating profit for the quarter increased by 14% to a record <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">SEK 6,529 M</span> with a corresponding margin of 16.5% (15.5). The operating leverage was very strong at 120 bps, driven by continued price/cost tailwind and strong operational execution, overcompensating for dilution from acquisitions. The operating cash flow increased by 10% in the quarter to a record <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">SEK 8,010 M</span> with a cash conversion of 141% (150).</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Focus on accelerating our sales growth</strong></p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Accelerating organic growth remains a key priority going forward. An important part of our strategy is upgrading the installed base with innovative digital and electromechanical products and solutions. We invest 4% of annual sales in R&amp;D which allows us to strengthen our offering and drive the transition forward. Electromechanical products and solutions are the most important growth driver in our portfolio, with currency adjusted growth of 8% in 2024 and an annual growth rate of 9% in the last ten years in our regional divisions. Through upgrades we can support customers with enhanced security and convenience, but also grow recurring revenue streams. Recurring revenue continues to be a key driver for growth with subscription-based models, service agreements, and digital solutions like remote monitoring and mobile access. In 2024, sales of our subscription-based solutions grew by 18%. Our <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">decentralized</span> organization and region-specific product development provide further opportunities in the emerging markets, that only represent 13% of our sales. In 2024, our currency adjusted sales in emerging markets excluding <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">China</span> grew by 10%.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">A record 26 acquisitions were completed in 2024, adding annualized sales close to <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">SEK 8 bn</span>. In the fourth quarter, we completed eight acquisitions. Acquisitions remain a key driver for growth and the pipeline remains strong.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">By leveraging our market-leading products and solutions with our local knowledge and global presence, we are confident in our ability to drive continued value for our customers, employees and shareholders. Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues for their outstanding contributions during the year and all our stakeholders for your trust.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Stockholm</span>, <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">February 5, 2025</span></p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Nico Delvaux</span><br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/>President and CEO</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Further information can be obtained from:<br data-v-43363f62=\"\"/></strong><span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Nico Delvaux</span>,<br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/>President and CEO, tel. no: +46 8 506 485 82<br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/><br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/>Erik Pieder,<br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/>Executive Vice President and CFO, tel.no: +46 8 506 485 72<br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/><br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/>Björn Tibell,<br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/>Head of Investor Relations, tel. no: +46 70 275 67 68<br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/>e-mail: <a class=\"mdc-link mds-link mdc-link--body\" data-v-4234e9e2=\"\" href=\"mailto:bjorn.tibell@assaabloy.com\" tabindex=\"0\">bjorn.tibell@assaabloy.com</a></p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">ASSA ABLOY is holding a <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">telephone and web conference at 09.00 on <span data-v-43363f62=\"\">February 5, 2025</span></strong> which can be followed online at <a class=\"mdc-link mds-link mdc-link--body\" data-v-4234e9e2=\"\" href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4355872-1&amp;h=3396980910&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.assaabloy.com%2Fse%2Fen&amp;a=assaabloy.com%2Finvestors\" tabindex=\"0\">assaabloy.com/investors</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">It is possible to submit questions by telephone on: 08–505 100 31, +44 207 107 0613 or +1 631 570 5613</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">This information is information that ASSA ABLOY AB is obliged to make public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.
