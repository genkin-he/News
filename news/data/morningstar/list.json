The funds will accelerate development and build capabilities to uncover vulnerabilities in cloud environments. The company also plans to double down its focus on using AI to give developers and security engineers the ability to build security detections. The company has been building its platform since 2018 while remaining cash-positive.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nLast year, Astra Security uncovered nearly 5,500 vulnerabilities per day for its customers with its AI-powered pentest platform. This number is expected to increase threefold by the end of the year as cyber threats continue to evolve at an unprecedented pace. With AI, the speed at which code is being shipped rapidly increases. This means attackers have an even larger attack surface area to find vulnerabilities. AI has become equally popular among hackers for finding loopholes at scale, which can lead to more breaches.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n“The cybercrime landscape is becoming increasingly complex with AI-based attacks,\" said <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Shikhil Sharma, co-founder and CEO of Astra Security</strong>. \"Traditional, periodic pentesting is no longer enough in today’s threat environment, and Astra Security is moving more businesses to continuous pentesting to stay ahead of hackers. The engineering world has become agile, collaborative, and automation-driven, but the cybersecurity industry has lagged behind. It’s our mission to breathe life into the security space by integrating AI, adopting a hacker's mindset, and making the tech easy and accessible.\"\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nOver 800 engineering teams in over 70 countries use Astra Security. AI powers the platform and can constantly mimic hacker behavior to check applications for vulnerabilities through fast detections. This includes PTaaS (Penetration Testing as a Service), a DAST vulnerability scanner, and an API Security Platform that all work together to find over 13,000 vulnerabilities. Last year, Astra Security helped its customers discover and prioritize remediation of over two million vulnerabilities.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n“Security is increasingly shifting to the hands of developers, while security teams find themselves more overwhelmed than ever,” said <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Ananda Krishna, co-founder and CTO of Astra Security</strong>. “While pentests have been around for over a decade, they are overdue for an AI-first update—simplifying and streamlining the process. We’re focused on removing the frustration of continuous security monitoring so businesses can get on with everything else.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nAstra Security founders Shikhil Sharma and Ananda Krishna have been hackers and builders for over a decade—first helping big brands like Microsoft, Adobe, AT&amp;T, Yahoo, and Blackberry find critical vulnerabilities in their infrastructure. This led to the creation of Astra Security and the company’s focus on an AI-powered platform to bring the cybersecurity industry forward.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nAstra’s growth round totaled $2.7 million. The company is rapidly gaining traction among leading organizations. Last year, more than 25% of their customers were mid-sized and large companies, including Loom, HackerRank, ITC, Olx Autos, Mamaearth, Muthoot Finance, Bonusly Singapore Trade Exchange, Oscilar, University of Cambridge, CompTIA, and Prime Healthcare.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">About Astra Security</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nAstra Security is a cyber security SaaS company simplifying otherwise chaotic penetration with its Pentest Platform. Astra Security's AI-powered offensive vulnerability scanning engine emulates hacker behavior to scan applications for 10,000+ security tests. CTOs &amp; CISOs trust Astra Security because it helps them fix vulnerabilities in record time and move from DevOps to DevSecOps with Astra Security's CI/CD integrations.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n800+ companies across the globe use Astra Security. Last year, Astra Security uncovered 2,000,000+ vulnerabilities for its customers, saving customers $69M+ in potential losses due to security vulnerabilities.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-91967a64=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-91967a64=\"\"><source sizes=\"(max-width: 768w)\" srcset=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250205502953r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 1x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250205502953r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 2x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250205502953r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 3x\"><source sizes=\"(max-width: 1092w)\" srcset=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250205502953r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 1x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250205502953r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 2x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250205502953r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 3x\"><source sizes=\"(max-width: 600w)\" srcset=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250205502953r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 1x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250205502953r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 2x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250205502953r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 3x\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250205502953r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en\"/></source></source></source></picture></span><span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"></span></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Media Contact \n</strong><br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/><a class=\"mdc-link mds-link mdc-link--body\" data-v-4234e9e2=\"\" href=\"mailto:onboard@sbscomms.com\" tabindex=\"0\">onboard@sbscomms.com</a>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">View source version on businesswire.com: </span><span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><a class=\"mdc-link mds-link mdc-link--body\" data-v-4234e9e2=\"\" href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250205502953/en/\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250205502953/en/</a></span></p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Robb M. Stewart </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  OTTAWA--Canada swung to a global trade surplus for the first time in 10 months at the end of last year as the local currency continued to weaken and energy shipments to the U.S. rose. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The country posted a merchandise-trade surplus in December of 708 million Canadian dollars, the equivalent of about $494.3 million, Statistics Canada said Wednesday. That was narrower than the C$1.03 billion surplus expected by economists and comes after November's deficit was revised upward by C$663 million to C$986 million. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n   The shift for the month still left Canada with a deficit with the world of about C$7.2 billion, much wider than the C$610 million shortfall the year before. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The country's merchandise exports in December increased 4.9% to C$69.46 billion, while imports rose 2.3% to C$68.76 billion, the data agency said. For the year, imports advanced 1.9% to outpace a 1.0% lift in global exports. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Economic growth in Canada picked up over the final quarter of last year following a string of interest rate cuts by the central bank since June as inflation has cooled. There remains a great deal of uncertainty over what 2025 will bring as the country braces for possible U.S. tariffs on imports from Canada. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The rise in exports in December was the largest since last February, though the growth was due in part to the sharp depreciation of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar for a third month running, given a large portion of trade is completed in the U.S. currency. In volume terms, exports for the month were up 2.6% from November. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Exports of energy products jumped 9.5% from the month before, with a rise in the value of crude oil. Exports of mineral products also rose strongly, and Canada shipped more motor vehicles and parts, as well as farm, fishing and intermediate food products for the month. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  In preparation for President Trump's threatened levies, some businesses accelerated shipments. A KPMG survey of 250 business leaders across Canada last month found 65% preemptively shipped goods or products ahead of Trump's inauguration and almost half have plans to shift investment and would set up operations or production south of the border to serve the U.S. market and reduce costs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Trump on Monday struck last-minute deals to delay by one month plans to levy hefty tariffs on Canada to see if in that time an \"economic deal\" with Canada can be structured. Trump has repeatedly complained about America's trade deficit with its northern neighbor. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Statistics Canada's data showed Canada's long-standing surplus with the U.S. narrowed slightly last year to roughly C$102.2 billion from C$108.3 billion in 2023. Cross-border trade between the two countries topped the C$1 trillion mark for a third consecutive year in 2024, with the U.S. the destination for almost 76% of all exports and the source for some 62% of overall imports. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Energy products remain the key to Canada's surplus with its neighbor. The country exported about C$176.2 billion of energy last year, roughly 88% of which went to the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  For December, Canada's exports to the U.S. were up 5.0% following a 6.7% rise the month before. The same month, imports of U.S. goods fell 1.5%, which widened the trade surplus between the countries to C$11.34 billion from C$8.19 billion in November. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  That came as Canada's deficit with countries other than the U.S. widened to roughly C$10.6 billion in December from C$9.2 billion the month before. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  When international trade in goods and international trade in services were combined, Canadian exports rose 4.1% in December, while imports increased 1.6%. As a result, Canada's trade incorporating both goods and services swung to a surplus of C$641 million in December from a C$1.43 billion deficit the month before. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Combining both services and goods traded with the U.S. over the last year, and Canada recorded an overall trade surplus of about C$94.4 billion with its neighbor. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Write to Robb M.
