            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\"><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Momentus Selected by U.S. Air Force for Space Demonstration </strong><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">of Rendezvous Using Low-Cost Multi-Spectral Sensor Suite</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nMomentus Inc. (NASDAQ: MNTS), a U.S. commercial space company offering satellite buses, technologies, transportation, and other in-space transportation services, today announced that the U.S. Air Force Research Labs AFWERX organization has selected a proposal from Momentus to perform an in-space demonstration flight of a new, low-cost suite of multispectral sensors for Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO).\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nAFWERX is the innovation arm of the U.S. Air Force under the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). AFWERX has been chartered to bring cutting-edge ingenuity from small businesses to address the most pressing challenges of the Air Force.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nIn 2024, Momentus submitted a proposal under the AFWERX Challenge and was recently formally notified that its proposal for a Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project to perform a multi-spectral RPO demonstration was selected after evaluation in a competitive process. Momentus expects to complete contract negotiations shortly. This selection underscores Momentus' commitment to pioneering innovative solutions for national defense.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nUnder the SBIR project, Momentus plans to use a Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO) system it has developed using internal R&amp;D funds and use an optical sensor, infrared sensor, and a Lidar sensor. (Lidar is a remote-sensing technology that uses laser beams to measure distances and movement in an environment.)\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nA flight demonstration in early 2026 is planned that will show the ability for low-cost RPO sensors to safely guide the approach and rendezvous of a space vehicle with a previously uncharacterized client object using machine vision algorithms and data fusion developed by Momentus. Reducing the cost while ensuring high operational safety for in-space rendezvous is a key enabling technology needed for the future of in-space refueling of satellites, manufacturing, assembly, servicing, and debris removal.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nThe rendezvous sensor demonstration for AFWERX will join other payloads, including from the Department of Defense and commercial customers, on a mission that Momentus has contracted with SpaceX to join a Transporter rideshare launch in early 2026.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nFor this mission, Momentus has additional capacity to support customers planning LEO deployment and hosted payload missions in early 2026. Government and commercial customers interested in utilizing the ability of the Vigoride vehicle to cost-effectively launch and deliver microsatellites up to 200 kg and cubesats, provide average power up to 1kW, and deploy or operate hosted payloads in orbits above 500 km and below the International Space Station are encouraged to contact Momentus while booking opportunities remain open at <a class=\"mdc-link mds-link mdc-link--body\" data-v-4234e9e2=\"\" href=\"mailto:sales@momentusspace.com\" tabindex=\"0\">sales@momentusspace.com</a>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n“We’re thrilled to be selected to perform this in-space demonstration to support the U.S. Air Force with cutting-edge technology,” said Momentus Chief Executive Officer John Rood. \"We’re at a key juncture in the development of technology to enable new operations in space that are critical to America’s security and commercial operations in space. We see this selection as an exceptional opportunity to continue Momentus technology leadership to support national security and new commercial activities.\"\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">About Momentus Inc.</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nMomentus is a U.S. commercial space company that offers commercial satellite buses and in-space infrastructure services including in-space transportation, hosted payloads, and other in-orbit services.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Forward-Looking Statements</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nThis press release contains certain statements which may constitute “forward-looking statements” for purposes of the federal securities laws.

While everyone should have equal access to mental health services, factors such as race, gender, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and sexual orientation are shown to play a role in how fairly people are treated in the mental health care system of today.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Statistics show that white adults are more likely to receive mental health services as opposed to their Black and Hispanic counterparts. While 50% of women ages 18-64 reported needing mental health services in the past year in one study, only half of those were able to get treatment. Nearly half of LGBT adults say they needed mental health care in the past three years but didn't get it.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\"People need help, but they aren't getting it,\" said Waldman. \"The fact is that our minds are making us sick, and the mental health system isn't working. The great news is that there's a better way, a way that doesn't require people to rely solely on a framework that isn't working.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Instead, says Waldman, people can use a philosophy created by his group, the Brainyites. The Brainyites support better mental health by way of better cognition. By retraining the brain through simple yet dynamic practices, people can become more resilient while becoming healthier and happier. \"We are initiating a conversation that addresses the fear and mistrust that can rob us of the life we say we want,\" said Waldman.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">The Brainyites are calling upon journalists, influencers, and anyone with a voice to help make a change and stand up for those who need help in the face of a failing mental health system.
