And it said it expects 2025 to be a better year for Barbie, after 2024 faced a higher bar to clear due to the boost it got in 2023 by the blockbuster film based on the iconic doll. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     And as it tries to turn more of its classic toys into films, shows, games and other content, management said it expects Mattel (MAT) to become a bigger entertainment company. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"We believe Mattel is well-positioned to increase market share in our entertainment business in 2025,\" Chief Executive Ynon Kreiz said on Mattel's earnings call. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"We expect progress to continue on our two films in production and 14 announced films in development,\" he continued. \"More shows to launch on Netflix, including 'Hot Wheels Let's Race' Season 3, Barbie's next animated special, and new seasons of 'Thomas &amp; Friends' and 'Polly Pocket.'\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Shares were up 10.3% after hours. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The company said it expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.66 to $1.72 for 2025. That forecast was above FactSet estimates for $1.57. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The outlook, Mattel said, factored in \"the anticipated impact of new U.S. tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada imports announced on February 1st,\" as well as actions the company planned to take to address the new duties, some of which have been put on hold for at least 30 days. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Those actions, Mattel said, included \"leveraging the strength of our supply chain.\" But the company said its response could include actions related to \"potential pricing.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Trump over the weekend said the U.S. would put 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, with a 10% additional tariff on imports from China. Energy from Canada would be taxed at 10%. Mexico and Canada on Monday worked out deals to keep those tariffs from taking hold for roughly another month. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Economists have said that Trump's tariffs - intended to extract concessions on trade and other issues from other nations - will likely prompt businesses to raise prices to some degree, as they pass on the extra costs of those import taxes on to shoppers. Those shoppers have already been dealing with three years of higher costs of living, which has weighed on demand for items like toys. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     UBS analysts have said that Mattel and its rival Hasbro Inc. (HAS) weren't as vulnerable to tariffs as some of their rivals, as they had less exposure to China. UBS analyst Arpine Kocharyan said in October that the toy industry overall had \"80% exposure to?China.\" Around 50% of Mattel's products are made in China, she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     For the fourth quarter, Mattel reported $1.65 billion in sales, up 2%. Adjusted earnings per share were 35 cents. Both were above FactSet forecasts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Overall, Mattel saw an increase in gross billings, a gauge of what retail stores buy from the company, in North America and internationally. But for dolls, mainly Barbie dolls, they fell. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Ahead of Tuesday's results, Kocharyan said that despite a possible slowdown from the shorter traditional holiday shopping season - from Thanksgiving through Christmas - there was room for optimism for the period. She said the weaker showing from Barbie had already been appropriately telegraphed by the company and understood by Wall Street. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"Barbie declines are expected and in guidance,\" she said in a note on Monday. \"Overall, Mattel saw strength in Hot Wheels and in dolls driven by 'Moana' theatrical release in Q4.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Bill Peters </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The stock is up 18.6% over the past 12 months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Ahead of the results, analysts were focused on whether the chain could keep up same-store sales growth this year, following solid trends last year, as shoppers grappling with higher costs of living remain picky about dining out. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Some analysts said tougher comparisons, harsher weather and holiday timing may have put pressure on Chipotle's recent sales. But while fast-food chains, after raising prices, have tried to win back consumers with value deals, some analysts say customers believe they can get a better meal at fast-casual chains for a price that's not much higher. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Chipotle's management, during the call, said they were focused on opening more restaurants internationally, while outfitting its new restaurants with upgraded equipment - like rice cookers, faster-cooking grills and fryers that can fry more chips - that can help with faster, more consistent service. The company has a goal to open 7,000 restaurants in North America. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Executives said they planned to launch a new limited-time menu offering around mid- to late March, and expressed excitement about menu items to come later in the year. And as businesses race to find more ways to use artificial intelligence, Chipotle said it was developing ways to deploy the technology to keep customers from drifting toward other options. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"When the model detects that a customer's behavior is changing in a particular way that would signal the propensity for churn, we will take them on a new journey with personalized extras and offers to encourage them to re-engage,\" Scott Boatwright, Chipotle's new chief executive, said on the call. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"I think those things are going to drive meaningful difference within the digital channel,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     For the fourth quarter, Chipotle reported revenue of $2.845 billion, up 13.1% year over year, with same-store sales up 5.4%. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 25 cents. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Analysts polled by FactSet expected Chipotle to report adjusted earnings per share of 24 cents, on sales of $2.85 billion and a same-store sales gain of 5.7%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Chipotle executives, during the call on Tuesday, said items like its limited-time brisket offer were popular with diners, even though it was a difficult  item to procure. But they said that a multi-year absence from Chipotle's menu helped build up anticipation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"I know I probably ate it once a week throughout the entire season,\" Boatwright said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Bill Peters </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Echoing remarks by many of his colleagues on the Fed's monetary-policy committee in recent months, Jefferson said he thinks that risks to the Fed's two goals--controlling inflation, and maintaining a thriving labor market--are now roughly balanced. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  That has set the stage for what many on Wall Street think will be a pause in further rate cuts perhaps until May or June at the soonest, as reflected in traders' bets in interest-rate futures markets. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Questions about Trump administration economic policy, including on immigration and trade, have clouded the picture of how inflation and the labor market will evolve in the next few months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Jefferson said that \"currently we face additional uncertainties about the exact shape of government policies, as well as their economic implications.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Separately, Jefferson said he expects slower economic growth this year than in 2024, in part because households and businesses \"face an uncertain environment.\" Jefferson said growth could surpass his expectations if consumer spending proves more resilient than he has forecast. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  February 04, 2025 19:44 ET (00:44 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",
