Stocks are trying to pull into the green for Tuesday, even as China has now jumped into the tariff fray. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     That's as we're still in the belly of earnings season, with results from a big Nvidia competitor looming after the close. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Stepping away from the headlines that make the market these days, our call of the day from Bank of America flags a contrarian stock market indicator that they say is just a whisker away from a \"sell signal.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     BofA's sell side indicator, tracks average recommended equity allocations by Wall Street strategists. In January, that indicator climbed to 57%, the highest since early 2022 and a mere 1 percentage point shy from a sell signal, Savita Subramanian, equity and quant strategist, and her colleague Victoria Roloff, told clients in a note. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     In other words, when so many strategists are saying buy stocks, the best plan of action may be to not follow the herd. When the indicator has been at the 57% level or higher, returns for the next 12 months were positive  65% of the time versus 82% overall, BofA said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     So the bank's voicing caution in a crowded market, as they put it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"The [sell-side indicator] has been a reliable contrarian indicator. In other words, it has been bullish when Wall Street was extremely bearish and vice versa,\" and now sits at the closest to a sell signal since December 2021, said Subramanian and Roloff. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Last month, those strategists left their equity allocations unchanged after a 2.8% gain for the S&amp;P 500 SPX in December, which suggests a wait-and-see approach on trade tensions and any policy risks, said the BofA team. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"The current level of 57% implies an estimated price return of 10.5% over the [next twelve months], lower than the past two years but still healthy. We see this as support for our view that 2025 is a year for buying stocks, not the index,\" they said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Societe Generale has predicted 2025 will be the best stock picking period in 25 years, citing reflationary policies from President Trump's administration, such as lower taxes, less regulation and lower oil prices, which they say can all yield potential stock picking ideas. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Plus: Stock market's wild ride on Monday could be a microcosm of what to expect in 2025 </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The markets </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     U.S. stocks DJIA SPX COMP are trying to push higher in early trade, though the Dow industrials are lagging.
