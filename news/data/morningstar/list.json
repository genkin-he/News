            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Bill Peters </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     'The consumer is not positioned to pay more for discretionary goods given pressures elsewhere in their budgets,' BofA analysts say </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Lots of clothes on store shelves could get a bit more expensive if new tariffs announced by President Donald Trump over the weekend eventually take hold. But after three years of price increases and higher costs of living, some Wall Street analysts say shoppers might be too worn out to buy any of it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"We don't expect apparel retailers to be successful in passing through costs to consumers; the consumer is not positioned to pay more for discretionary goods given pressures elsewhere in their budgets,\" BofA analysts said in a research note on Monday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Still, the BofA analysts said, the new tariffs' impact on specialty retailers and department stores would pressure profit margins \"only modestly as imports from those countries are limited.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Trump over the weekend said the U.S. would impose a 25% additional tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada - although energy from Canada will be taxed at 10% - with a 10% additional tariff on imports from China. Mexico and Canada on Monday worked out agreements to keep the tariffs from going into effect for another month. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Economists have said any new tariffs risked pushing prices higher, as the businesses importing products pass the extra costs of those duties onto shoppers. How much prices might rise while the tariffs are in place isn't exactly clear. Different companies might absorb those extra costs more than others. But some analysts have said retailers, which often run on narrow margins, have little choice but to pass the costs onto shoppers via price increases. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Teen-centric discount retailer Five Below (FIVE), the analysts at BofA said, was among the chains that imported a lot of things from China. Footwear maker Skechers USA (SKX), they said, was another. Western-wear chain Boot Barn (BOOT), the analysts said, got 30% of its items from China and 25% from Mexico. Most of the goods sourced by department-store chain Kohl's Corp. (KSS), were made outside the U.S., and largely in Asia. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Elsewhere, analysts at UBS on Monday noted that shoe maker Steve Madden (SHOO) relied heavily on China for products, even as the company tries to shift production elsewhere. Winter-jacket maker Canada Goose (GOOS), they said, relied solely on Canada. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The UBS analysts also said that the cost of goods sold - or the cost to make and sell things - could rise 9% for Boot Barn and 25% for Canada Goose due to the tariffs. However, they said that the average \"softline\" company they followed - those being businesses that make and sell things like clothing and linens - would only see a 1.6% increase in cost of goods sold because of the new tariffs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The BofA analysts on Monday said that the full impact from the new tariffs, if they happen, might not emerge until several months from now. The topic is likely to be a big one on earnings calls in the weeks ahead, they said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     However, they said that a \"universal\" tariff - Trump has proposed a tariff of at least 10% on all imports - would chew more deeply into retailers' gross margins. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"In a universal tariff scenario, we estimate that a company selling products with an average unit cost (AUC) of $10 and retail price of $75 would have to raise prices by almost $2 (3%) to offset the incremental [gross margin] headwind,\" they said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     But as markets and retailers digest the current trade friction, both BofA and UBS said shares of off-price chains could be safer bets. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"We view off-price retailers as relatively insulated from tariff risk as they primarily source domestically,\" BofA said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The UBS analysts said: \"In the short term, rising uncertainty probably isn't good for stocks.\" Thus, they said, investors could shift their money toward names like TJX Cos. (TJX), which owns TJ Maxx, and Burlington Stores Inc. (BURL). </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"Furthermore, tariffs likely create meaningful supply-chain dislocation,\" the UBS analysts said. \"This is another reason to buy off-price stocks since these companies typically outperform in times of dislocation.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The White House, in its announcement on Saturday, cited the \"extraordinary threat posed by illegal aliens and drugs, including deadly fentanyl\" as the reason for the tariffs set to start this week. The additional levies, it said, were intended to ensure the three nations addressed those issues. More broadly, the Trump camp has said tariffs would help revive U.S. jobs and manufacturing, or function as a tool to extract trade deals and other concessions that favor the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     But clothing makers, after relying on low-paying labor to pad profits, likely wouldn't want to pay the extra money to shift production back to the U.S., the BofA analysts said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"Moving manufacturing to the U.S. is not feasible because it requires large capital investment and there is a significant differential in labor costs: Apparel is labor intensive and the minimum wage in Vietnam is only $150-$200 a month,\" they said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Bill Peters </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Kimberley Kao </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Markets across Asia staged a relief rally after U.S. President Trump agreed to postpone the start of tariffs on Mexico and Canada by a month, suggesting that a reversal is possible. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was recently 1.1% higher on Tuesday, led by gains in auto and electronic stocks. Hong Kong's benchmark index rose 2.0% and South Korea's Kospi gained 1.5%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The rebound came after the U.S. struck last-minute deals with Mexico and Canada to delay new tariffs, after separate calls with the leaders of both nations. China, another tariff target, is also preparing to talk trade with Trump. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Trump's aggressive move to place tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in imports rattled investors, economists and some lawmakers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  In a social media post, Trump said that his administration will see in the next 30 days if an \"economic deal\" with Canada can be structured. He made similar comments about Mexico earlier Monday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  \"A headlines-driven market seems synonymous with Trump 2.0, much like in 2016,\" Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG, said in a note. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The extended timeline for Mexico and Canada can provide immediate relief for risk sentiment, Yeap said. \"More importantly, it underscores President Trump's willingness to negotiate, potentially with tariff moves as bargaining chips rather than firm policy decisions.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Oliver Blackbourn, multiasset portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said that the quick reappraisal on tariffs suggests that there might be a way out. It \"gave markets hope that this could be a short-lived episode, although perhaps this is only the case with Mexico and Canada,\" he said in a commentary. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Other Asian stock markets were broadly higher. Taiwan's Taiex index gained 0.7% and Malaysia's benchmark Kuala Lumpur Composite Index rose 0.5%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Currency markets, which have whipsawed during the barrage of tariff news, breathed a small sigh of relief over the delays. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The yen weakened against most other G-10 and Asian currencies as sentiment toward risk assets rebounded. The Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso clawed back ground lost after the initial jolt. Asian currencies broadly rose against the U.S. dollar. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The offshore yuan strengthened in a possible reflection of expectations that China too will get a tariff reprieve, Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho Securities' head of macro research for Asia, excluding Japan, said in a note. But the \"overarching geo-economic dimensions to U.S.-China trade means that resolution will be far more fraught than is the case with Mexico and Canada,\" he cautioned. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Relief isn't resolution, as Trump has warned that tariff plans are intact, Varathan said. U.S.-driven trade antagonism threats remain at large, and \"it promises to be a bumpy ride for markets in the weeks ahead,\" with currency markets set up to be the most sensitive to U.S. tariff threats, he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The euro, Korean won, Thai baht, Malaysian ringgit, Australian dollar and offshore yuan remain on the line, Varathan said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Until recently, many on Wall Street viewed threats of the U.S. imposing the highest tariffs in decades as a negotiating tactic in border disputes over drug trafficking and migration and unlikely to materialize. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  \"We still think that permanent tariffs on the U.S.'s allies (Canada, Mexico) will not be a thing,\" said Thierry Wizman, global foreign-exchange and rates strategist at Macquarie. \"Tariffs [are] likely to be reversed before they do serious damage.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  \"That's because concessions are an 'easier' way to deal with Trump's 'problems'...and Trump likes to make 'deals,'\" Wizman said in a note. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  --Fabiana Negrin Ochoa, Ronnie Harui and Farah Elias contributed to this article. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Write to Kimberley Kao at kimberley.kao@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  February 03, 2025 23:20 ET (04:20 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",
