            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Anna Scherbina and Joel Lander </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Traditional insurance models aren't able to handle escalating natural disaster risks </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     A major hurricane striking Miami or Manhattan could make the hurricane Helene and the Palisades Fire look like trivial events. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The Los Angeles wildfires have caused economic losses currently estimated in the range of $250 to $275 billion. Meanwhile, insurance is disappearing. Many homeowners now choose to go skip insurance altogether, owing to the difficulty of obtaining coverage at all or even at a reasonable price. Insurance coverage has been diminishing in many respects, with rising deductibles and exclusions that effectively mean there is less true coverage. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Hurricane Helene struck the southeastern United States in September 2024, resulting in total personal property damages between $31 and $48 billion, of which $20-$30 billion were uninsured flood losses. The averages of these ranges indicate that insured losses covered about two-thirds of the total damages - leaving property owners responsible for the remainder. In North Carolina's Buncombe County, where flooding from Hurricane Helene resulted in over 57 fatalities, federal flood insurance covered less than 1% of homes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The 2018 Camp Fire in California, personal property losses accounted for approximately 86% of the total losses, and if this fraction applies to the current Los Angeles fires, households stand to lose between $215 and $237 billion. That might be an overestimate if business losses are a higher share, but is indicative. With insurers expected to cover about $30 billion, these numbers imply  that just 13% of such damages will be covered by insurance, and mostly property owners and the government will shoulder the remaining 87%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Risk is difficult to estimate and to price reasonably - which could lead to oscillating enormous profits and losses for insurance companies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Both Florida and California are trying to stem the loss of insurers. Just before the L.A. fires, California regulators announced they would allow climate risk assessments to justify higher insurance premiums. But this is far from a perfect fix. Part of the problem is that the risk of extreme losses has increased well in excess of historical events. This risk is difficult to estimate and to price reasonably - which could lead to oscillating enormous profits and losses for insurance companies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     For instance, a major hurricane striking Miami or Manhattan could make the hurricane Helene and the Palisades Fire look like trivial events. Would insurers have accumulated sufficient reserves from prior potentially extremely profitable years to cover those kinds of losses? Politically and otherwise, such an uncertain insurance scheme is challenging to make workable. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The traditional insurance model is no longer viable in the face of escalating climate risks that also create systemic financial pressures. The future of insurance must address these challenges by shifting toward models that manage risk and align incentives in better ways. By adopting innovative solutions such as bundled mortgage-insurance models, fairer pricing, and more efficient risk management through financial innovation, the industry can reinvent itself to meet the challenges of a changing world. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Insuring the uninsurable </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Mortgage originators require homeowners to purchase insurance, but leave the search costs to the borrowers, who are likely less informed than lenders about the quality and prices of various insurance providers. A better model could help insulate banks from mortgage losses due to climate risks, and thereby reduce systemic risks posed by natural disasters. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n      Integrate insurance directly into mortgage payments. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     One approach would be to integrate insurance directly into mortgage payments. Mortgages would include interest and principal payments as they do now, but also with a high-deductible insurance component that protects the bank's principal. This insurance component would be dynamically priced according to changing conditions related to risk and repair and replacement costs. Consumers able and wanting more insurance could buy supplemental policies. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Combining the bundled and supplemental insurance would approximate traditional coverage. However, the high costs suggest many would opt only for the bundled insurance. Homeowners could mitigate the impacts from natural disasters by choosing more resilient structures, or, conversely, opt for low-cost structures that could be rebuilt quickly without large financial burdens. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Further financial innovation, of which catastrophe bonds is one example, would allow insurance companies to offload some climate risks to well-diversified and geographically dispersed investors. This mechanism would distribute risk more fairly and effectively than the current regulatory processes that often shift risks to taxpayers, or ongoing insurance pricing practices that offload risks to other policy holders. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Bad actions from insurance companies deserve some of the vitriol against them. Yet insurance companies can serve beneficial roles and can be reinvented in a way that preserves what is valuable, such as facilitating risk sharing and acting as information intermediaries. By helping policyholders understand risks and reduce informational disadvantages, insurers can regain public trust and better serve their role in society.  As disasters worsen, such reinvention is not merely desirable - it is essential for the survival of both insurers and those they serve. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Anna Scherbina is a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and a professor of finance at Brandeis University's International Business School. At AEI, her research is focused on behavioral finance, cybersecurity, investment management, asset pricing, and real estate as an asset class. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Joel Lander is a consultant and cofounder of Tatari Inc. He earned his PhD in economics at UCLA and worked at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors as an economist. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     More: Who gets to rebuild? Los Angeles fires expose the weakness of U.S. home insurance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Plus: More homeowners are being denied insurance.

            "title": "Trump, tariffs and your 401(k) - why it's time to diversify",
            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Brett Arends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Putting all your eggs in one basket is an especially bad idea now </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     At moments like this, I think of Doug Ramsey. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     He's the chief investment officer of Leuthold Group, a Midwestern money-management company. Ramsey has long been running a theoretical portfolio called \"All Asset No Authority.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Instead of going all in on the S&amp;P 500 SPX and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, which has been the Wall Street mania in recent years, this portfolio spreads its bets equally across what Ramsey considers to be the seven major asset classes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     That means three-sevenths of the money, or 43%, is invested in gold, commodity futures and Treasury bonds. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     And those all happened to keep their cool during the Trump tariff panic on Monday morning as the rest of the financial world wobbled. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Gold (GC00) jumped another $20 an ounce, hitting a fresh record of $2,855, after the Trump administration's weekend announcement of new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. Gold has risen more than 8% just since the start of the year and 900% since the start of the millennium. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, Treasury bills BX:TMUBMUSD03M and bonds BX:TMUBMUSD10Y held their value Monday, as did commodity futures - helped by a jump in oil prices. The iShares S&amp;P GSCI Commodity Indexed exchange-traded fund GSG, Invesco DB Commodity Index fund DBC and iShares Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Strategy ETF CMDY all edged into the black during morning trading that day. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     At the same time, the S&amp;P 500 index of large company stocks fell by nearly 1% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped by more than 1%. Small U.S. company stocks, as tracked by the Russell 2000 index RUT, also fell. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"The secular bull market in U.S. stocks since 2009 has been accompanied throughout by a secular bear market in diversification,\" Ramsey tells me. \"If U.S. large-cap stocks stall out over the next few years, many investors will find out just how dependent their returns have been on just a handful of stocks.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The All Asset No Authority portfolio idea may seem wild and off the wall, especially compared with conventional investment approaches. Most people invest their 401(k) plans, IRAs and other retirement accounts in stocks, along with bonds. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     But there is method to the madness. Bonds, gold and commodities in particular have provided diversification benefits in the past that investors haven't been able to get from stocks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Consider, for example, three long periods in the past century when investors in the S&amp;P 500 got completely hosed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     These were from 1937 to 1947, from 1965 to 1981 and from 2000 to 2012. On all three occasions, someone who invested $1 in the S&amp;P 500 at the start would have ended up with less than a dollar, after accounting for inflation, at the end. And that's before deducting investment fees and taxes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     But in all three cases, data from Dartmouth College finance professor Kenneth French show, someone who had bet on energy and commodities (using energy stocks as a proxy) actually made good money. During the first period, energy stocks earned you a total return of 45%. In the second, they doubled your money. In the third, they nearly tripled your money. Each of these calculations, incidentally, is in real terms, meaning after deducting for inflation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Legendary investor and stock-market contrarian Jeremy Grantham, founder of the white-shoe investment firm GMO in Boston, reported a year ago that since 1970, resource stocks, meaning those that invest in energy and in mining, have been \"far and away the most diversifying sector\" of the market. \"At longer horizons (10 years) resources are the only sector of the stock market to be negatively correlated with the broad stock market,\" he wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The data on gold is sketchier, because the price was effectively suppressed by the federal government from the 1930s to the early 1970s. But the price went up tenfold from 1969 to 1981 and nearly sixfold from 1999 to 2012, far outpacing inflation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Note that gold today is very expensive by historic measures. It has more than doubled in the past decade. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Meanwhile the data on Treasury bonds is mixed, because although they were terrific during the deflationary crash of 1929-32 that started the Great Depression and from 2000 to 2012, they were terrible during the inflationary stock-market slumps of the 1940s and 1970s. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     As for Treasury bills, generally referred to on Wall Street as \"cash\": They were a terrible investment during World War II and over the last decade, when the federal government suppressed short-term interest rates. But they held up well - and better than stocks - during other bear markets. They even kept up with inflation (just) during the bear market in stocks of the 1960s and 1970s. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Veteran financial consultant Andrew Smithers, author of the 2009 book \"Wall Street Revalued: Imperfect Markets and Inept Central Bankers,\" calculated that Treasury bills were a better diversifier to a stock portfolio than bonds. Warren Buffett has urged his heirs to keep 90% of his fortune in the S&amp;P 500 but 10% in Treasury bills. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Bulls like to argue that they don't need to diversify. The S&amp;P 500 has been such a great investment for so long, they can ignore everything else. But they are cherry-picking. They cheerfully cite data from the past 100 years to show that stocks outperform over the long run, but not data that show those same stocks often did very badly indeed, and for very long periods. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     So they will argue that the stock-market performance for the years and decades ahead will match its performance over the past 100 years - but only the good parts. The garden will bloom every spring and summer, but winters will never come. Maybe they're right. Then again, maybe not. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Brett Arends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Job openings in the U.S. fell at the end of 2024 to the second-lowest level since the end of the pandemic. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Job postings dropped to 7.6 million in December from 8.2 million in the prior month, the government said Tuesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Openings have fallen in fits and starts over the past two years and are down by more than one-third from a record 12.2 million in 2022. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     It's also taking people who lose a job a lot longer to find one. The number of people collecting unemployment benefits has risen to the highest level since 2018 if the COVID-19-influenced pandemic years are omitted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     There's also been a sharp increase in the number of people who've been unemployed for more than six months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     In any case, the latest job-openings report suggests the labor market might not be quite as strong as the employment increases for November and December indicated. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The government will offer more clues via the January employment report on Friday, which will also reflect revisions to last year's job estimates. Some economists think the employment report has exaggerated job gains. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Key details: Job openings sank in December in finance, professional occupations, healthcare and construction. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The number of job quitters was little changed at 3.2 million, well below a record 4.3 million in the spring of 2022. Fewer people quit when jobs are harder to find. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Not many people are being fired, though. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The so-called layoff rate, which reveals whether lots of people are losing jobs, ended the year at just 1.1%. That's just two ticks above a record low. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Looking ahead: The job openings report \"underscores that businesses are pulling back on the rate of new job openings and hiring,\" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. \"At the same time, companies are holding on tight to current workers as layoffs remain very low.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Big picture: Some companies have been ramping up hiring plans in anticipation of tax cuts and a reduction in regulations under the Trump administration. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Yet the president's threat of higher tariffs sparking a trade war has also unsettled business leaders and increased uncertainty. It's unclear whether they will proceed with their hiring plans until the dusk settles. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Market reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA and S&amp;P 500 SPX rose in Tuesday trading after a trade war with Mexico and Canada was temporarily averted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Jeffry Bartash </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
