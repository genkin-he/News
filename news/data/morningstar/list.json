It is a Layer 1 network that is both EVM-compatible and powered by a unique Proof of Liquidity (PoL) consensus mechanism. With this mechanism, validators not only stake tokens but also provide liquidity. Through its Proof of Liquidity (PoL) model, Berachain leverages active liquidity providers to secure the network, effectively turning capital into a core security resource.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">This groundbreaking approach has attracted significant financial backing, with the project raising $142 million in its latest funding round. As of January 2, the Berachain official website reports that 234 protocols are actively participating in its bArtio Testnet. BERA is a gas token, used for transactions and staking within its ecosystem.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Berachain, powered by the BeaconKit modular consensus layer and built on the Cosmos SDK, offers flexibility for Ethereum-based blockchains. It enables developers to create both Layer-1 and Layer-2 solutions without needing to rewrite programming languages. Recently, Berachain launched Boyco, a pre-launch liquidity platform in collaboration with Enso and LayerZero, designed to address the cold start issue for new decentralized applications. Boyco's pre-deposit vaults have already reached $2.2 billion.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Celebrate the BERA Launch with a prize pool of 19,100 BERA &amp; 50,000 USDT<br data-v-43363f62=\"\"/></strong>In a significant show of support for Berachain and its expansive ecosystem, MEXC is set to list the new BERA token.

Revenue rose 2.9% to Y12.391 trillion despite lower vehicle sales. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The bottom line was also helped by one-off gains related to a change in the way it holds foreign-currency-denominated assets, the company said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  For the fiscal year ending March, Toyota expects net profit to decline 8.6% to Y4.520 trillion and revenue to increase 4.2% to Y47.000 trillion.

These statements may also relate to our future prospects, expectations, developments, and business strategies. Examples of such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the capital cost of our projects and the timing of project milestones; our ability to obtain financing to meet the funding requirements of our capital investment programme, as well as to fund our ongoing business activities and to pay dividends; statements regarding our future results of operations and financial condition, and regarding future economic performance including cost containment, cash conservation programmes and business optimisation initiatives; recent and proposed accounting pronouncements and their impact on our future results of operations and financial condition; our business strategy, performance outlook, plans, objectives or goals; statements regarding future competition, volume growth and changes in market share in the industries and markets for our products; our existing or anticipated investments, acquisitions of new businesses or the disposal of existing businesses, including estimates or projection of internal rates of return and future profitability; our estimated oil, gas and coal reserves; the probable future outcome of litigation, legislative, regulatory and fiscal developments, including statements regarding our ability to comply with future laws and regulations; future fluctuations in refining margins and crude oil, natural gas and petroleum and chemical product prices; the demand, pricing and cyclicality of oil, gas and petrochemical product prices; changes in the fuel and gas pricing mechanisms in <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">South Africa</span> and their effects on prices, our operating results and profitability; statements regarding future fluctuations in exchange and interest rates and changes in credit ratings; total shareholder return; our current or future products and anticipated customer demand for these products; assumptions relating to macroeconomics; climate change impacts and our climate change strategies, our development of sustainability within our businesses, our energy efficiency improvement, carbon and greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, our net zero carbon emissions ambition and future low-carbon initiatives, including relating to green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel; our estimated carbon tax liability; cyber security; and statements of assumptions underlying such statements. Words such as \"believe\", \"anticipate\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"seek\", \"will\", \"plan\", \"could\", \"may\", \"endeavour\", \"target\", \"forecast\" and \"project\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. By their very nature, forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, and there are risks that the predictions, forecasts, projections, and other forward-looking statements will not be achieved. If one or more of these risks materialise, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated. You should understand that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the plans, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions expressed in such forward-looking statements. These factors and others are discussed more fully in our most recent annual report on Form 20-F filed on <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">6 September 2024</span> and in other filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The list of factors discussed therein is not exhaustive; when relying on forward-looking statements to make investment decisions, you should carefully consider foregoing factors and other uncertainties and events, and you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements apply only as of the date on which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of them, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"> </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-91967a64=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-91967a64=\"\"><source sizes=\"(max-width: 768w)\" srcset=\"https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=IO12265&amp;sd=2025-02-05 1x,https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=IO12265&amp;sd=2025-02-05 2x,https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=IO12265&amp;sd=2025-02-05 3x\"><source sizes=\"(max-width: 1092w)\" srcset=\"https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=IO12265&amp;sd=2025-02-05 1x,https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=IO12265&amp;sd=2025-02-05 2x,https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=IO12265&amp;sd=2025-02-05 3x\"><source sizes=\"(max-width: 600w)\" srcset=\"https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=IO12265&amp;sd=2025-02-05 1x,https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=IO12265&amp;sd=2025-02-05 2x,https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=IO12265&amp;sd=2025-02-05 3x\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=IO12265&amp;sd=2025-02-05\"/></source></source></source></picture></span> View original content:<a class=\"mdc-link mds-link mdc-link--body\" data-v-4234e9e2=\"\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sasol-limited-trading-statement-for-the-six-months-ended-31-december-2024-302368590.html\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sasol-limited-trading-statement-for-the-six-months-ended-31-december-2024-302368590.html</a></p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">SOURCE  Sasol Limited</p>\n</span>\n</div>",
