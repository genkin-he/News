The tranche will end no later than 2 April 2025.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Equinor announces a share buy-back programme of up to USD 5 billion for 2025, including shares to be redeemed from the Norwegian State, in order to conclude the two-year programme for 2024 – 2025, announced in February 2024. The share buy-back programme for 2025 will be subject to market outlook and balance sheet strength and be structured into tranches where Equinor will buy back shares for a certain value in USD over a defined period. For the first tranche in 2025, Equinor will be entering into a non-discretionary agreement with a third party who will execute repurchases of shares and make its trading decisions independently of the company.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Commencement of new share buy-back tranches after the first tranche in 2025 will be decided by the board of directors on a quarterly basis in line with the company's dividend policy, and will be subject to board authorisations for share buy-back from the company's annual general meeting and agreement with the Norwegian State regarding share buy-back (as further described below).</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">The purpose of the share buy-back programme is to reduce the issued share capital of the company. All shares purchased as part of the first tranche for 2025 will thus be cancelled through a capital reduction at the annual general meeting of the company in May 2025.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Further information about the share buy-back programme and the first tranche:</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">The first tranche of the share buy-back programme for 2025 is based on an authorisation granted to the board of directors at the annual general meeting of the company held on 14 May 2024. According to this authorisation, the maximum number of shares to be purchased in the market is 92 million of which 30,843,973 remain available per commencement of the first tranche in 2025 (taken into account buy-backs made under previous tranches). The minimum price that can be paid per share is NOK 50, and the maximum price is NOK 1,000. The authorisation is valid until the earliest of 30 June 2025 and the annual general meeting of the company in 2025.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">An agreement between Equinor and the Norwegian State regulates the State's participation in the share buy-back: at the annual general meeting of the company in May 2025, the State will, as per proposal by the board of directors, vote for the cancellation of shares purchased in the market pursuant to the board authorisation, and the redemption and cancellation of a proportionate number of its shares in order to maintain its ownership share in the company at 67%. The price to be paid to the State for redemption of the State's shares shall be the volume-weighted average of the price paid by Equinor for shares purchased in the market plus an interest rate compensation, adjusted for any dividends paid.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">In the first tranche in 2025, shares will be purchased on the Oslo Stock Exchange and possibly other trading venues within the EEA. Transactions will be conducted in accordance with applicable safe harbour conditions, and as further set out in the Norwegian Securities Trading Act of 2007, EU Commission Regulation (EC) No 2016/1052 and the Oslo Stock Exchange's Guidelines for buy-back programmes and price stabilisation from February 2021.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">The board of directors will propose to the annual general meeting in the company to be held in May 2025, to cancel shares purchased in the market in this first tranche in 2025 and to redeem and cancel a proportionate number of the State's shares per the agreement with the State. Based on renewal of this agreement, shares purchased under subsequent tranches of the share buy-back programme for 2025 and a proportionate number of the State's shares will follow a similar process at the annual general meeting of the company in 2026.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">This is information that

Along with this growing investment comes the growing need to prove ROI and show results based on marketing campaigns. With user behavior on social platforms continuing to shift, teams need data to inform decisions about what platforms to prioritize and create strategies for,” said Alexandra Bjertnæs, Chief Strategy Officer at Meltwater.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Toby Southgate, global group CEO at We Are Social said: “Social is where brands can win or lose - it’s central to brand discovery, consumer engagement, and commerce. At the same time, AI is revolutionising how we search, create, and interact, while influencers continue to shape content trends and consumer behaviours. The opportunities for marketers to drive meaningful engagement have never been broader, but the complexity of digital and social media - evident in our 630+ page report - means there’s no single route to success. To create effective work, brands need to understand the cultural nuances of the online world, and create ideas worth talking about.
