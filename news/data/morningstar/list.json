And that looks set to continue, with China now jumping into the tariff fray, and equities looking weaker for Tuesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     That's as we're still in the belly of earnings season, with results from a big Nvidia competitor looming after the close. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Stepping away from the headlines that make the market these days, our call of the day from Bank of America flags a contrarian stock market indicator that they say is just a whisker away from a \"sell signal.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     BofA's sell side indicator, tracks average recommended equity allocations by Wall Street strategists. In January, that it climbed to 57%, the highest since early 2022 and a mere 1 percentage point shy from a sell signal, Savita Subramanian, equity and quant strategist, and her colleague Victoria Roloff, told clients in a note. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     In other words, when so many strategists are saying buy stocks, the best plan of action may be to not follow the herd. When the indicator has been at the 57% level or higher, returns for the next 12 months were positive  65% of the time versus 82% overall, BofA said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     So the bank's voicing caution in a crowded market, as they put it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"The [sell-side indicator] has been a reliable contrarian indicator. In other words, it has been bullish when Wall Street was extremely bearish and vice versa,\" and now sits at the closest to a sell signal since December 2021, said Subramanian and Roloff. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Last month, those strategists left their equity allocations unchanged after a 2.8% gain for the S&amp;P 500 SPX in December, which suggests a wait-and-see approach on trade tensions and any policy risks, said the BofA team. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"The current level of 57% implies an estimated price return of 10.5% over the [next twelve months], lower than the past two years but still healthy. We see this as support for our view that 2025 is a year for buying stocks, not the index,\" they said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Societe Generale has predicted 2025 will be the best stock picking period in 25 years, citing reflationary policies from President Trump's administration, such as lower taxes, less regulation and lower oil prices, which they say can all yield potential stock picking ideas. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Plus: Stock market's wild ride on Monday could be a microcosm of what to expect in 2025 </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The markets </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     U.S. stock-index futures (ES00) (YM00) (NQ00) are lower, while Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y BX:TMUBMUSD02Y are rising, and the ICE Dollar Index dollar DXY is down 0.4%.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Quentin Fottrell </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     'I've been in the nonprofit world my entire career, so my 403(b) is less than $500,000' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Dear Quentin, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The direction the U.S. economy is headed is frightening for someone with only 14 years before retirement, especially with my job being grant-funded. I'm in my 50s and concerned about interest rates, tariffs, inflation and the general performance of the economy and markets. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     I've been in the nonprofit world my entire career, so my 403(b) is less than $500,000. I contribute 14% to my retirement and my employer matches 6%.  I check my account every three months or so, or more, and I'm not always happy with what I see. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     My husband has a solid job with decent retirement. We have sensible car payments, our home is about half paid off and we have no other debt. Second jobs are not an option, as we both work a huge number of unpredictable hours. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     I'm worried there won't be time to regrow after any tank in the markets, especially after the Federal Reserve's latest statement, which I am still trying to make sense of. How do I shield my retirement savings from the current economic forecast? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Fiftysomething Worker </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Related: 'My retirement is going to be a disaster': I'm 59 and have $45,000 in my 401(k). I earn $72,000. Am I doomed? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Dear Fiftysomething, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Fourteen years is a long time in politics and the stock market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     For every registered Democratic voter there is another registered Republican who feels great optimism about the next four years. While never the twain shall meet, it illustrates the importance of perspective and perils of subjectivity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     More importantly for you, 14 years is a long time before you retire. A lot will happen between now and then, but your 14% contribution to your 403(b) and 6% match will stand to you over the next decade and a half. As you pass 50, start allocating more to bonds than stocks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     You're writing at a dramatic time for U.S. stocks. China's DeepSeek's apparent ability to produce AI capabilities at a fraction of the cost of U.S. companies rattled Silicon Valley. And now the U.S. faces a trade war, which risks hurting demand for goods and, therefore, growth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Focus on what you can control: Your job, your 403(b) contributions and employer match, your modest car payments and paying off any credit-card debt you may incur every month, and slowly - but surely - paying off your mortgage. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     So, if in 14 years, you have $800,000 or $1 million in your retirement account rather than $500,000, it will be a bonus to the modest lifestyle that has gotten you where you want to be so you can move to a lighter work schedule or, indeed, not work at all. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Stay the course and don't catastrophize. Focus on your job, your 403(b) contributions and employer match, and staying free of credit-card debt. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     But nor do I want to gaslight you with platitudes. Tariffs - and, in particular, a trade war - can have severe implications for the price of goods, consumer demand and, as a result, economic growth. They can lead businesses to cut investment and, as you say, dampen economic growth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     On Monday, President Trump agreed to pause his tariffs on Mexico and Canada. The tariffs, which originally went into effect on Feb. 1, included levies of 25% on imports from Canada, 10% on energy products from Canada, and a10% tariff on imports from China. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Markets are - for the most part - hoping that Trump is using such threats as a negotiating ploy with two of the U.S.'s closest neighbors, and China. Trump said he's speaking with Canadian and Mexican leaders on Tuesday. These countries are, after all, the top three purchasers of U.S. goods. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Writing on the social-media site Truth Social on Sunday, Trump acknowledged that tariffs could result in \"some pain,\" but said it is the \"price that must be paid.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, S&amp;P 500 SPX and Nasdaq COMP all ended lower on Monday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     He may not be wrong. This peer-reviewed study by a group of international economists, looking at 151 countries between 1963-2014, found that tariff increases are associated with \"an economically and statistically sizable and persistent decline in output growth.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Markets are - for the most part - hoping that Trump is using tariff threats as a negotiating ploy with Mexico and Canada, two of the U.S.'s closest neighbors, and China. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Fed officials are not playwrights. In fact, they are often trying to avoid giving us a clear message we can take home and parse apart over the coming weeks and months. In times of change, it often behooves them to be less committal, as understandably frustrating as that is for you. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Economists and the Federal Reserve are trying, perhaps in vain, to predict the impact of tariffs, looser financial regulation and tougher immigration policies on the economy and consumers. Stay the course and don't catastrophize. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Last week, the Fed left the benchmark interest rate unchanged after three consecutive rate reductions in 2024, which reduced rates by one percentage point. As for making major changes: If in doubt, leave them out. We can all benefit from that logic. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     In January's press conference, as a recent example, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell used the word \"uncertainty,\" or a variation of that word, more than a dozen times. Without uncertainty, there is no future. It's a package deal, I'm afraid. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Fed statements can tend to be frustratingly vague and repetitive, which might give you some reassurance in that as much as everything changes, things also stay the same. Fed officials don't always see crises coming, even when they've technically already arrived. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Not everyone will be impacted in the same way by world events. The U.S. is a kaleidoscope of consumers who have different levels of vulnerability and job security. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The Fed, in its most recent statement, said, \"The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     OK, good luck interpreting that in a way that gives you the answer that you need. In the meantime, know that the stock market (and your retirement) will likely continue to rise over the long term. If you are freaking out over three-month returns, you will have a rough 14 years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a nonprofit research organization, in a recent note, said that inflation will take roughly two years to return to the Fed's 2% target rate. \"Economic forecasts even one year or two years out are highly uncertain,\" it said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     But it struck an upbeat tone. \"Broadly speaking, the data indicate that the U.S. economy in the later part of 2024 was in a strong position,\" it added. What's more, it said that \"employment levels were at near-historic highs, and real wage and income growth was positive.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"The incoming Trump administration is taking the helm of a U.S. economy largely on solid footing,\" it concluded. \"The evolution of the U.S. economy over the next several years, therefore, should be measured against this extraordinary starting point.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Fed statements can be frustratingly vague and repetitive, which might give you some reassurance: as much as everything changes, they stay the same. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Former President Joe Biden has left a pretty solid economy for Trump by most measures: Inflation has finally cooled, for now, with the consumer-price index currently running below 3%. Unemployment reached 4.1% in December. For now, the markets will focus on the tariff turmoil. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Gross domestic product growth in the second quarter outperformed many economists' more pessimistic expectations due to persistently high interest rates and worries about the cost of living on everything from eggs to property. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Not everyone will be impacted in the same way by world events. The U.S. is a kaleidoscope of consumers who have different levels of vulnerability and job security. Debt is one area where you are strong. Keeping debts low is the best way to navigate uncertainty. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Your retirement savings are in good shape, for the most part. The average 401(k) balance for someone aged 50 to 54 is $201,400 and $246,800 for those aged 55 to 59, according to Fidelity, so assume that the median balance is even lower than that. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     If Jerome Powell is not able to accurately predict the direction of the U.S. economy over the next six months, one year or even four years, how are you supposed to know any better? Take statements from those who do say they know with at least a pinch of salt. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Related: Will Trump's policies lead to a recession?
