Users of these smartphone-compatible diabetes devices can configure alert settings, such as which alerts to receive, how often and how the alerts are delivered (e.g. audible, vibration, text only) through the app on their phone.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">The FDA has received medical device reports in which users report these alerts are not being delivered or not being heard, in cases where the users thought they had configured the alerts to be delivered. In some cases, missing these alerts may have contributed to serious harm, including severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), severe hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), diabetic ketoacidosis (when the body does not have enough insulin to use blood sugar for energy) and death.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">\"Modern medical devices, such as diabetes devices that connect to a smartphone, can provide users with the convenience and flexibility to configure alerts that are personalized to them.

            "title": "Chinese Retailer Stocks Fall After USPS Pauses, Then Resumes Shipping",
            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Katherine Hamilton </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Shares of Chinese online retail companies pared back losses after the U.S. Postal Service said it would resume accepting packages from China and Hong Kong--a reversal from its announcement the previous night that it would stop accepting such packages--though the stocks remained down amid continued uncertainty about the effect of tariffs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Chinese online marketplace Alibaba saw its New York-traded American depositary receipts fall as low as $99.69, a 2.6% drop from market close on Tuesday, but they recovered some of their loss Wednesday morning. New York-traded ADRs of PDD, which owns budget e-retailer Temu, dipped as much as 4.6% to $108.83 after market close, and were still recently down 3%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The stocks have had a week of ups and downs as the Trump administration's 10% tariffs on Chinese imports threaten to upend their distribution of low-cost products to U.S. customers. The USPS said Wednesday morning it is working with Customs and Border Protection to establish an efficient way to collect the new tariffs while limiting distribution to package delivery. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Some U.S.-based companies that rely on cheap shipping from China also reacted. Amazon's stock fell as much as 2.7% from Tuesday's closing price. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  As part of the tariffs, Trump also closed a trade loophole that has helped many Chinese retailers keep prices low for U.S. customers. The loophole, called de minimis, allows exports under $800 to enter the U.S. without duties, and has been crucial savings for e-commerce companies selling cheap clothing, electronics and furniture from China. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Nearly 1.4 billion shipments in 2024 claimed the de minimis exemption, a more-than-sixfold increase from a decade ago, Customs and Border Protection said in January. The cost savings of de minimis has helped companies like Temu offer prices 20% to 40% lower than U.S. competitors and make an estimated $20 billion in 2024, KeyBanc analyst Brad Thomas told The Wall Street Journal. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Write to Katherine Hamilton at katherine.hamilton@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  February 05, 2025 11:19 ET (16:19 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Alphabet has been talking nonstop about AI. Now investors are looking for the proof that the company's efforts are working. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Alphabet Inc. has become an artificial-intelligence stock, for better or for worse. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Though advertising still makes up the lion's share of the company's revenue, investors have been focusing more on the part of Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) business that seems the best proxy for AI momentum. That's Google's cloud unit, which came up short in the latest quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     See more: Alphabet's stock slides in the wake of a revenue miss and huge AI spending target </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"If Google wants to be viewed and treated like an AI winner, we need some quantified KPI,\" or key performance indicator, Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik wrote following Alphabet's latest report. While Alphabet grew cloud revenue by 30% in the latest quarter, that was a sharper slowdown than analysts were expecting, he noted. Growth was 35% in the third quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Cloud growth captures the progress Alphabet is making as it works to win market share against Amazon.com Inc.'s (AMZN) Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) Azure. The miss on cloud revenue suggests Alphabet is moving more slowly than anticipated as it tries to make inroads against its larger competitors, according to Shmulik. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"Owning the distant third player in Cloud on the hopes they grab market share on the strength of their AI capabilities is a tough call to make,\" wrote Shmulik, who has a market-perform rating on the stock. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Alphabet's stock is down 8.4% in morning trading Wednesday, putting the company on track to shed $200 billion in market capitalization if the losses carry through to the close, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That would be the company's largest-ever one-day decline in market cap. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Another issue for Alphabet is that investors are scrutinizing the company's high capital spending, particularly in light of supply constraints in the cloud business and search performance that merely met expectations. Alphabet said it expects $75 billion in capital expenditures for the year, whereas analysts had been expecting about $59 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"With that in mind, it is still unclear to us whether Google will be able to extract increased monetization from AI?Overviews\" relative to traditional search-engine results pages, \"or how quickly supply constraints in [the Google Cloud Platform] will be alleviated, so for the time being we alongside investors will need to wait for sharper product development/release signals to materialize,\" UBS analyst Stephen Ju wrote. He has a neutral rating on the stock. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     It's also worth noting that not all AI stocks are treated equally. Meta Platforms Inc. (META) seems to have proven itself more in the eyes of investors, given that its stock actually rose in the face of a higher-than-expected spending forecast. And while Alphabet's stock is trading at a forward price-to-earnings multiple that's roughly in line with its five-year average, Meta's is trading at a premium to its own. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Read: Zuckerberg wants to spend billions more on AI. Meta investors like that idea. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"Shipping products and proving that they will indeed provide incremental multi-year revenue and cash flow growth remains the proof point that [Alphabet] needs to show,\" Morgan Stanley's Brian Nowak wrote. Nowak maintained an overweight rating. In the meantime, Alphabet will likely be looking over its shoulder as Meta has big ambitions to disrupt the search experience for consumers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
