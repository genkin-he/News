            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Therese Poletti </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     In its earnings report Tuesday, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. did not break out a specific revenue number or forecast for its AI chips, as it had in recent quarters, a move that is bothering investors. History could prove that their concerns are valid. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Shares of AMD (AMD) fell 9% in after-hours trading, even though a few analysts had recently predicted the chip maker would stop providing guidance for its MI300 family of AI-focused graphics chips. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     When asked about the lack of specific guidance on the company's call with analysts, AMD Chief Executive Lisa Su was a bit disingenuous. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"I think what we look at is, certainly for the first year of the data center, GPU business,\" Su said. \"We wanted to give some clear progression as it was going - the business is now at scale, actually now at over $5 billion. And as we go into 2025, I think our guidance will be more at the segment level, with some color as to what's going on between the two businesses.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     In the previous quarter, AMD raised its 2024 guidance for AI graphics-chip revenue to exceeding $5 billion, up from a previous estimate of over $4.5 billion. But in its fourth-quarter results reported Tuesday, AMD's total data-center business - which includes AI graphics chips - had just $3.9 billion in revenue, missing Wall Street's expectations of $4.1 billion. That was still up 69% year over year, while total 2024 revenue was $12.6 billion. Company executives said both the data-center business and sales of AI GPUs should grow by strong double-digit percentages in 2025. But they were not more specific. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"AMD may be in a bit of a box, as we don't think the likely AI trajectory into 2025 can really support a solid guide, but the lack of a guide (the more likely scenario in our opinion) will also be taken negatively,\" said Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon, in a note to clients last week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     AMD is transitioning to its next-generation AI GPUs. Rasgon noted that while the upcoming chips - AMD's MI325 and MI350 - appear to be competitive with Nvidia Corp.'s (NVDA) products, they are well behind timing-wise. Su said Tuesday that AMD would speed up the launch of the MI350 to the middle of this year, instead of a launching in the second half of 2025, an incremental positive. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Shares of AMD are down about 26% from last quarter, after reaching a high in 2024 of around $227, as investors got over-exuberant about the company's AI chips and expectations got too frothy. At one point, some bullish analysts had AI GPU revenue alone as high as $8 billion in 2024. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     It's worth pointing out one noteworthy example of a company that also stopped giving Wall Street a key earnings figure: Apple Inc. (AAPL) decided in 2018 to stop disclosing product unit sales, which it did right as iPhones were flattening from their once-torrid growth. It was the beginning of much slower growth for the iPhone. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     From 2018: When the going gets tough, Apple hides its numbers </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Granted, AMD does not have a long history of breaking out revenue for its AI GPU chips, or any other individual product lines. AMD, like many other chip and hardware companies, got caught up in the AI hype last year, and began breaking out its AI-specific revenue. But Wall Street does not like it when any metrics are suddenly taken away. And AMD is now paying the price, as the most optimistic of investors try to readjust their expectations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Therese Poletti </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Brett Arends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Hard pass on this idea </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     President Donald Trump's proposal to create a multi-trillion-dollar U.S. sovereign-wealth fund, run by the government, isn't a bad idea. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     It's a full bingo card of bad ideas. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Where even to begin with this? Trump claims his fund would \"lessen the burden of taxes on American families and small businesses,\" but the opposite is true. This fund will increase the tax burden on the country, because it will be financed with taxpayers' dollars. That will be our money. And Trump has said it could be as much as $2 trillion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This isn't a tax cut, it's a tax hike. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     And what is this fund for? Trump said it would be \"to invest in great national endeavors for the benefit of all of the American people.\" This sounds like the famous scam during the South Sea Bubble 300 years ago, when a huckster gulled investors to buy stock in \"a company for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Good luck with that. \"Were not the fact stated by scores of credible witnesses,\" historian Charles Mackay later wrote, \"it would be impossible to believe that any person could have been duped by such a project.\" But duped they were. It showed, Mackay added, \"the utter madness of the people.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     It is no coincidence that most of the leading sovereign-wealth funds around the world are run by corrupt oligarchies, mostly in the Middle East and Asia, riddled with cronyism of the worst kind. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, Norway runs its own sovereign-wealth fund pretty much as an index fund to minimize the risks of cronyism and corruption. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The idea of creating an American fund raises a long list of unanswerable questions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Why, for example, would anyone think money would be invested more successfully by people in Washington than it would by private investors or fund managers? Why would they think such a fund would add any value? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Consider: Fund analyst company Morningstar lists about 350 U.S. mutual funds of significant size that have been around for at least 20 years. Of those, just eight seem to have outperformed a simple S&amp;P 500 SPX index fund over that period. That would be about 2%, give or take. (This doesn't even count the many funds that did so badly they closed, and dropped out of the screening.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     So what are the odds that political appointees in Washington will do so? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This is the point where I have to remind you that this is supposed to be a Republican administration. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Trump suggested Monday that this fund could use taxpayers' money to buy TikTok. No, I'm not kidding. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, there's another problem. Many of the countries that have created sovereign-wealth funds, most notably oil-rich Norway, have done so in order to handle their government surpluses. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     America doesn't have government surpluses. It has deficits. Massive, massive deficits, stretching as far into the distance as the Congressional Budget Office's eye can see. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The CBO reckons that U.S. national debt, already $29 trillion, is going to skyrocket to $52 trillion in just 10 years' time. That would be 118% of gross domestic product, an all-time high. Oh, and that's not even counting the effect of extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts, which would add an estimated $4.6 trillion to the debt. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     And this doesn't even include the tens of trillions of dollars that taxpayers are going to have to find to support Social Security and Medicare. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     If somehow the government is able to get hold of $2 trillion, they should be putting it toward the debt. Watching a bankrupt Uncle Sam get suckered into gambling his last nickels on a venture sold to him by a guy in a shiny tie from New York City sounds like something straight out of Mark Twain or O. Henry. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Hard pass. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Brett Arends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

It is a Layer 1 network that is both EVM-compatible and powered by a unique Proof of Liquidity (PoL) consensus mechanism. With this mechanism, validators not only stake tokens but also provide liquidity. Through its Proof of Liquidity (PoL) model, Berachain leverages active liquidity providers to secure the network, effectively turning capital into a core security resource.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">This groundbreaking approach has attracted significant financial backing, with the project raising $142 million in its latest funding round. As of January 2, the Berachain official website reports that 234 protocols are actively participating in its bArtio Testnet. BERA is a gas token, used for transactions and staking within its ecosystem.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Berachain, powered by the BeaconKit modular consensus layer and built on the Cosmos SDK, offers flexibility for Ethereum-based blockchains. It enables developers to create both Layer-1 and Layer-2 solutions without needing to rewrite programming languages. Recently, Berachain launched Boyco, a pre-launch liquidity platform in collaboration with Enso and LayerZero, designed to address the cold start issue for new decentralized applications. Boyco's pre-deposit vaults have already reached $2.2 billion.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Celebrate the BERA Launch with a prize pool of 19,100 BERA &amp; 50,000 USDT<br data-v-43363f62=\"\"/></strong>In a significant show of support for Berachain and its expansive ecosystem, MEXC is set to list the new BERA token.
