Revenue rose 2.9% to Y12.391 trillion despite lower vehicle sales. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The bottom line was also helped by one-off gains related to a change in the way it holds foreign-currency-denominated assets, the company said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  For the fiscal year ending March, Toyota expects net profit to decline 8.6% to Y4.520 trillion and revenue to increase 4.2% to Y47.000 trillion.
