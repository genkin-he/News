            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Cam Hui </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Stock market 'vigilantes' will force the Trump administration to do a face-saving backtrack </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Uncertainty over global economic policy has spiked. In just the past week, stock investors were given a fright over changes to the AI ecosystem, the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank interest-rate decisions, earnings reports from the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies including Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT)and Tesla(TSLA), along with a raft of Trump administration policy announcements and executive orders that surprised the market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Is it any wonder that market volatility has arrived? As a consequence, it's a tough time for trend followers because apparent established trends can quickly reverse themselves in this environment. As an example, the relative returns of price-momentum ETFs, which seek exposure to stocks that have gone up the most in the recent past, have been on a roller-coaster ride. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The Trump administration's rookie mistakes in policy implementation aren't helping either. As an example, the Executive Order (EO) on the federal aid freeze had to be reversed, much in the way the travel ban had to be reversed when Trump took office for the first time in 2017. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The Trump team drafted this newest EO without consulting the agencies involved, for reasons of secrecy. The result was an order that was badly written, unclear in its objectives and lacked guidance to agencies in implementation and the specifics of different cases. As a consequence, it had to be withdrawn. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Consider the implementation difficulties of another of Trump's initiatives: the denial of birthright citizenship to people born in the U.S. to noncitizen parents. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Even if it were to survive a constitutional challenge, how does an American born in the U.S. prove citizenship? The conventional method of a birth certificate wouldn't work anymore. You would need your parents' birth certificates or naturalization papers - who has those kinds of records? What if you were born to a single mother and the father is unknown? Even if the government determined that someone is not entitled to citizenship under those provisions, that person could potentially become stateless. Where would you deport someone like that? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Slowdowns in Canada and Mexico would crater U.S. growth outlook expectations and probably plunge the U.S. economy into recession as well. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     As for the announced tariffs of 25% on Canada and Mexico, it's most likely they were imposed to virtue signal and are likely to be reversed in the near future - as their costs are too high for all parties involved. It's unclear what Trump is trying to accomplish with the tariffs on Canada and Mexico. An analysis of trade deficits shows that the lion's share of the trade deficits are attributable to China and Asia - not Canada and Mexico. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The reason for the tariffs was the amount of the drug fentanyl crossing U.S. borders. While the amount of fentanyl seized at the Mexican border is considerable, the amount seized at the Canadian border in 2024 was just 43 pounds. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     A recent Bank of Canada study modeled the effects of a 25% tariff on Canada and projected a -6% growth effect on GDP, which amounts to a deep recession. Trade within the U.S., Mexico and Canada bloc in 2020 accounted for 29% of Canadian GDP, 40% of Mexican GDP and 10% of U.S. GDP. Undoubtedly the recessionary effects of a 25% tariff on Mexican goods would be the same order of magnitude or worse. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Slowdowns of that magnitude in Canada and Mexico would crater U.S. growth outlook expectations and probably plunge the U.S. economy into recession as well, which is an outcome that Trump is unlikely to want to risk if his intention is to virtue signal. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper reported on a different study by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce's Business Data Lab which estimated Canadian GDP would fall 2.6% and U.S. GDP 1.6%, which would be recessionary. In addition, many U.S. companies with cross-border supply chains will be affected, resulting in significant U.S. job losses. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Trust the 'Trump put' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Expect the stock market \"vigilantes\" to force the Trump administration to do a face-saving backtrack in the near future. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The current market environment suggests that traders should adopt a strategy of \"buy the dip and sell the rips.\" The combination of negative surprises during earnings season and potential bearish policy announcements when the market is overbought will put downward pressure on stock prices. On the other hand, investors should trust the stock market vigilantes to activate the \"Trump Put\" in the event of a market downdraft, as the U.S. president is said to judge his own performance by the U.S. stock market. In the absence of a severe bearish catalyst, expect stock prices to bounce when the market becomes oversold. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     So where does that leave investors now? The S&amp;P 500 SPX is near overbought. Investor sentiment, as measured by put/call ratio, is showing signs of froth, which argues for light bearish positioning for trading accounts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     As well, the relative volume of the Nasdaq Composite COMP to the NYSE is turning down, which is often a sign of impending weakness in the Nasdaq 100 NDX. The key question for traders is whether the S&amp;P 500 can hold up if the Magnificent Seven falters. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Finally, the Citi Panic/Euphoria Model is off-the-charts euphoric, though it's not very predictive of equity returns of time horizons of less than a year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Accordingly, traders should adopt a strategy of \"buy the dip and sell the rips.\" Lighten or short positions when the market is overbought. On the other hand, investors should trust the stock market vigilantes to activate the Trump Put in the event of a market downturn. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Cam Hui writes the investment blog Humble Student of the Markets, where this article first appeared.

The company also guided for fiscal-year revenue growth of 31%, which was well ahead of consensus expectations of mid-20% growth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"Surprising to us was the strength of the 2025 outlook, despite the tough compares next year particularly in the government business.

I'm in my 50s and concerned about interest rates, tariffs, inflation and the general performance of the economy and markets. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     I've been in the nonprofit world my entire career, so my 403(b) is less than $500,000. I contribute 14% to my retirement and my employer matches 6%.  I check my account every three months or so, or more, and I'm not always happy with what I see. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     My husband has a solid job with decent retirement. We have sensible car payments, our home is about half paid off and we have no other debt. Second jobs are not an option, as we both work a huge number of unpredictable hours. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     I'm worried there won't be time to regrow after any tank in the markets, especially after the Federal Reserve's latest statement, which I am still trying to make sense of. How do I shield my retirement savings from the current economic forecast? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Fiftysomething Worker </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Related: 'My retirement is going to be a disaster': I'm 59 and have $45,000 in my 401(k). I earn $72,000. Am I doomed? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Dear Fiftysomething, </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Fourteen years is a long time in politics and the stock market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     For every registered Democratic voter there is another registered Republican who feels great optimism about the next four years. While never the twain shall meet, it illustrates the importance of perspective and perils of subjectivity. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     More importantly for you, 14 years is a long time before you retire. A lot will happen between now and then, but your 14% contribution to your 403(b) and 6% match will stand to you over the next decade and a half. As you pass 50, start allocating more to bonds than stocks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     You're writing at a dramatic time for U.S. stocks. China's DeepSeek's apparent ability to produce AI capabilities at a fraction of the cost of U.S. companies rattled Silicon Valley. And now the U.S. faces a trade war, which risks hurting demand for goods and, therefore, growth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Focus on what you can control: Your job, your 403(b) contributions and employer match, your modest car payments and paying off any credit-card debt you may incur every month, and slowly - but surely - paying off your mortgage. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     So, if in 14 years, you have $800,000 or $1 million in your retirement account rather than $500,000, it will be a bonus to the modest lifestyle that has gotten you where you want to be so you can move to a lighter work schedule or, indeed, not work at all. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Stay the course and don't catastrophize. Focus on your job, your 403(b) contributions and employer match, and staying free of credit-card debt. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     But nor do I want to gaslight you with platitudes. Tariffs - and, in particular, a trade war - can have severe implications for the price of goods, consumer demand and, as a result, economic growth. They can lead businesses to cut investment and, as you say, dampen economic growth. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     On Monday, President Trump agreed to pause his tariffs on Mexico and Canada. The tariffs, which originally went into effect on Feb. 1, included levies of 25% on imports from Canada, 10% on energy products from Canada, and a10% tariff on imports from China. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Markets are - for the most part - hoping that Trump is using such threats as a negotiating ploy with two of the U.S.'s closest neighbors, and China. Trump said he's speaking with Canadian and Mexican leaders on Tuesday. These countries are, after all, the top three purchasers of U.S. goods. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Writing on the social-media site Truth Social on Sunday, Trump acknowledged that tariffs could result in \"some pain,\" but said it is the \"price that must be paid.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, S&amp;P 500 SPX and Nasdaq COMP all ended lower on Monday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     He may not be wrong. This peer-reviewed study by a group of international economists, looking at 151 countries between 1963-2014, found that tariff increases are associated with \"an economically and statistically sizable and persistent decline in output growth.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Markets are - for the most part - hoping that Trump is using tariff threats as a negotiating ploy with Mexico and Canada, two of the U.S.'s closest neighbors, and China. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Fed officials are not playwrights. In fact, they are often trying to avoid giving us a clear message we can take home and parse apart over the coming weeks and months. In times of change, it often behooves them to be less committal, as understandably frustrating as that is for you. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Economists and the Federal Reserve are trying, perhaps in vain, to predict the impact of tariffs, looser financial regulation and tougher immigration policies on the economy and consumers. Stay the course and don't catastrophize. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Last week, the Fed left the benchmark interest rate unchanged after three consecutive rate reductions in 2024, which reduced rates by one percentage point. As for making major changes: If in doubt, leave them out. We can all benefit from that logic. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     In January's press conference, as a recent example, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell used the word \"uncertainty,\" or a variation of that word, more than a dozen times. Without uncertainty, there is no future. It's a package deal, I'm afraid. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Fed statements can tend to be frustratingly vague and repetitive, which might give you some reassurance in that as much as everything changes, things also stay the same. Fed officials don't always see crises coming, even when they've technically already arrived. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Not everyone will be impacted in the same way by world events. The U.S. is a kaleidoscope of consumers who have different levels of vulnerability and job security. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The Fed, in its most recent statement, said, \"The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     OK, good luck interpreting that in a way that gives you the answer that you need. In the meantime, know that the stock market (and your retirement) will likely continue to rise over the long term. If you are freaking out over three-month returns, you will have a rough 14 years. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a nonprofit research organization, in a recent note, said that inflation will take roughly two years to return to the Fed's 2% target rate. \"Economic forecasts even one year or two years out are highly uncertain,\" it said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     But it struck an upbeat tone. \"Broadly speaking, the data indicate that the U.S. economy in the later part of 2024 was in a strong position,\" it added. What's more, it said that \"employment levels were at near-historic highs, and real wage and income growth was positive.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"The incoming Trump administration is taking the helm of a U.S. economy largely on solid footing,\" it concluded. \"The evolution of the U.S. economy over the next several years, therefore, should be measured against this extraordinary starting point.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Fed statements can be frustratingly vague and repetitive, which might give you some reassurance: as much as everything changes, they stay the same. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Former President Joe Biden has left a pretty solid economy for Trump by most measures: Inflation has finally cooled, for now, with the consumer-price index currently running below 3%. Unemployment reached 4.1% in December. For now, the markets will focus on the tariff turmoil. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Gross domestic product growth in the second quarter outperformed many economists' more pessimistic expectations due to persistently high interest rates and worries about the cost of living on everything from eggs to property. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Not everyone will be impacted in the same way by world events. The U.S. is a kaleidoscope of consumers who have different levels of vulnerability and job security. Debt is one area where you are strong. Keeping debts low is the best way to navigate uncertainty. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Your retirement savings are in good shape, for the most part. The average 401(k) balance for someone aged 50 to 54 is $201,400 and $246,800 for those aged 55 to 59, according to Fidelity, so assume that the median balance is even lower than that. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     If Jerome Powell is not able to accurately predict the direction of the U.S. economy over the next six months, one year or even four years, how are you supposed to know any better? Take statements from those who do say they know with at least a pinch of salt. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Related: Will Trump's policies lead to a recession?

Her children had flown the nest and she was ready to move to a smaller abode, she explained. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"It's a beautiful, happy house,\" she told Mansion Global at the time. \"We had many, many fantastic years of fun and play and joy there.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Now, that opportunity to fill the house with joy will pass to its new owner, who closed on the property on Jan. 23, according to records. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Situated on a walled and gated lot in San Francisco's tony Sea Cliff neighborhood, the noteworthy property was built in 1926-a decade before the construction of architect Earle B. Bertz's landmark Golden Gate Bridge. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The sweeping views of the San Francisco Bay and the Marin Headlands are surely one of the main things that attracted the buyer-whose identity has not been revealed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The home sprawls across nearly 10,600 square feet and features many of the same architectural designs as it did when it was built in 1926, despite the former couple having raised their three children there. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"Marsha and Robin Williams took the house down to the studs and rebuilt it in the early '90s, updating all the major systems,\" listing agent Steven Mavromihalis told Realtor.com when the property first came on the market. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"However, they took great pains to preserve the rare and valuable building materials used in 1926, which are simply no longer available in the construction of modern homes.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     More from Realtor.com: Boomers Are Refusing To Give Their $84 Trillion in Real Estate and Wealth to Their Children </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The home has been maintained extremely well since the actor died. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The couple bought the home for $3.2 million in 1991.
