Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Derivatives Risk.</strong> Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Options Contracts.</strong> The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Distribution Risk.</strong> As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income.

Additionally, one in four surgeons anticipate that GLP-1 medications will drive a growing demand for non-surgical treatments, such as injectable fillers and skin tightening procedures, as patients seek less invasive options to manage these aesthetic changes.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">In response to the skyrocketing popularity of GLP-1 medications, 10 percent of AAFPRS members have started personally prescribing them—a figure that is anticipated to grow in the coming years.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">The Top Procedures of 2024<br data-v-43363f62=\"\"/></strong>Consistent with the past five years, rhinoplasties (commonly referred to as \"nose jobs\"), facelifts (including partial facelifts), and blepharoplasties (\"eye lifts\") remained the top three surgical procedures in 2024, with rhinoplasty continuing to be the most frequently requested surgery. Notably, about 80 percent of AAFPRS members report that more than 10 percent of patients seeking rhinoplasties are seeking revisions of previous surgeries.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Facelifts, a staple in facial rejuvenation, maintain their popularity with nearly 90 percent of AAFPRS members performing them each year. Of note, facelift patients are trending younger, with patients aged 35-55 rising from as low as 26 percent to as high as 32 percent in recent years. A total of 67 percent of facial plastic surgeons agree that the average age of facelift patients is likely to trend younger.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">However, minimally invasive procedures continue to dominate, favored for their ability to provide instant results with minimal downtime. These treatments account for 80 percent of the total number of treatments. Neurotoxins (like Botox) and dermal fillers remain the go-to treatments, with 90 percent of surgeons performing these procedures regularly.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Menopause Makeovers: The Rise of Facial Rejuvenation Treatments for Baby Boomers and Gen X Women<br data-v-43363f62=\"\"/></strong>Hormonal changes during menopause significantly impact the skin and facial structure, leading to thinner skin, sagging around the eyes, and weakened facial bones. These changes often result in drooping brows, looser eyelids, and the development of jowls. In response, more women are turning to both surgical and non-surgical treatments to combat the effects of menopause.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">A total of 28 percent of AAFPRS members agree that patients seeking treatments reference symptoms of perimenopause- and menopause-related concerns as a reason for consultation, highlighting a growing trend in facial rejuvenation during this transformative phase of life.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\"Soft tissue fillers, especially biostimulatory fillers, can help replace collagen stores from the inside out and outside in, which can be helpful for women experiencing a drop in collagen levels, leading to wrinkles and fine lines,\" says Dr. Byrne. \"The growing conversation around menopause and aesthetics marks a significant shift in how women approach this life stage, empowering them with the knowledge and resources to embrace and celebrate it with confidence.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">MAN-esthetics: A Growing Movement<br data-v-43363f62=\"\"/></strong>While women remain the primary demographic for plastic surgery, men are increasingly seeking cosmetic procedures, with 92 percent of AAFPRS surgeons reporting male patients in their practice, with blepharoplasty, rhinoplasty and facelifts being the most common surgeries. Notably, hair transplantation stands out as the only procedure where men significantly outnumber women, reflecting a strong desire to address hair loss and maintain a youthful appearance.<br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/><br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/>\"Non-surgical treatments continue to gain traction among men, especially neurotoxins like Botox, which are increasingly sought after by those striving to look refreshed, reduce signs of aging, and preserve a competitive advantage in both professional and social settings,\" observes Dr. Byrne. In fact, just like their female counterparts, neurotoxins, fillers and skin treatments remain the top three non-surgical procedures among men. This trend highlights the growing acceptance of aesthetic treatments among men and their changing approach to self-care.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Regenerative Medicine: The Future of Aesthetics</strong><br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/>One of the most exciting trends highlighted in the survey is the rise of regenerative medicine, with 57 percent of AAFPRS members forecasting it as a major area of innovation in the aesthetic field.

And that looks set to continue, with China now jumping into the tariff fray, and equities looking weaker for Tuesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     That's as we're still in the belly of earnings season, with results from a big Nvidia competitor looming after the close. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Stepping away from the headlines that make the market these days, our call of the day from Bank of America flags a contrarian stock market indicator that they say is just a whisker away from a \"sell signal.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     BofA's sell side indicator, tracks average recommended equity allocations by Wall Street strategists. In January, that it climbed to 57%, the highest since early 2022 and a mere 1 percentage point shy from a sell signal, Savita Subramanian, equity and quant strategist, and her colleague Victoria Roloff, told clients in a note. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     In other words, when so many strategists are saying buy stocks, the best plan of action may be to not follow the herd. When the indicator has been at the 57% level or higher, returns for the next 12 months were positive  65% of the time versus 82% overall, BofA said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     So the bank's voicing caution in a crowded market, as they put it. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"The [sell-side indicator] has been a reliable contrarian indicator. In other words, it has been bullish when Wall Street was extremely bearish and vice versa,\" and now sits at the closest to a sell signal since December 2021, said Subramanian and Roloff. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Last month, those strategists left their equity allocations unchanged after a 2.8% gain for the S&amp;P 500 SPX in December, which suggests a wait-and-see approach on trade tensions and any policy risks, said the BofA team. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"The current level of 57% implies an estimated price return of 10.5% over the [next twelve months], lower than the past two years but still healthy. We see this as support for our view that 2025 is a year for buying stocks, not the index,\" they said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Societe Generale has predicted 2025 will be the best stock picking period in 25 years, citing reflationary policies from President Trump's administration, such as lower taxes, less regulation and lower oil prices, which they say can all yield potential stock picking ideas. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Plus: Stock market's wild ride on Monday could be a microcosm of what to expect in 2025 </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The markets </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     U.S. stock-index futures (ES00) (YM00) (NQ00) are lower, while Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y BX:TMUBMUSD02Y are rising, and the ICE Dollar Index dollar DXY is down 0.4%.
