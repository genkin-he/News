Lerner said they expect the U.S. economy to stay resilient in 2025, given how it weathered the pandemic, high inflation and the fastest Fed rate-hiking cycle in decades.

Excluding all items that affect comparability from both periods, adjusted net income was $65.9 million, or $1.39 per share, in the current year quarter compared to $55.3 million, or $1.07 per share, in the prior year quarter. For a reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income, and earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share, see the attached table.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $131.2 million, a 13% increase from the prior year quarter of $116.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding unallocated amounts (primarily corporate overhead) of $14.0 million in the current quarter and $13.9 million in the prior year quarter, totaled $145.2 million, increasing 11% from the prior year of $130.3 million.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Mark Hulbert </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     High-yield bond holders aren't asking for much of a premium above ultra-safe U.S. Treasurys. Time to own quality. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Junk-bond investors are giving zero odds to a global trade war. They are almost certainly wrong, since even if a trade war is avoided, the odds are not zero. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Consider the junk-bond spread, which is the additional yield above ultra-safe U.S. Treasury bonds that investors demand for incurring the risk of high-yield, or \"junk\" bonds. Nowadays they're not asking for much, and that isn't a good sign. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     In fact, the last time the junk-bond spread was as low as it is now was in the summer of 2007, just before the Global Financial Crisis. What happened next? Treasury yields plunged while junk yields soared. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The chart below plots the junk-bond spread over the past three decades. Not only do you have to go back to 2007 to find the spread as low as it is now, the current spread is about half of the three-decade average. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Today's low spread would be a worry even if a global trade war weren't a distinct possibility. Far more often than not over the past three decades, junk spreads that were especially low were higher 12- and 24 months later. Conversely, high spreads were lower. This reversal tendency is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level that statisticians often use when determining if a pattern is genuine. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This pattern is summarized in the table above. To construct it, I focused first on the 20% of months since 1997 with the lowest junk-bond spreads, and contrasted that group's experience with that of the quintile of months with the highest junk spreads. Low spreads on average are followed by higher spreads over the subsequent one- and two-year periods - and vice versa. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The current junk spread, at 2.73%, is not just in the lowest quintile - it is lower than 97% of all monthly readings since 1997. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     In theory at least, there is more than one way in which the junk spread could widen in coming months. Junk-bond yields could rise while Treasury yields stay constant, for example, or junk yields could stay steady and Treasurys yields fall. But during periods of economic weakness, it is almost always the case that the junk spread widens by both yields moving in opposite directions - junk yields rising and Treasurys falling. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Bond investors would do well to favor Treasurys over junk bonds right now. There's also a market-neutral way of betting on the junk-spread widening: Create a long position in Treasurys while shorting an equal dollar amount of junk bonds. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The junk-bond ETF with the most assets under management is the iShares Broad High Yield Corporate Bond ETF USHY, with $18.6 billion in assets under management (AUM) and a 0.08% expense ratio. Since the average maturity of its bonds is around five years, according to investment researcher Morningstar, when shorting it you would pair it with a U.S. Treasury ETF with similar average maturity. The intermediate-term Treasury ETF with the most assets under management is the Vanguard Intermediate Term Treasury ETF VGIT, with $30.7 billion in AUM and a 0.04% expense ratio. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Mark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The ride-hailing company faces stiff pressure from the strong U.S. dollar, which is weighing on its forecast for the current quarter </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Uber Technologies Inc. Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said the company just had its \"strongest quarter ever.\" But that doesn't seem enough to help Uber's stock early Wednesday, and the ride-hailing giant fell short because of a portion of its outlook. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Shares of Uber (UBER) are down more than 6% in Wednesday's premarket trading. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Uber posted a series of beats for the fourth quarter, including revenue of $12.0 billion, up 20% from a year earlier and ahead of the $11.8 billion consensus view. Additionally, the company saw 18% growth in gross bookings, a metric that tracks the dollar value of rides and orders made through Uber's platform. Gross bookings amounted to $44.2 billion, while analysts tracked by FactSet were modeling $43.5 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Uber said that trips, gross bookings and monthly active platform customers all showed accelerating growth in the fourth quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The company's outlook for this quarter's gross bookings, though, trailed expectations at the midpoint. Uber models $42.0 billion to $43.5 billion on the metric, whereas analysts had been projecting $43.5 billion. Uber anticipates it will feel the sting of a strong U.S. dollar, as the company projects gross bookings for the first quarter will reflect a 5.5-percentage-point negative impact from currency. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Other multinational companies, including Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) have warned about foreign-exchange headwinds when setting their own first-quarter expectations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Uber also forecasts $1.79 billion to $1.89 billion in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the first quarter, whereas analysts were looking for $1.85 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     While Uber shares enjoyed a huge run during 2023, the stock has treaded water more recently and is up just 1% over the past 12 months. One issue that's weighed on the stock is the progress Alphabet's Waymo has made in the robotaxi realm. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     See also: Tesla is acting like an AI stock. Should investors focus more on auto trends? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Khosrowshahi said in the earnings release that Uber's performance \"has been powered by rapid innovation and execution across multiple priorities, including the massive opportunity presented by autonomous vehicles.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, Uber flagged that in January it entered into a $1.5 billion accelerated-share-repurchase agreement, part of a $7.0 billion buyback authorization that the company had previously announced. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"We believe we remain undervalued despite these strong fundamentals, and plan to be active and opportunistic buyers of our stock,\" Chief Financial Officer Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah said in the release. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
