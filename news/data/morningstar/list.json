Infineon had previously forecast a slight decline. Meanwhile, Infineon's segment result margin--a key profitability measure--is still expected in the mid-to-high-teens percentage range. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The upgrade comes after what Infineon said was a slightly better start to the fiscal year than expected amid a boost in semiconductors sales for servers and data centers to power AI. However, areas of the semiconductor industry outside of artificial intelligence continue to suffer from sluggish demand. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Orders for legacy chips found in cars and industrial equipment has been subdued in recent months as car makers and manufacturers of industrial machinery cut spending since they stockpiled the semiconductors they needed years ago. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The divergence in demand between AI chips and legacy semiconductors meant that chip makers with significant AI exposure like Nvidia have grown exponentially, while companies such as Infineon that mostly sell chips to the automotive sector and makers of industrial equipment have struggled. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Infineon slashed its sales guidance three times in the previous fiscal year. Last week, Tesla supplier STMicroelectronics said it was expecting lower sales this quarter, citing challenges in demand for legacy semiconductors. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  \"Following the expected inventory reduction, we continue to anticipate that the recovery in demand will be gradual for the current fiscal year,\" Infineon Chief Executive Jochen Hanebeck said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The company posted 3.42 billion euros in sales in the three months to the end of December, down 8% on year. Infineon's automotive division--which accounts for the lion's share of revenue--logged a 8% contraction in sales. Only the power and sensor systems business reported an increase in sales, lifted by chips for servers and data centers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Net profit declined to 246 million euros from 587 million euros, while Infineon's segment result contracted to 573 million euros from 831 million euros, generating a 16.7% margin. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Analysts had forecast quarterly sales of nearly 3.23 billion euros, a net profit of 252 million euros, a segment result of 477 million euros and a 14.8% margin, according to a Vara Research consensus. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  For the current quarter, Infineon is expecting sales of around 3.6 billion euros and a segment result margin in the mid-teens percentage range. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Write to Mauro Orru at mauro.orru@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  February 04, 2025 02:27 ET (07:27 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

China's Commerce Ministry also said that it would tighten control of exports of some critical minerals but didn't single out exports to any particular country. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The earlier market cheer soured, with the offshore yuan weakening against the dollar, while benchmark indexes in Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea pared gains. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Oil futures extended losses, with front-month WTI crude oil futures down 1.8% to $71.83 per barrel, and Brent down 1.2% to $75.07 per barrel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Bitcoin tumbled, falling below the key $100,000 handle. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Japan's Nikkei Stock Average closed 0.7% higher on Tuesday, after rising as much as 1.7% earlier in the session. Hong Kong's benchmark index lost some ground after China's announcement but remains about 2.3% higher, while South Korea's Kospi closed up 1.1%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Other Asian stock markets also held their ground. Taiwan's Taiex index gained 0.4% and Malaysia's benchmark Kuala Lumpur Composite Index rose 0.5%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Spot gold was broadly steady, sitting 0.1% lower at $2,811.23 per ounce </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Amid the heightened tensions, China's market regulator Tuesday said it had opened an investigation into U.S. technology giant Google on suspected violation of antitrust law. Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comments. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Trump's aggressive move to place tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in imports rattled investors, economists and some lawmakers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  In a social media post, Trump said that his administration will see in the next 30 days if an \"economic deal\" with Canada can be structured. He had made similar comments about Mexico. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  \"A headlines-driven market seems synonymous with Trump 2.0, much like in 2016,\" Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG, said in a note. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Until recently, many on Wall Street viewed threats of the U.S. imposing the highest tariffs in decades as a negotiating tactic in border disputes over drug trafficking and migration, and unlikely to materialize. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  \"We still think that permanent tariffs on the U.S.'s allies (Canada, Mexico) will not be a thing,\" said Thierry Wizman, global foreign-exchange and rates strategist at Macquarie. \"Tariffs [are] likely to be reversed before they do serious damage.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  \"That's because concessions are an 'easier' way to deal with Trump's 'problems'...and Trump likes to make 'deals,'\" Wizman said in a note. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  However, a deal might not be so easy in regards to China, analysts say. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The \"overarching geo-economic dimensions to U.S.-China trade means that resolution will be far more fraught than is the case with Mexico and Canada,\" Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho Securities' head of macro research for Asia, excluding Japan, said in a note. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Relief isn't resolution, and Trump has warned that tariff plans are intact, Varathan said. U.S.-driven trade antagonism threats remain at large, and \"it promises to be a bumpy ride for markets in the weeks ahead,\" with currency markets set up to be the most sensitive to U.S. tariff threats, he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The euro, Korean won, Thai baht, Malaysian ringgit, Australian dollar and offshore yuan remain on the line, Varathan said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said the new tariffs are \"likely only the beginning of a long process for the two countries to negotiate.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Negotiations between the U.S. and its neighbors suggest that there is some hope of de-escalation at some point, though the road ahead is likely to be bumpy, Zhang said. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  --Fabiana Negrin Ochoa, Ronnie Harui and Farah Elias contributed to this article. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Write to Kimberley Kao at kimberley.kao@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  February 04, 2025 02:14 ET (07:14 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",
