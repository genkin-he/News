The funds will accelerate development and build capabilities to uncover vulnerabilities in cloud environments. The company also plans to double down its focus on using AI to give developers and security engineers the ability to build security detections. The company has been building its platform since 2018 while remaining cash-positive.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nLast year, Astra Security uncovered nearly 5,500 vulnerabilities per day for its customers with its AI-powered pentest platform. This number is expected to increase threefold by the end of the year as cyber threats continue to evolve at an unprecedented pace. With AI, the speed at which code is being shipped rapidly increases. This means attackers have an even larger attack surface area to find vulnerabilities. AI has become equally popular among hackers for finding loopholes at scale, which can lead to more breaches.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n“The cybercrime landscape is becoming increasingly complex with AI-based attacks,\" said <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Shikhil Sharma, co-founder and CEO of Astra Security</strong>. \"Traditional, periodic pentesting is no longer enough in today’s threat environment, and Astra Security is moving more businesses to continuous pentesting to stay ahead of hackers. The engineering world has become agile, collaborative, and automation-driven, but the cybersecurity industry has lagged behind. It’s our mission to breathe life into the security space by integrating AI, adopting a hacker's mindset, and making the tech easy and accessible.\"\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nOver 800 engineering teams in over 70 countries use Astra Security. AI powers the platform and can constantly mimic hacker behavior to check applications for vulnerabilities through fast detections. This includes PTaaS (Penetration Testing as a Service), a DAST vulnerability scanner, and an API Security Platform that all work together to find over 13,000 vulnerabilities. Last year, Astra Security helped its customers discover and prioritize remediation of over two million vulnerabilities.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n“Security is increasingly shifting to the hands of developers, while security teams find themselves more overwhelmed than ever,” said <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Ananda Krishna, co-founder and CTO of Astra Security</strong>. “While pentests have been around for over a decade, they are overdue for an AI-first update—simplifying and streamlining the process. We’re focused on removing the frustration of continuous security monitoring so businesses can get on with everything else.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nAstra Security founders Shikhil Sharma and Ananda Krishna have been hackers and builders for over a decade—first helping big brands like Microsoft, Adobe, AT&amp;T, Yahoo, and Blackberry find critical vulnerabilities in their infrastructure. This led to the creation of Astra Security and the company’s focus on an AI-powered platform to bring the cybersecurity industry forward.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nAstra’s growth round totaled $2.7 million. The company is rapidly gaining traction among leading organizations. Last year, more than 25% of their customers were mid-sized and large companies, including Loom, HackerRank, ITC, Olx Autos, Mamaearth, Muthoot Finance, Bonusly Singapore Trade Exchange, Oscilar, University of Cambridge, CompTIA, and Prime Healthcare.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">About Astra Security</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nAstra Security is a cyber security SaaS company simplifying otherwise chaotic penetration with its Pentest Platform. Astra Security's AI-powered offensive vulnerability scanning engine emulates hacker behavior to scan applications for 10,000+ security tests. CTOs &amp; CISOs trust Astra Security because it helps them fix vulnerabilities in record time and move from DevOps to DevSecOps with Astra Security's CI/CD integrations.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n800+ companies across the globe use Astra Security. Last year, Astra Security uncovered 2,000,000+ vulnerabilities for its customers, saving customers $69M+ in potential losses due to security vulnerabilities.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-91967a64=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-91967a64=\"\"><source sizes=\"(max-width: 768w)\" srcset=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250205502953r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 1x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250205502953r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 2x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250205502953r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 3x\"><source sizes=\"(max-width: 1092w)\" srcset=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250205502953r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 1x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250205502953r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 2x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250205502953r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 3x\"><source sizes=\"(max-width: 600w)\" srcset=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250205502953r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 1x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250205502953r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 2x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250205502953r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 3x\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250205502953r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en\"/></source></source></source></picture></span><span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"></span></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Media Contact \n</strong><br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/><a class=\"mdc-link mds-link mdc-link--body\" data-v-4234e9e2=\"\" href=\"mailto:onboard@sbscomms.com\" tabindex=\"0\">onboard@sbscomms.com</a>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">View source version on businesswire.com: </span><span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><a class=\"mdc-link mds-link mdc-link--body\" data-v-4234e9e2=\"\" href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250205502953/en/\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250205502953/en/</a></span></p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Robb M. Stewart </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  OTTAWA--Canada swung to a global trade surplus for the first time in 10 months at the end of last year as the local currency continued to weaken and energy shipments to the U.S. rose. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The country posted a merchandise-trade surplus in December of 708 million Canadian dollars, the equivalent of about $494.3 million, Statistics Canada said Wednesday. That was narrower than the C$1.03 billion surplus expected by economists and comes after November's deficit was revised upward by C$663 million to C$986 million. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n   The shift for the month still left Canada with a deficit with the world of about C$7.2 billion, much wider than the C$610 million shortfall the year before. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The country's merchandise exports in December increased 4.9% to C$69.46 billion, while imports rose 2.3% to C$68.76 billion, the data agency said. For the year, imports advanced 1.9% to outpace a 1.0% lift in global exports. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Economic growth in Canada picked up over the final quarter of last year following a string of interest rate cuts by the central bank since June as inflation has cooled. There remains a great deal of uncertainty over what 2025 will bring as the country braces for possible U.S. tariffs on imports from Canada. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The rise in exports in December was the largest since last February, though the growth was due in part to the sharp depreciation of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar for a third month running, given a large portion of trade is completed in the U.S. currency. In volume terms, exports for the month were up 2.6% from November. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Exports of energy products jumped 9.5% from the month before, with a rise in the value of crude oil. Exports of mineral products also rose strongly, and Canada shipped more motor vehicles and parts, as well as farm, fishing and intermediate food products for the month. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  In preparation for President Trump's threatened levies, some businesses accelerated shipments. A KPMG survey of 250 business leaders across Canada last month found 65% preemptively shipped goods or products ahead of Trump's inauguration and almost half have plans to shift investment and would set up operations or production south of the border to serve the U.S. market and reduce costs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Trump on Monday struck last-minute deals to delay by one month plans to levy hefty tariffs on Canada to see if in that time an \"economic deal\" with Canada can be structured. Trump has repeatedly complained about America's trade deficit with its northern neighbor. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Statistics Canada's data showed Canada's long-standing surplus with the U.S. narrowed slightly last year to roughly C$102.2 billion from C$108.3 billion in 2023. Cross-border trade between the two countries topped the C$1 trillion mark for a third consecutive year in 2024, with the U.S. the destination for almost 76% of all exports and the source for some 62% of overall imports. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Energy products remain the key to Canada's surplus with its neighbor. The country exported about C$176.2 billion of energy last year, roughly 88% of which went to the U.S. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  For December, Canada's exports to the U.S. were up 5.0% following a 6.7% rise the month before. The same month, imports of U.S. goods fell 1.5%, which widened the trade surplus between the countries to C$11.34 billion from C$8.19 billion in November. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  That came as Canada's deficit with countries other than the U.S. widened to roughly C$10.6 billion in December from C$9.2 billion the month before. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  When international trade in goods and international trade in services were combined, Canadian exports rose 4.1% in December, while imports increased 1.6%. As a result, Canada's trade incorporating both goods and services swung to a surplus of C$641 million in December from a C$1.43 billion deficit the month before. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Combining both services and goods traded with the U.S. over the last year, and Canada recorded an overall trade surplus of about C$94.4 billion with its neighbor. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Write to Robb M.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Joshua Kirby </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Hiring in the private sector picked up pace at the start of the year, suggesting the jobs market remains tight. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Private businesses added 183,000 jobs in January, up from 176,000 in December, according to the ADP National Employment report released Wednesday. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had expected 150,000 new jobs in January. The total for December was revised upward, pointing to better-than-estimated momentum at the end of last year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Still, strength in jobs in consumer-facing industries like hospitality masked weakness elsewhere, said Nela Richardson, ADP's chief economist. Manufacturing jobs decreased by 13,000 over the month, while areas like construction added a few jobs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  \"We had a strong start to 2025 but it masked a dichotomy in the labor market,\" Richardson said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Pay growth for those staying in their jobs was meanwhile stable on the month, but for job-changers the average increase accelerated. That will likely add to caution among Federal Reserve policymakers still wary of upward pressure on consumer prices from robust pay packets. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Signs of strength in hiring contrast with figures showing more workers are staying in their jobs as prospects cool for a better position elsewhere. Americans quit 39.6 million jobs in 2024, down 11% from the year before and down 22% from a recent peak in 2022, according to Labor Department data published this week. The share of employees who quit their jobs each month has fallen below the prepandemic level, and some economists expect more decreases ahead. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Write to Joshua Kirby at joshua.kirby@wsj.com; @joshualeokirby </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  February 05, 2025 08:52 ET (13:52 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Adria Calatayud </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Banco Santander said it plans to buy back 10 billion euros ($10.38 billion) of its own stock after it reported fourth-quarter results that exceeded expectations, sending shares sharply higher. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Spain's biggest lender by assets became the latest bank in Europe to outline plans for bumper returns to shareholders. European banks took steps to clean up their balance sheets and restore profitability amid high interest rates in recent years and have continued to hand money back to shareholders even as central banks moved to lower rates. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Santander said Wednesday that it expects to return 10 billion euros to shareholders through stock repurchases from its earnings this year and next on top of its dividend. Its plans came hot on the heels of buyback announcements on Tuesday from UBS Group, Intesa Sanpaolo and BNP Paribas. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The news sent the stock up, rising 7% higher in European afternoon trade to levels last seen in 2018. The jump made Santander the biggest bank of the eurozone by market capitalization with a value topping 80 billion euros, overtaking BNP Paribas and Intesa Sanpaolo. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The bank said it plans to start a new buyback program of about 1.59 billion euros on Thursday for which it already obtained regulatory authorization. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Santander said it was confident it would be able to boost profitability again in 2025, raising a key profitability target despite projecting broadly stable revenue for the year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Net profit for the fourth quarter was 3.265 billion euros, up 11% on year, Santander said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Total income for the quarter rose 10% to 16.03 billion euros, mainly driven by higher net fee income. Net interest income--the difference between what a bank earns on loans and what it pays clients for deposits--came to 11.99 billion euros, up 6.8% on the prior quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Analysts had expected Santander to post a net profit of 2.95 billion euros on revenue of 15.39 billion euros, according to consensus estimates provided by Visible Alpha. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The bank attributed the profit rise to increases at its main income streams that offset higher costs and a hit from a U.K. provision to cover potential costs from a court ruling on the disclosure of dealer commissions on car loans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  For 2025, Santander expects revenue of about 62 billion euros, mid-high single digit growth in net fee income, lower costs and a return on tangible equity--a key profitability metric for banks--of more than 17%. It had previously targeted a 2025 return on tangible equity of 15% to 17%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Santander executive chair, Ana Botin, said in a call with analysts she expected a challenging environment in 2025, but that the bank's progress toward its 2025 targets put it well ahead of plan. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  \"Our track record shows that in a challenging market we outperform peers and in 2025 we expect to grow our bottom line and profitability--with revenue stable and costs falling,\" Botin said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The bank's full-year revenue climbed 7.9% to 61.88 billion euros in 2024 and its return on tangible equity for the year stood at 16.3%, up from 15.1% a year before. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Write to Adria Calatayud at adria.calatayud@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  February 05, 2025 08:41 ET (13:41 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",
