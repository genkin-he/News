The stock is up 18.6% over the past 12 months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Ahead of the results, analysts were focused on whether the chain could keep up same-store sales growth this year, following solid trends last year, as shoppers grappling with higher costs of living remain picky about dining out. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Some analysts said tougher comparisons, harsher weather and holiday timing may have put pressure on Chipotle's recent sales. But while fast-food chains, after raising prices, have tried to win back consumers with value deals, some analysts say customers believe they can get a better meal at fast-casual chains for a price that's not much higher. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Chipotle's management, during the call, said they were focused on opening more restaurants internationally, while outfitting its new restaurants with upgraded equipment - like rice cookers, faster-cooking grills and fryers that can fry more chips - that can help with faster, more consistent service. The company has a goal to open 7,000 restaurants in North America. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Executives said they planned to launch a new limited-time menu offering around mid- to late March, and expressed excitement about menu items to come later in the year. And as businesses race to find more ways to use artificial intelligence, Chipotle said it was developing ways to deploy the technology to keep customers from drifting toward other options. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"When the model detects that a customer's behavior is changing in a particular way that would signal the propensity for churn, we will take them on a new journey with personalized extras and offers to encourage them to re-engage,\" Scott Boatwright, Chipotle's new chief executive, said on the call. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"I think those things are going to drive meaningful difference within the digital channel,\" he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     For the fourth quarter, Chipotle reported revenue of $2.845 billion, up 13.1% year over year, with same-store sales up 5.4%. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 25 cents. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Analysts polled by FactSet expected Chipotle to report adjusted earnings per share of 24 cents, on sales of $2.85 billion and a same-store sales gain of 5.7%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Chipotle executives, during the call on Tuesday, said items like its limited-time brisket offer were popular with diners, even though it was a difficult  item to procure. But they said that a multi-year absence from Chipotle's menu helped build up anticipation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"I know I probably ate it once a week throughout the entire season,\" Boatwright said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Bill Peters </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

This transformation is the convergence of Edge Computing, Hyperconverged Networks, and the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the very edge that all things connect to the network, commonly referred to as Edge AI.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">We have developed a portfolio of fully integrated, scalable, and turnkey wireless and wired communications and computing devices and services - VeeaHub products, VeeaWare, and VeeaCloud – that deliver cloud-to-edge solutions and allow businesses to manage high volumes of data to enable real-time applications and maintain system reliability. Our solutions have been iterated over the last several years to minimize production costs, reduce installation expenses, and deliver scalability with easy integration to third party solutions, resulting in a lower total cost of ownership compared to typical edge computing solutions.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">We possess more than 100 exclusively-owned patents covering 26 patent families, and a significant partner ecosystem. Our products have been deployed to enterprises and SMB/SMEs across several countries, providing real-world solutions across various end markets. We are transforming lives from remote villages in Indonesia, where Veea’s mesh network is empowering internet connectivity in health, education, and agriculture, to retailers in Mexico, farms in North America, a campus in Hong Kong, and a 21-acre commercial building complex in Orlando, Florida where our Veea Edge Platform is enabling common indoor and outdoor common area Wi-Fi.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Well Positioned to Support the 5</strong><span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">th</strong></span><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\"> Industrial Revolution<br data-v-43363f62=\"\"/></strong>Significant advances in AI technologies are now driving the 5th Industrial Revolution, fundamentally reshaping how we live, work, and interact. Unlike previous industrial revolutions driven by mechanization, electricity, computing, and automation, the 5th Industrial Revolution is characterized by the seamless integration of AI and human intelligence to enhance decision-making, improve productivity, and drive innovation across every sector. This is not just a technological trend; it is a pivotal force shaping the future of industries, economies, and our organization.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">AI inferencing is at the heart of this revolution, driving a new business paradigm that demands a fresh approach to technology infrastructure and service delivery. AI inferencing refers to the process where a trained AI model applies its learned knowledge to analyze new, unseen data and generate predictions or decisions based on the patterns it has identified during training; essentially, it's the \"action\" of using an AI model to make sense of “new information” and draw conclusions from it. For many enterprise and consumer use cases massive amounts of data must be collected and processed at the edge. Among many of its utilities, this is what Veea Edge Platform does most efficiently.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Veea’s unique implementation of Edge AI brings the power of AI closer to where data is generated—at the “edge” of networks. This means faster decision-making, reduced latency, enhanced security, increased reliability, data privacy and sovereignty, and real-time insights without the dependency on centralized cloud infrastructure. Edge Computing complements this by processing data locally, significantly improving efficiency and reducing bandwidth costs.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Edge Computing is not just a supporting technology—it is the core capability that enables AI inferencing to deliver real-time, context-aware insights to both enterprises and consumers alike. By processing data closer to the source, Edge Computing ensures that AI applications are responsive, resilient, and efficient. This shift requires businesses to adopt new operational models, emphasizing agility, scalability, and decentralized intelligence.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS)<br data-v-43363f62=\"\"/></strong>At Veea, we are at the forefront of this transformation, leveraging Edge Computing to power our AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) offerings.
