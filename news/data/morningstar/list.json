            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\"><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Momentus Selected by U.S. Air Force for Space Demonstration </strong><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">of Rendezvous Using Low-Cost Multi-Spectral Sensor Suite</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nMomentus Inc. (NASDAQ: MNTS), a U.S. commercial space company offering satellite buses, technologies, transportation, and other in-space transportation services, today announced that the U.S. Air Force Research Labs AFWERX organization has selected a proposal from Momentus to perform an in-space demonstration flight of a new, low-cost suite of multispectral sensors for Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO).\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nAFWERX is the innovation arm of the U.S. Air Force under the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). AFWERX has been chartered to bring cutting-edge ingenuity from small businesses to address the most pressing challenges of the Air Force.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nIn 2024, Momentus submitted a proposal under the AFWERX Challenge and was recently formally notified that its proposal for a Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project to perform a multi-spectral RPO demonstration was selected after evaluation in a competitive process. Momentus expects to complete contract negotiations shortly. This selection underscores Momentus' commitment to pioneering innovative solutions for national defense.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nUnder the SBIR project, Momentus plans to use a Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO) system it has developed using internal R&amp;D funds and use an optical sensor, infrared sensor, and a Lidar sensor. (Lidar is a remote-sensing technology that uses laser beams to measure distances and movement in an environment.)\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nA flight demonstration in early 2026 is planned that will show the ability for low-cost RPO sensors to safely guide the approach and rendezvous of a space vehicle with a previously uncharacterized client object using machine vision algorithms and data fusion developed by Momentus. Reducing the cost while ensuring high operational safety for in-space rendezvous is a key enabling technology needed for the future of in-space refueling of satellites, manufacturing, assembly, servicing, and debris removal.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nThe rendezvous sensor demonstration for AFWERX will join other payloads, including from the Department of Defense and commercial customers, on a mission that Momentus has contracted with SpaceX to join a Transporter rideshare launch in early 2026.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nFor this mission, Momentus has additional capacity to support customers planning LEO deployment and hosted payload missions in early 2026. Government and commercial customers interested in utilizing the ability of the Vigoride vehicle to cost-effectively launch and deliver microsatellites up to 200 kg and cubesats, provide average power up to 1kW, and deploy or operate hosted payloads in orbits above 500 km and below the International Space Station are encouraged to contact Momentus while booking opportunities remain open at <a class=\"mdc-link mds-link mdc-link--body\" data-v-4234e9e2=\"\" href=\"mailto:sales@momentusspace.com\" tabindex=\"0\">sales@momentusspace.com</a>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nâWeâre thrilled to be selected to perform this in-space demonstration to support the U.S. Air Force with cutting-edge technology,â said Momentus Chief Executive Officer John Rood. \"Weâre at a key juncture in the development of technology to enable new operations in space that are critical to Americaâs security and commercial operations in space. We see this selection as an exceptional opportunity to continue Momentus technology leadership to support national security and new commercial activities.\"\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">About Momentus Inc.</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nMomentus is a U.S. commercial space company that offers commercial satellite buses and in-space infrastructure services including in-space transportation, hosted payloads, and other in-orbit services.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Forward-Looking Statements</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nThis press release contains certain statements which may constitute âforward-looking statementsâ for purposes of the federal securities laws.

While everyone should have equal access to mental health services, factors such as race, gender, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and sexual orientation are shown to play a role in how fairly people are treated in the mental health care system of today.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Statistics show that white adults are more likely to receive mental health services as opposed to their Black and Hispanic counterparts. While 50% of women ages 18-64 reported needing mental health services in the past year in one study, only half of those were able to get treatment. Nearly half of LGBT adults say they needed mental health care in the past three years but didn't get it.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\"People need help, but they aren't getting it,\" said Waldman. \"The fact is that our minds are making us sick, and the mental health system isn't working. The great news is that there's a better way, a way that doesn't require people to rely solely on a framework that isn't working.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Instead, says Waldman, people can use a philosophy created by his group, the Brainyites.

Today, we issued the following open letter to shareholders of Daktronics, Inc. (NASDAQ: DAKT) (âDAKTâ or the âCompanyâ) explaining our intention to <strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\"><span data-v-43363f62=\"\">vote AGAINST</span></strong> the Companyâs proposed reincorporation from South Dakota to Delaware, pursuant to which DAKT primarily is seeking to eliminate cumulative voting.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nFebruary 4, 2025\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nFellow Shareholders:\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nBreach Inlet Capital remains a top 10 shareholder of DAKT with ownership of 2.0% of its outstanding shares, which is more than each of the Companyâs directors and executive officers. We previously issued a <a class=\"mdc-link mds-link mdc-link--body\" data-v-4234e9e2=\"\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businesswire.com%2Fnews%2Fhome%2F20241216340543%2Fen%2FBreach-Inlet-Capital-Issues-Public-Letter-to-Board-of-Daktronics&amp;esheet=54199085&amp;newsitemid=20250204698987&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=public+letter&amp;index=1&amp;md5=2c3a8bef17619fc78eb697bbe199c365\" tabindex=\"0\">public letter</a> in December 2024 encouraging the Board of Directors of the Company (the âBoardâ) to act in the best interests of shareholders and offering recommendations that we believe would improve DAKT.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nInstead of heeding our advice, the Board has taken steps to eliminate a valuable shareholder right. Specifically, the Board has called a special meeting of shareholders seeking shareholder approval to reincorporate the Company from South Dakota to Delaware. While the Board claims the Delaware reincorporation would âprotect the interests of shareholders<em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">,</em>â<span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">1</span> the Boardâs self-professed primary motive for seeking reincorporation is the elimination of cumulative voting. This makes clear to us that the Board is attempting to further entrench itself and the management team at the expense of shareholders. Cumulative voting is a powerful tool that enables minority shareholders to more easily gain Board representation and hold a companyâs leadership team accountable. The elimination of such a right is not in the best interests of shareholders. It is quite telling that the Board is seeking to remove this pro-shareholder right, but not eliminate the shareholder-unfriendly classified Board structure as part of the reincorporation process.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nFurthermore, according to the preliminary proxy statement filed by Alta Fox Capital Management, LLC (âAlta Foxâ) on January 31, 2025, âadvisors to the Company reached out to advisors to Alta Fox and threatened that if a negotiated resolution could not be reached promptly, the Company would remove cumulative voting.â If true, this means that Alta Foxâs publicly disclosed efforts to improve DAKTâs corporate governance were met by the Board with a threat (and ultimately concerted action) to eliminate a valuable right to all shareholders.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nAs outlined in our prior public letter, we want significant enhancements to DAKTâs corporate governance, leadership, investor communications, executive compensation practices and capital allocation decisions. While we appreciate the constructive conversations we have had with certain members of DAKT leadership, it is readily apparent that the Board is unwilling to make the changes that we and other shareholders believe are necessary. Therefore, we believe it is extremely important for shareholders to maintain the current cumulative voting right. Otherwise, eliminating such right is likely to make it more difficult for shareholders to reconstitute the composition of the Board with candidates who are committed to acting in the best interests of all shareholders.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nFor the foregoing reasons, we intend to<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\"> <span data-v-43363f62=\"\">vote AGAINST</span> </strong>the Companyâs proposed reincorporation from South Dakota to Delaware.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nBest Regards,\n<br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/>Chris Colvin, CFA\n<br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/>Founder and Portfolio Manager\n<br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/>Breach Inlet Capital Management, LLC\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OF AUTHORITY TO VOTE YOUR PROXY.
