Plus, the DeepSeek fallout lingers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Nvidia Corp.'s stock fell Monday as investors weighed the potential for tariffs to impact chip companies and continued to assess the fallout from DeepSeek. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) slid 2.8% to rank among the worst performers in the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX. The stock pared losses after President Donald Trump said he had agreed to pause the Mexico tariffs for a month. A similar deal to delay tariffs on Canada came later in the day. China still faces 10% tariffs starting at midnight. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Still, investors are wondering how tariffs will play out in the semiconductor sector.

Those \"end-device\" categories have more links to China, Mexico and Canada, he noted. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     In Nvidia's case, he flagged a Reuters report from last year showing that Foxconn (TW:2354) was aiming to build a huge Mexico factory that would bundle Nvidia GB200 chips. Overall, Rasgon noted that the U.S. imports $39 billion of data-processing equipment like servers and computers from China as well as $28 billion from Mexico. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"Hence the prospect for indirect effects seems high (though of course not just for semiconductors),\" Rasgon wrote, flagging that the import values for electrical equipment and machinery and vehicles are even larger. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said he thought these introductory tariffs seemed more like \"scare tactics\" and advised investors to consider buying affected names on their pullbacks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"We believe short-term supply-chain disruptions for the chip ecosystem will be very limited during this period as it relates to Nvidia, AMD, TSMC and others with retaliatory measures from Beijing as limited in the near-term,\" Ives wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, Nvidia's stock is still tied up in the continued discussion about DeepSeek's artificial-intelligence advancements and their potential to impact chip spending. Melius Research's Ben Reitzes had a nuanced view as he took stock of the situation early Monday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"To be clear, we [do] believe that cheaper models and the techniques that DeepSeek demonstrated will actually have the effect of increasing the adoption of AI - eventually,\" he wrote in a note to clients. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     But things are still complicated for Nvidia shares \"as we see prospects for further volatility as we try to figure out if we take a step back in spending, before we take giant leaps forward,\" Reitzes added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     See more: Does DeepSeek spell doomsday for Nvidia and other AI stocks?

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Therese Poletti </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Apple Inc. was one of the luckier consumer-electronics companies when it got exemptions from the tariffs imposed by the first Trump administration on many goods made in China. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     But this time, it might not be quite as fortunate. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The additional 10% tariffs on goods made in China being imposed by the Trump administration this time around are, for now, expected to include the iPhone - and it's reasonable to assume Apple (AAPL) will pass this added cost on to their customers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Last week, during Apple's earnings call, Chief Executive Tim Cook declined to comment on the subject of tariffs on Chinese-made goods. That was an indication that the company did not yet have any kind of exemption from the much-anticipated tariffs, as Wall Street has been hoping for. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Read: Trump agrees to delay tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Next up is talks with China. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     So far, the 10% tariff is much less than previously expected, but it could incite Apple to move more of its manufacturing outside of China. During the last trade war enacted by Trump, many tech companies began to explore moving - and many eventually did move - some manufacturing from China to other countries in Asia. Apple still makes the bulk of its iPhones in China. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     On the earnings call, Cook told investors he was keen on India as an emerging market for its products. In recent years, Apple has also shifted a little over 10% of iPhone manufacturing to three major contractors in India, including Foxconn, according to India's Business Standard. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan isn't so sure Apple will increase its prices, and believes the company can move most of its iPhone manufacturing to India. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"Apple could have its manufacturing partners ramp up production in India and ship to the U.S.,\" Mohan told clients Monday. \"This could also be done for other Apple products that are manufactured in countries including Vietnam, Malaysia, etc. We have assumed 80% of Apple products sold in the U.S. can be sourced from other countries, apart from China.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     He said if 50% of Apple's devices are still sourced in China, the EPS impact would be 12 cents per share if Apple does not raise prices, and 7 cents per share if it raises them. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     For now, though, Mohan left his estimates on Apple unchanged. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     But the industry group that produces CES in Las Vegas believes the tariffs are bad for the industry and will certainly lead to price hikes, even though the tariffs are lower than it previously projected. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"Tariffs are taxes on American consumers, not foreign governments or companies. Increasing tariffs on imports from Canada, China and Mexico will fuel inflation and raise prices on tech products, automotive manufacturing, and services,\" said Gary Shapiro, the president of the Consumer Technology Association, in a statement Monday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     If Apple raises prices on the iPhone and possibly other products, it won't be alone. In the last trade war, which began in 2018 when Trump enacted tariffs against China, some tech companies imposed price hikes due to their own rising costs that they partially or fully passed on to consumers. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The 10% tariffs Trump announced over the weekend on China were much lower than the 60% tariffs analysts and policy watchers had been expecting. In addition, the president included 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico - but on Monday afternoon put those on pause for a month. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     If the U.S. tariffs on Mexican-made goods end up going through, other consumer-electronics products could see price hikes as well. In the PC sector, HP Inc. (HPQ) and Dell Technologies Inc. (DELL) are among those with some manufacturing or assembly operations in Mexico. (Neither company responded to requests for comment.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Intel Corp. (INTC), though, said on its earnings call last week that it believed part of its slightly better-than-expected revenue was due to its customers buying ahead of tariffs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"I expect the tariffs to definitely impact the tech sector,\" said Dan Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company. \"I just expect the impact will not be as devastating as the Street is anticipating.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Even so, the latest tariffs appear to be political volleys. The new administration and its flurry of changes has created chaos; some of the measures have been reversed, while others are already facing litigation. But the tariffs against China are likely to stand, as Trump is keen on trying to maintain a competitive advantage in technology. Apple might end up having to raise prices and shift more of its manufacturing out of China - but it won't be alone among tech giants. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Therese Poletti </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
