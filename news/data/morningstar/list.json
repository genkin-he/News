(\"Nutex Health\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: NUTX), a physician-led, integrated healthcare delivery system comprised of 24 state-of-the-art micro-hospitals in 11 states and primary care-centric, risk-bearing physician networks, today provided an update regarding its strategic participation in arbitration known as the Independent Dispute Resolution (\"IDR\") process under the No Surprises Act (\"NSA\").</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">As previously disclosed in our <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">September 30, 2024</span> Form 10-Q, on <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">July 1, 2024</span> the Company contracted with a third-party vendor to assist in the recovery of certain out of network claims under the arbitration process. Since implementing its arbitration strategy, the Company has reached its goal of submitting between 60-70% of its billable visits to arbitration each month, achieving an arbitration success rate in excess of 80% during the fourth quarter of 2024.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">These increasingly favorable outcomes are expected to allow the Company to recover substantial amounts previously underpaid by insurers. Due to significant administrative time built into the federal arbitration process and delays in collections, the Company is now beginning to realize the full cash impact of its enhanced arbitration process that was commenced in <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">July 2024</span>.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Additionally, there is a significant cost to enter the arbitration process. The arbitration process includes expenses associated with third party providers, including independent dispute resolution entities, which typically collect fees at the beginning of the process, before the claim award amounts are decided by arbitrators.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\"Our proactive approach to arbitration under the No Surprises Act has yielded positive results thus far, reinforcing our commitment to fair reimbursement. By effectively leveraging our industry leading expertise and knowledge, we have been able to secure rightful payments for our facilities and providers while continuing to deliver high-quality, accessible care to our communities,\" stated <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Tom Vo</span>, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Nutex Health. \"The momentum we have built in 2024 places Nutex Health in a strong position for continued success in the coming year.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">The Company's arbitration success aligns with its broader strategic initiatives, which include optimizing hospital operations, expanding physician networks, and driving efficiencies across its integrated healthcare delivery model.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">The Company cannot predict whether arbitration successes and claim recovery will continue at current levels. Any significant revisions to the federal arbitration process may result in a substantial decrease in claim amounts recovered in the future. In addition, Nutex Health is unable to predict future regulatory changes, evolving arbitration practices, and payer responses to ongoing enforcement of the NSA, all of which may have an adverse impact on the Company's ability to recover on its claims.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">About Nutex Health Inc.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Headquartered in <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Houston, Texas</span>, and founded in 2011, Nutex Health Inc.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Brett Arends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Putting all your eggs in one basket is an especially bad idea now </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     At moments like this, I think of Doug Ramsey. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     He's the chief investment officer of Leuthold Group, a Midwestern money-management company. Ramsey has long been running a theoretical portfolio called \"All Asset No Authority.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Instead of going all in on the S&amp;P 500 SPX and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, which has been the Wall Street mania in recent years, this portfolio spreads its bets equally across what Ramsey considers to be the seven major asset classes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     That means three-sevenths of the money, or 43%, is invested in gold, commodity futures and Treasury bonds. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     And those all happened to keep their cool during the Trump tariff panic on Monday morning as the rest of the financial world wobbled. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Gold (GC00) jumped another $20 an ounce, hitting a fresh record of $2,855, after the Trump administration's weekend announcement of new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. Gold has risen more than 8% just since the start of the year and 900% since the start of the millennium. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, Treasury bills BX:TMUBMUSD03M and bonds BX:TMUBMUSD10Y held their value Monday, as did commodity futures - helped by a jump in oil prices. The iShares S&amp;P GSCI Commodity Indexed exchange-traded fund GSG, Invesco DB Commodity Index fund DBC and iShares Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Strategy ETF CMDY all edged into the black during morning trading that day. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     At the same time, the S&amp;P 500 index of large company stocks fell by nearly 1% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped by more than 1%. Small U.S. company stocks, as tracked by the Russell 2000 index RUT, also fell. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"The secular bull market in U.S. stocks since 2009 has been accompanied throughout by a secular bear market in diversification,\" Ramsey tells me. \"If U.S. large-cap stocks stall out over the next few years, many investors will find out just how dependent their returns have been on just a handful of stocks.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The All Asset No Authority portfolio idea may seem wild and off the wall, especially compared with conventional investment approaches. Most people invest their 401(k) plans, IRAs and other retirement accounts in stocks, along with bonds. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     But there is method to the madness. Bonds, gold and commodities in particular have provided diversification benefits in the past that investors haven't been able to get from stocks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Consider, for example, three long periods in the past century when investors in the S&amp;P 500 got completely hosed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     These were from 1937 to 1947, from 1965 to 1981 and from 2000 to 2012. On all three occasions, someone who invested $1 in the S&amp;P 500 at the start would have ended up with less than a dollar, after accounting for inflation, at the end. And that's before deducting investment fees and taxes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     But in all three cases, data from Dartmouth College finance professor Kenneth French show, someone who had bet on energy and commodities (using energy stocks as a proxy) actually made good money. During the first period, energy stocks earned you a total return of 45%. In the second, they doubled your money. In the third, they nearly tripled your money. Each of these calculations, incidentally, is in real terms, meaning after deducting for inflation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Legendary investor and stock-market contrarian Jeremy Grantham, founder of the white-shoe investment firm GMO in Boston, reported a year ago that since 1970, resource stocks, meaning those that invest in energy and in mining, have been \"far and away the most diversifying sector\" of the market. \"At longer horizons (10 years) resources are the only sector of the stock market to be negatively correlated with the broad stock market,\" he wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The data on gold is sketchier, because the price was effectively suppressed by the federal government from the 1930s to the early 1970s. But the price went up tenfold from 1969 to 1981 and nearly sixfold from 1999 to 2012, far outpacing inflation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Note that gold today is very expensive by historic measures. It has more than doubled in the past decade. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Meanwhile the data on Treasury bonds is mixed, because although they were terrific during the deflationary crash of 1929-32 that started the Great Depression and from 2000 to 2012, they were terrible during the inflationary stock-market slumps of the 1940s and 1970s. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     As for Treasury bills, generally referred to on Wall Street as \"cash\": They were a terrible investment during World War II and over the last decade, when the federal government suppressed short-term interest rates. But they held up well - and better than stocks - during other bear markets. They even kept up with inflation (just) during the bear market in stocks of the 1960s and 1970s. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Veteran financial consultant Andrew Smithers, author of the 2009 book \"Wall Street Revalued: Imperfect Markets and Inept Central Bankers,\" calculated that Treasury bills were a better diversifier to a stock portfolio than bonds. Warren Buffett has urged his heirs to keep 90% of his fortune in the S&amp;P 500 but 10% in Treasury bills. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Bulls like to argue that they don't need to diversify. The S&amp;P 500 has been such a great investment for so long, they can ignore everything else. But they are cherry-picking. They cheerfully cite data from the past 100 years to show that stocks outperform over the long run, but not data that show those same stocks often did very badly indeed, and for very long periods. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     So they will argue that the stock-market performance for the years and decades ahead will match its performance over the past 100 years - but only the good parts.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Vivien Lou Chen </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     'Investors are largely seeing through worrisome trade war headlines, which is entirely understandable,' says DataTrek Research's Colas </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     A measure of calm returned to financial markets on Tuesday as investors looked past the U.S. trade war with other countries, even as tensions continued to linger between the Trump administration and China.Financial markets were roiled on Monday by President Donald Trump's weekend announcement of 25% U.S. tariffs each on Mexico and Canada, along with an additional 10% tariff on China - which pulled all three major stock indexes to their lowest close in at least a week. Trump's announcement also pushed long-term Treasury yields to some of 2025's lowest closing levels.With Mexico and Canada tariffs now delayed for about a month, stocks DJIA SPX (COMP) moved higher in Tuesday trading. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY was down almost 0.9% at 108.06. And 10- BX:TMUBMUSD10Y to 30-year Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD30Y held relatively steady after having risen earlier in the day following China's retaliatory 10% and 15% tariffs on certain goods from the U.S., which go into effect next Monday.Read: The tariff wars aren't over. China hits back over new 10% tariffs.\"Investors are largely seeing through worrisome trade war headlines, which is entirely understandable,\" said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. \"Tariffs and trade wars thus far fail to meet the criteria of an actionable market shock,\" Colas wrote in a note on Tuesday. This criteria includes whether tariffs and trade wars would materially boost financial instability and the risk of a U.S. recession over the next 12 months. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Colas regards one popular measure of stock-market expectations for volatility, known as the CBOE Volatility Index or VIX VIX, as a \"reliable indicator of how much any negative news was not baked into\" stock prices. The index fell to as low as 16.89 on Tuesday, remaining below its long-run average of 19.5. Colas said his firm remains bullish on U.S. stocks, as long as trade wars don't trigger one of the criteria he has talked about. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Standard Bank's Steven Barrow, the London-based head of G-10 strategy, offered a different take. In a note, he said one of the numerous problems being created by Trump's volatile return to the White House is that \"financial markets could become unplayable.\" \"At this rate, the only beneficiary of the pretty chaotic start to President Trump's second term in office will be those with long-volatility positions,\" Barrow wrote. Following the dollar's whipsaw action on Monday, Barrow said he saw reasons to conclude that the greenback could be undermined going forward by a sense that Trump's tariffs can \"stick\" one moment and then get \"unstuck very quickly,\" and by markedly declining confidence in U.S. decision-making. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The fact that tariffs are being used as a negotiating tool by Trump has pushed uncertainty about U.S. trade policies to an all-time high, according to a team at BofA Global Research. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Some of the broad takeaways for market participants, according to the BofA team, are that: one, \"the U.S. administration is transactional, nothing is settled until it is final, \" and, two, \"U.S. economic policy threats must be taken seriously and literally.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Vivien Lou Chen </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Therese Poletti </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     In its earnings report Tuesday, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. did not break out a specific revenue number or forecast for its AI chips, as it had in recent quarters, a move that is bothering investors. History could prove that their concerns are valid. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Shares of AMD (AMD) fell 9% in after-hours trading, even though a few analysts had recently predicted the chip maker would stop providing guidance for its MI300 family of AI-focused graphics chips. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     When asked about the lack of specific guidance on the company's call with analysts, AMD Chief Executive Lisa Su was a bit disingenuous. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"I think what we look at is, certainly for the first year of the data center, GPU business,\" Su said. \"We wanted to give some clear progression as it was going - the business is now at scale, actually now at over $5 billion. And as we go into 2025, I think our guidance will be more at the segment level, with some color as to what's going on between the two businesses.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     In the previous quarter, AMD raised its 2024 guidance for AI graphics-chip revenue to exceeding $5 billion, up from a previous estimate of over $4.5 billion. But in its fourth-quarter results reported Tuesday, AMD's total data-center business - which includes AI graphics chips - had just $3.9 billion in revenue, missing Wall Street's expectations of $4.1 billion. That was still up 69% year over year, while total 2024 revenue was $12.6 billion. Company executives said both the data-center business and sales of AI GPUs should grow by strong double-digit percentages in 2025. But they were not more specific. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"AMD may be in a bit of a box, as we don't think the likely AI trajectory into 2025 can really support a solid guide, but the lack of a guide (the more likely scenario in our opinion) will also be taken negatively,\" said Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon, in a note to clients last week. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     AMD is transitioning to its next-generation AI GPUs. Rasgon noted that while the upcoming chips - AMD's MI325 and MI350 - appear to be competitive with Nvidia Corp.'s (NVDA) products, they are well behind timing-wise. Su said Tuesday that AMD would speed up the launch of the MI350 to the middle of this year, instead of a launching in the second half of 2025, an incremental positive. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Shares of AMD are down about 26% from last quarter, after reaching a high in 2024 of around $227, as investors got over-exuberant about the company's AI chips and expectations got too frothy. At one point, some bullish analysts had AI GPU revenue alone as high as $8 billion in 2024. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     It's worth pointing out one noteworthy example of a company that also stopped giving Wall Street a key earnings figure: Apple Inc. (AAPL) decided in 2018 to stop disclosing product unit sales, which it did right as iPhones were flattening from their once-torrid growth. It was the beginning of much slower growth for the iPhone. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     From 2018: When the going gets tough, Apple hides its numbers </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Granted, AMD does not have a long history of breaking out revenue for its AI GPU chips, or any other individual product lines. AMD, like many other chip and hardware companies, got caught up in the AI hype last year, and began breaking out its AI-specific revenue. But Wall Street does not like it when any metrics are suddenly taken away. And AMD is now paying the price, as the most optimistic of investors try to readjust their expectations. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Therese Poletti </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Brett Arends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Hard pass on this idea </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     President Donald Trump's proposal to create a multi-trillion-dollar U.S. sovereign-wealth fund, run by the government, isn't a bad idea. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     It's a full bingo card of bad ideas. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Where even to begin with this? Trump claims his fund would \"lessen the burden of taxes on American families and small businesses,\" but the opposite is true. This fund will increase the tax burden on the country, because it will be financed with taxpayers' dollars. That will be our money. And Trump has said it could be as much as $2 trillion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This isn't a tax cut, it's a tax hike. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     And what is this fund for? Trump said it would be \"to invest in great national endeavors for the benefit of all of the American people.\" This sounds like the famous scam during the South Sea Bubble 300 years ago, when a huckster gulled investors to buy stock in \"a company for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Good luck with that. \"Were not the fact stated by scores of credible witnesses,\" historian Charles Mackay later wrote, \"it would be impossible to believe that any person could have been duped by such a project.\" But duped they were. It showed, Mackay added, \"the utter madness of the people.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     It is no coincidence that most of the leading sovereign-wealth funds around the world are run by corrupt oligarchies, mostly in the Middle East and Asia, riddled with cronyism of the worst kind. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, Norway runs its own sovereign-wealth fund pretty much as an index fund to minimize the risks of cronyism and corruption. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The idea of creating an American fund raises a long list of unanswerable questions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Why, for example, would anyone think money would be invested more successfully by people in Washington than it would by private investors or fund managers? Why would they think such a fund would add any value? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Consider: Fund analyst company Morningstar lists about 350 U.S. mutual funds of significant size that have been around for at least 20 years. Of those, just eight seem to have outperformed a simple S&amp;P 500 SPX index fund over that period. That would be about 2%, give or take. (This doesn't even count the many funds that did so badly they closed, and dropped out of the screening.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     So what are the odds that political appointees in Washington will do so? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This is the point where I have to remind you that this is supposed to be a Republican administration. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Trump suggested Monday that this fund could use taxpayers' money to buy TikTok. No, I'm not kidding. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, there's another problem. Many of the countries that have created sovereign-wealth funds, most notably oil-rich Norway, have done so in order to handle their government surpluses. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     America doesn't have government surpluses. It has deficits. Massive, massive deficits, stretching as far into the distance as the Congressional Budget Office's eye can see. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The CBO reckons that U.S. national debt, already $29 trillion, is going to skyrocket to $52 trillion in just 10 years' time. That would be 118% of gross domestic product, an all-time high. Oh, and that's not even counting the effect of extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts, which would add an estimated $4.6 trillion to the debt. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     And this doesn't even include the tens of trillions of dollars that taxpayers are going to have to find to support Social Security and Medicare. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     If somehow the government is able to get hold of $2 trillion, they should be putting it toward the debt. Watching a bankrupt Uncle Sam get suckered into gambling his last nickels on a venture sold to him by a guy in a shiny tie from New York City sounds like something straight out of Mark Twain or O. Henry. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Hard pass. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Brett Arends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
