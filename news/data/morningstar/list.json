They say DeepSeek also will benefit chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO), Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Micron Technology (MU), while it will hurt Intel (INTC), due to the negative impact on server CPU demand. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The firm also expects a boost to the megacap technology giants Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL). \"We believe the broader Internet ecosystem should benefit from model advancements and improved cost efficiency. Lower costs should accelerate GenAI development and adoption, resulting in increased consumption,\" they said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Oracle (ORCL), however, may be hurt as the emergence of DeepSeek increases the likelihood of overbuilding on overly aggressive data-center plans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     As hyperscalers reaffirm capital spending plans, the power companies should benefit, the analysts added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     JPMorgan even pointed out healthcare technology companies could benefit if DeepSeek leads to a quicker pace of AI adoption. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Caterpillar (CAT), Cummins  (CMI) and Custom Truck One Source (CTOS) by contrast could be hurt if power generation and facility build-out gets delayed or scaled back. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Steve Goldstein </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\"><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb.  05, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Calibre (TSX: CXB; OTCQX: CXBMF) (“Calibre” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce additional ore control reverse circulation (“RC”) drill results from its Leprechaun open pit (“Leprechaun”) at Valentine Gold Mine (“Valentine”) in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The Company has completed 21,500 metres of RC drilling on a 9 x 9 metre spacing. The results of this drilling demonstrate 29% more ore tonnes at a 1% higher grade for 30% more gold than the comparable area in the 2022 Mineral Reserve model at an ore-waste cut-off of 0.38 g/t gold.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Darren Hall, President and Chief Executive Officer of Calibre, stated</strong>: “I am very encouraged to report that Calibre’s Leprechaun open pit ore control drilling confirms grade and adds tonnage resulting in a 30% increase in contained gold compared to the Mineral Reserve. Importantly, the grade distribution as seen in Table 1 indicates that applying a higher cut-off grade will result in processing higher grade material. At a 0.70 g/t cutoff, the reserve model estimated 660kt at 2.02 g/t whereas the ore control model, for a similar tonnage, results in 18% higher grade by increasing the cutoff to 1.0 g/t. This is an extremely positive result which could result in increased metal production while simultaneously extending mine life.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">I am also pleased to report that Valentine construction is going well, with strong progress on structural, mechanical, and piping activities in the grinding, reagents and gold room areas. Additionally, we have advanced pre commissioning at the crusher and various e-rooms. There are no changes to Valentine’s fully funded initial project capital cost of C$744 million and we remain on track to deliver first gold during Q2 2025.”</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\"

The comparison was carried out on 7.9 million tonnes of material extending from the current topography to bench 350 on blocks within 9 metres of RC drilling using 6 x 6 x 6 metre block sizes. For the 2022 Mineral Reserve Block Model, blocks flagged as Proven &amp; Probable are reported. For the Ore Control Block Model, a similar method was used to delineate ore vs. waste, respecting a minimum mining width of six metres and a minimum grade of 0.38 g/t gold. The RC drilling is a component of the Company’s standard mining approach.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-91967a64=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-91967a64=\"\"><source sizes=\"(max-width: 768w)\" srcset=\"https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/24cc48c9-5ab7-4921-8f32-5524d432e1cc/calibremining.jpg 1x,https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/24cc48c9-5ab7-4921-8f32-5524d432e1cc/calibremining.jpg 2x,https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/24cc48c9-5ab7-4921-8f32-5524d432e1cc/calibremining.jpg 3x\"><source sizes=\"(max-width: 1092w)\" srcset=\"https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/24cc48c9-5ab7-4921-8f32-5524d432e1cc/calibremining.jpg 1x,https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/24cc48c9-5ab7-4921-8f32-5524d432e1cc/calibremining.jpg 2x,https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/24cc48c9-5ab7-4921-8f32-5524d432e1cc/calibremining.jpg 3x\"><source sizes=\"(max-width: 600w)\" srcset=\"https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/24cc48c9-5ab7-4921-8f32-5524d432e1cc/calibremining.jpg 1x,https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/24cc48c9-5ab7-4921-8f32-5524d432e1cc/calibremining.jpg 2x,https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/24cc48c9-5ab7-4921-8f32-5524d432e1cc/calibremining.jpg 3x\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/24cc48c9-5ab7-4921-8f32-5524d432e1cc/calibremining.jpg\"/></source></source></source></picture></span><br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/></p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\"><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">Footnotes:</em></strong></p> <ol class=\"mdc-article-list mdc-article-list--ordered\" data-v-6f730619=\"\"><li data-v-6f730619=\"\"><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">Refer to the “Valentine Gold Project NI 43-101 Technical Report and Feasibility Study, Newfoundland &amp; Labrador, Canada” dated November 30, 2022 and found on the Calibre website at </em><a class=\"mdc-link mds-link mdc-link--body\" data-v-4234e9e2=\"\" href=\"http://www.calibremining.com/\" tabindex=\"0\"><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">www.calibremining.com </em></a><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">and on SEDAR+ at </em><a class=\"mdc-link mds-link mdc-link--body\" data-v-4234e9e2=\"\" href=\"http://www.sedarplus.ca/\" tabindex=\"0\"><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">www.sedarplus.ca </em></a><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">.</em><br data-v-6f730619=\"\"/></li></ol> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Quality Assurance/Quality Control</strong><br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/>QA/QC protocols followed at the Valentine Gold Mine for the RC ore control drilling include the insertion of blanks and standards at regular intervals in each sample batch.

(\"Nutex Health\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: NUTX), a physician-led, integrated healthcare delivery system comprised of 24 state-of-the-art micro-hospitals in 11 states and primary care-centric, risk-bearing physician networks, today provided an update regarding its strategic participation in arbitration known as the Independent Dispute Resolution (\"IDR\") process under the No Surprises Act (\"NSA\").</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">As previously disclosed in our <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">September 30, 2024</span> Form 10-Q, on <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">July 1, 2024</span> the Company contracted with a third-party vendor to assist in the recovery of certain out of network claims under the arbitration process. Since implementing its arbitration strategy, the Company has reached its goal of submitting between 60-70% of its billable visits to arbitration each month, achieving an arbitration success rate in excess of 80% during the fourth quarter of 2024.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">These increasingly favorable outcomes are expected to allow the Company to recover substantial amounts previously underpaid by insurers. Due to significant administrative time built into the federal arbitration process and delays in collections, the Company is now beginning to realize the full cash impact of its enhanced arbitration process that was commenced in <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">July 2024</span>.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Additionally, there is a significant cost to enter the arbitration process. The arbitration process includes expenses associated with third party providers, including independent dispute resolution entities, which typically collect fees at the beginning of the process, before the claim award amounts are decided by arbitrators.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\"Our proactive approach to arbitration under the No Surprises Act has yielded positive results thus far, reinforcing our commitment to fair reimbursement. By effectively leveraging our industry leading expertise and knowledge, we have been able to secure rightful payments for our facilities and providers while continuing to deliver high-quality, accessible care to our communities,\" stated <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Tom Vo</span>, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Nutex Health. \"The momentum we have built in 2024 places Nutex Health in a strong position for continued success in the coming year.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">The Company's arbitration success aligns with its broader strategic initiatives, which include optimizing hospital operations, expanding physician networks, and driving efficiencies across its integrated healthcare delivery model.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">The Company cannot predict whether arbitration successes and claim recovery will continue at current levels. Any significant revisions to the federal arbitration process may result in a substantial decrease in claim amounts recovered in the future. In addition, Nutex Health is unable to predict future regulatory changes, evolving arbitration practices, and payer responses to ongoing enforcement of the NSA, all of which may have an adverse impact on the Company's ability to recover on its claims.</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">About Nutex Health Inc.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Headquartered in <span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">Houston, Texas</span>, and founded in 2011, Nutex Health Inc.

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Brett Arends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Putting all your eggs in one basket is an especially bad idea now </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     At moments like this, I think of Doug Ramsey. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     He's the chief investment officer of Leuthold Group, a Midwestern money-management company. Ramsey has long been running a theoretical portfolio called \"All Asset No Authority.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Instead of going all in on the S&amp;P 500 SPX and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, which has been the Wall Street mania in recent years, this portfolio spreads its bets equally across what Ramsey considers to be the seven major asset classes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     That means three-sevenths of the money, or 43%, is invested in gold, commodity futures and Treasury bonds. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     And those all happened to keep their cool during the Trump tariff panic on Monday morning as the rest of the financial world wobbled. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Gold (GC00) jumped another $20 an ounce, hitting a fresh record of $2,855, after the Trump administration's weekend announcement of new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. Gold has risen more than 8% just since the start of the year and 900% since the start of the millennium. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, Treasury bills BX:TMUBMUSD03M and bonds BX:TMUBMUSD10Y held their value Monday, as did commodity futures - helped by a jump in oil prices. The iShares S&amp;P GSCI Commodity Indexed exchange-traded fund GSG, Invesco DB Commodity Index fund DBC and iShares Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Strategy ETF CMDY all edged into the black during morning trading that day. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     At the same time, the S&amp;P 500 index of large company stocks fell by nearly 1% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped by more than 1%. Small U.S. company stocks, as tracked by the Russell 2000 index RUT, also fell. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"The secular bull market in U.S. stocks since 2009 has been accompanied throughout by a secular bear market in diversification,\" Ramsey tells me. \"If U.S. large-cap stocks stall out over the next few years, many investors will find out just how dependent their returns have been on just a handful of stocks.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The All Asset No Authority portfolio idea may seem wild and off the wall, especially compared with conventional investment approaches. Most people invest their 401(k) plans, IRAs and other retirement accounts in stocks, along with bonds. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     But there is method to the madness. Bonds, gold and commodities in particular have provided diversification benefits in the past that investors haven't been able to get from stocks. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Consider, for example, three long periods in the past century when investors in the S&amp;P 500 got completely hosed. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     These were from 1937 to 1947, from 1965 to 1981 and from 2000 to 2012. On all three occasions, someone who invested $1 in the S&amp;P 500 at the start would have ended up with less than a dollar, after accounting for inflation, at the end. And that's before deducting investment fees and taxes. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     But in all three cases, data from Dartmouth College finance professor Kenneth French show, someone who had bet on energy and commodities (using energy stocks as a proxy) actually made good money. During the first period, energy stocks earned you a total return of 45%. In the second, they doubled your money. In the third, they nearly tripled your money. Each of these calculations, incidentally, is in real terms, meaning after deducting for inflation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Legendary investor and stock-market contrarian Jeremy Grantham, founder of the white-shoe investment firm GMO in Boston, reported a year ago that since 1970, resource stocks, meaning those that invest in energy and in mining, have been \"far and away the most diversifying sector\" of the market. \"At longer horizons (10 years) resources are the only sector of the stock market to be negatively correlated with the broad stock market,\" he wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The data on gold is sketchier, because the price was effectively suppressed by the federal government from the 1930s to the early 1970s. But the price went up tenfold from 1969 to 1981 and nearly sixfold from 1999 to 2012, far outpacing inflation. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Note that gold today is very expensive by historic measures. It has more than doubled in the past decade. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Meanwhile the data on Treasury bonds is mixed, because although they were terrific during the deflationary crash of 1929-32 that started the Great Depression and from 2000 to 2012, they were terrible during the inflationary stock-market slumps of the 1940s and 1970s. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     As for Treasury bills, generally referred to on Wall Street as \"cash\": They were a terrible investment during World War II and over the last decade, when the federal government suppressed short-term interest rates. But they held up well - and better than stocks - during other bear markets. They even kept up with inflation (just) during the bear market in stocks of the 1960s and 1970s. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Veteran financial consultant Andrew Smithers, author of the 2009 book \"Wall Street Revalued: Imperfect Markets and Inept Central Bankers,\" calculated that Treasury bills were a better diversifier to a stock portfolio than bonds. Warren Buffett has urged his heirs to keep 90% of his fortune in the S&amp;P 500 but 10% in Treasury bills. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Bulls like to argue that they don't need to diversify. The S&amp;P 500 has been such a great investment for so long, they can ignore everything else. But they are cherry-picking. They cheerfully cite data from the past 100 years to show that stocks outperform over the long run, but not data that show those same stocks often did very badly indeed, and for very long periods. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     So they will argue that the stock-market performance for the years and decades ahead will match its performance over the past 100 years - but only the good parts. The garden will bloom every spring and summer, but winters will never come. Maybe they're right. Then again, maybe not. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Brett Arends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
