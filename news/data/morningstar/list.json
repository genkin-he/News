A U.S. official said that Trump and Xi could speak on Wednesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Trump has called the China tariffs \"an opening salvo\" and indicated that the U.S. will levy substantial tariffs against China if the countries can't come to an agreement. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Earlier Wednesday, the U.S. Postal Service said it would stop accepting parcels from China and Hong Kong, cutting off a service that is popular with online vendors in China. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Goldman Sachs analysts said that China's retaliatory tariffs appear much less than proportional compared with the U.S.'s 10% across-the-board additional tariff on $525 billion worth of Chinese goods. In the coming days, the U.S.'s reactions to China's retaliation will be among the key events to watch. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Forex: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The euro has limited scope to recover even as hopes rise that the EU can avert threatened U.S. trade tariffs after President Trump postponed a levy on Canadian and Mexican imports, ING's Francesco Pesole said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Trump's decision to delay tariffs on his U.S. neighbors could reflect domestic backlash over potential economic pain for U.S. consumers but the same isn't necessarily true for the EU, he said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Trump can afford to keep EU tariffs in place for a prolonged period, making the bloc feel some pain before striking a deal. \"With all this in mind, we are somewhat skeptical that the euro is bound for a major rally.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Bonds: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Supply of covered bonds by European banks is expected to decline in 2025, partly due to weak economic growth, ING's Marine Leleux said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  ING expects the supply of euro-denominated covered bonds to drop by 7 billion euros, equivalent to $7.24 billion, this year versus 2024. A high number of redemptions due this year could mean bond refinancing dominates covered-bond supply this year, she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Energy: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Oil prices were lower after the U.S. implemented an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports and Beijing retaliated with measures of its own, raising concerns over the prospects for demand. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Near-term prices for global crude oil could remain capped due to supply risks and potential trade challenges, said Hassan Fawaz, GivTrade's chairman and founder. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Trade tensions between the U.S. and China may also affect demand levels, he said, adding that caution could dominate, leading to pressure on oil prices. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Oil traders have also been concerned about plans by OPEC+, to boost production after the first quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Metals: </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Gold edged higher early Wednesday. Demand for haven assets like gold, which is testing record highs, was being boosted by uncertainty in a challenging global economic environment dominated by trade and tariff tensions between the U.S. and multiple nations, Pepperstone said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  U.S. job openings at the end of 2024 unexpectedly resumed their downward trend, which raises questions about the labor market's strength and its ability to withstand global economic risks, raising uncertainty for investors, it added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  -- </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Base metals were broadly higher in Asia. China on Tuesday announced export restrictions on metals for various industries in retaliation to U.S. tariffs, but the list didn't include base metals, which supports the positive sentiment, Sucden Financial said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Given the moderate tariff increases from China and the U.S., markets are weighing the potential impact on both economies, which may be minimal provided that the situation doesn't escalate further, it added. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  -- </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Iron ore declined, dragged by concerns over the tariffs China announced Tuesday. China imposed a 15% tariff on imports of U.S. coking coal, ANZ Research analysts said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Chinese iron-ore markets will probably come under pressure amid worries about weaker export-driven demand, the analysts added. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\">   \n \n </pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  TODAY'S TOP HEADLINES </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Fed's Daly Is in No Rush to Cut Interest Rates </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The Federal Reserve's Mary Daly is in no rush to lower interest rates until inflation is closing in on the central bank's 2% target. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  A solid economic backdrop gives the Fed the luxury of time to hold policy where it is until disinflation progress resumes, the San Francisco Fed President said on Tuesday. \"[The economy] came into 2025 in a very good place,\" Daly said at an event hosted by the Commonwealth Club World Affairs of California. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\">   \n \n </pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Fed Vice Chair Jefferson Urges Patience on Rate Cuts </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  A solid economy and still-too-high inflation argue for holding interest rates steady until more progress is made in slowing price growth, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson said on Tuesday evening, echoing recent remarks from several of his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  \"As long as the economy and labor market remain strong, I see it as appropriate for the Committee to be cautious in making further adjustments,\" Jefferson said in prepared remarks for an address at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., on Tuesday evening. \"Over the medium term, I continue to see a gradual reduction in the level of monetary policy restraint placed on the economy as we move toward a more neutral stance as the most likely outcome.\" </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\">   \n \n </pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Novo Nordisk Earnings Must Show GLP-1 Market Still Set for Big Growth </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  When Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk reports its quarterly financial results on Wednesday, investors will be looking for reassurance the GLP-1 market is still on track for the enormous growth Wall Street expects. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Novo shares have taken a beating in recent months, with the stock's American depositary receipts falling nearly 40% in the last six months of 2024.

Ukraine is on board, but putting the plan into practice might not be so easy: Many of the minerals of greatest interest to the U.S. are in areas under Russian occupation or threatened by Moscow's advance. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  As a result, access to valuable Ukrainian natural resources will depend, at least in part, on the battle for eastern Ukraine, where Russian forces are currently advancing slowly but steadily. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\">   \n \n </pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Nissan to Reject Honda's Merger Terms, Putting Deal in Peril </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Nissan's board is planning to reject Honda's terms for a combination of the two automakers, putting in danger a merger plan announced less than two months ago, people familiar with the matter said Wednesday. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Nissan's board was scheduled to meet later Wednesday, and the people cautioned that no final decision to kill the deal has been made. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\">   \n \n </pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Write to singaporeeditors@dowjones.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\">   \n \n </pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Expected Major Events for Wednesday </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  07:00/DEN: 4Q Consumer credit </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  07:45/FRA: Dec Industrial production index </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  08:00/CZE: Dec Retail trade </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  08:15/SPN: Jan Spain Services PMI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  08:30/EU: Jan EuroCOIN indicator of euro area economic activity </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  08:45/ITA: Jan Italy Services PMI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  08:50/FRA: Jan France Services PMI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  08:55/GER: Jan Germany Services PMI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  09:00/EU: Jan Eurozone Services PMI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  09:00/UK: Jan UK monthly car registrations figures </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  09:00/ITA: Dec Retail Sales </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  09:30/UK: Jan S&amp;P Global UK Services PMI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  09:30/UK: Jan UK Official Reserves </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  09:30/UK: Jan Narrow money (Notes &amp; Coin) and reserve balances </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  10:00/EU: Dec PPI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  10:00/CYP: Jan Registered Unemployed </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  10:00/LUX: Jan CPI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  11:00/FRA: Dec OECD CPI </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  11:00/POR: 4Q Employment statistics </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  16:59/POL: Polish interest rate decision </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  All times in GMT.

That beat the estimate of Y1.175 trillion in a poll of analysts by data provider Quick. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Third-quarter revenue rose 2.9% to Y12.391 trillion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  For the fiscal year ending March, Toyota now expects net profit to decline 8.6% to Y4.520 trillion and revenue to increase 4.2% to Y47.000 trillion.

The opportunities for marketers to drive meaningful engagement have never been broader, but the complexity of digital and social media - evident in our 630+ page report - means there’s no single route to success.
