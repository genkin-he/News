            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Brett Arends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Hard pass on this idea </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     President Donald Trump's proposal to create a multi-trillion-dollar U.S. sovereign-wealth fund, run by the government, isn't a bad idea. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     It's a full bingo card of bad ideas. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Where even to begin with this? Trump claims his fund would \"lessen the burden of taxes on American families and small businesses,\" but the opposite is true. This fund will increase the tax burden on the country, because it will be financed with taxpayers' dollars. That will be our money. And Trump has said it could be as much as $2 trillion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This isn't a tax cut, it's a tax hike. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     And what is this fund for? Trump said it would be \"to invest in great national endeavors for the benefit of all of the American people.\" This sounds like the famous scam during the South Sea Bubble 300 years ago, when a huckster gulled investors to buy stock in \"a company for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Good luck with that. \"Were not the fact stated by scores of credible witnesses,\" historian Charles Mackay later wrote, \"it would be impossible to believe that any person could have been duped by such a project.\" But duped they were. It showed, Mackay added, \"the utter madness of the people.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     It is no coincidence that most of the leading sovereign-wealth funds around the world are run by corrupt oligarchies, mostly in the Middle East and Asia, riddled with cronyism of the worst kind. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, Norway runs its own sovereign-wealth fund pretty much as an index fund to minimize the risks of cronyism and corruption. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The idea of creating an American fund raises a long list of unanswerable questions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Why, for example, would anyone think money would be invested more successfully by people in Washington than it would by private investors or fund managers? Why would they think such a fund would add any value? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Consider: Fund analyst company Morningstar lists about 350 U.S. mutual funds of significant size that have been around for at least 20 years. Of those, just eight seem to have outperformed a simple S&amp;P 500 SPX index fund over that period. That would be about 2%, give or take. (This doesn't even count the many funds that did so badly they closed, and dropped out of the screening.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     So what are the odds that political appointees in Washington will do so? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This is the point where I have to remind you that this is supposed to be a Republican administration. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Trump suggested Monday that this fund could use taxpayers' money to buy TikTok. No, I'm not kidding. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, there's another problem. Many of the countries that have created sovereign-wealth funds, most notably oil-rich Norway, have done so in order to handle their government surpluses. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     America doesn't have government surpluses. It has deficits. Massive, massive deficits, stretching as far into the distance as the Congressional Budget Office's eye can see. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The CBO reckons that U.S. national debt, already $29 trillion, is going to skyrocket to $52 trillion in just 10 years' time. That would be 118% of gross domestic product, an all-time high. Oh, and that's not even counting the effect of extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts, which would add an estimated $4.6 trillion to the debt. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     And this doesn't even include the tens of trillions of dollars that taxpayers are going to have to find to support Social Security and Medicare. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     If somehow the government is able to get hold of $2 trillion, they should be putting it toward the debt.

The real estate industry’s slick handling of campaign cash comes as no surprise.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n“AIDS Healthcare Foundation and Housing Is A Human Right have battled corporate landlords for years,” says Housing Is A Human Right Policy Director Susie Shannon, “and we know all too well that Californians can never trust Big Real Estate. Corporate landlords and their front group, the California Apartment Association, will do anything to keep charging outrageous rents and grow outsized profits – no matter the consequences to the poor and middle and working class.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nIn 2024, AHF and Housing Is A Human Right sponsored Proposition 33, which aimed to repeal statewide rent control restrictions and urgently address California’s housing affordability and homelessness crises. Prop 33 would have allowed cities to pass updated rent control policies and finally rein in predatory landlords – widespread rent gouging after the L.A. wildfires, for example, would have been largely prevented with new rent regulations.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nBut corporate landlords and the California Apartment Association raised $135.8 million to not only kill Prop 33, but to also pass Prop 34. The latter initiative sought to stop AHF from using certain money for its housing advocacy work. In November 2024, Big Real Estate successfully defeated Prop 33 and barely passed Prop 34.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n<em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">(Read: </em><a class=\"mdc-link mds-link mdc-link--body\" data-v-4234e9e2=\"\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40patrickrangemcdonald%2Fspecial-report-california-apartment-associations-big-money-schemes-to-kill-prop-33-and-pass-prop-d5df10bf9745&amp;esheet=54199869&amp;newsitemid=20250204942269&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=%26%238220%3BSpecial+Report%3A+California+Apartment+Association%26%238217%3Bs+Big-Money+Schemes+to+Kill+Prop+33+and+Pass+Prop+34.%26%238221%3B&amp;index=3&amp;md5=406c1c7985a1482ce270618ead569f3c\" tabindex=\"0\"><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">“Special Report: California Apartment Association’s Big-Money Schemes to Kill Prop 33 and Pass Prop 34.”</em></a><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">)</em>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nBoth the CAA’s No on Prop 33 and Yes on Prop 34 campaigns were funded by the California Apartment Association Issues Committee, and that’s where the shady contributions were delivered.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nBetween 2023 and 2024, Housing Is A Human Right found that 13 separate contributions were made to the California Apartment Association Issues Committee by corporate entities that were controlled by the same company, Rafanelli &amp; Nahas, a corporate landlord based in Lafayette, California. Those contributions added up to a significant total: $177,150.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nBy delivering campaign cash that way, Rafanelli &amp; Nahas were essentially trying to pull a fast one over the public – rather than have Rafanelli &amp; Nahas’ name attached to the 13 contributions, the names of its corporate entities were linked. For example, Amador Lakes III, LP, operated by Rafanelli &amp; Nahas, sent three contributions totaling $50,250 to the California Apartment Association Issues Committee. State law says the corporate landlord can’t do that – the public should know exactly who’s delivering campaign cash and how much is coming from that single contributor.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nIn addition, Housing Is A Human Right and AHF made the case that the California Apartment Association should have been aware that Rafanelli &amp; Nahas was trying to pull a fast one and not allowed the corporate landlord to file its campaign contributions in such an underhanded way.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nOn February 4, the California Fair Political Practices Commission informed AHF and Housing Is A Human Right that it will be investigating the matter further.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n“AHF and Housing Is A Human Right have always been about holding the California Apartment Association and corporate landlords accountable,” says Susie Shannon. “We’re very pleased that the FPPC has decided to look into this serious abuse of voter trust.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-91967a64=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-91967a64=\"\"><source sizes=\"(max-width: 768w)\" srcset=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250204942269r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 1x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250204942269r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 2x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250204942269r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 3x\"><source sizes=\"(max-width: 1092w)\" srcset=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250204942269r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 1x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250204942269r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 2x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250204942269r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 3x\"><source sizes=\"(max-width: 600w)\" srcset=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250204942269r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 1x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250204942269r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 2x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250204942269r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 3x\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250204942269r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en\"/></source></source></source></picture></span><span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"></span></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Press Contact: \n</strong><br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/>Ged Kenslea, AHF Senior Director of Communications\n<br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/>323.791.5526\n<br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/><a class=\"mdc-link mds-link mdc-link--body\" data-v-4234e9e2=\"\" href=\"mailto:ged.kenslea@ahf.org\" tabindex=\"0\">ged.kenslea@ahf.org</a>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">View source version on businesswire.com: </span><span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><a class=\"mdc-link mds-link mdc-link--body\" data-v-4234e9e2=\"\" href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250204942269/en/\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250204942269/en/</a></span></p></div>",

The action is brought on behalf of all persons or entities that purchased GSK American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) between February 5, 2020, and August 14, 2022, inclusive (the “Class Period”).\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nBLB&amp;G filed this action on behalf of its client, Roofers Local No. 149 Pension Fund, and the case is captioned <em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">Roofers Local No. 149 Pension Fund v.

In the 1980s, a predecessor company to GSK launched a treatment for heartburn and acid reflux: ranitidine, under the brand name Zantac. Over the next four decades, Zantac was used by millions of patients and generated billions of dollars for GSK. In 2019, independent laboratory Valisure found NDMA, a cancer-causing poison, in “every batch of every [Zantac] medication” that it tested. Valisure reported these results to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and to the public. In September and October 2019, GSK suspended its distribution of Zantac and initiated a voluntary recall. In April 2020, the FDA requested that manufacturers cease selling Zantac and any generic alternatives. Tens of thousands of cancer-stricken patients filed personal injury and product liability lawsuits against GSK in the years that followed. Many of these were unified into a multidistrict litigation proceeding.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nThe complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants represented to investors that GSK removed Zantac from the market “[b]ased on information available at the time and correspondence with regulators,” and that GSK was “continuing with investigations into the potential source of NDMA.” Defendants also assured investors that “GSK, the FDA, and the EMA [European Medicines Agency] have all independently concluded that there is no evidence of a causal association between ranitidine therapy and the development of cancer in patients,” findings that were “consistent with other ranitidine data published prior to 2019.” Finally, Defendants claimed that they could not “quantify or reliably estimate the liability” GSK could face from Zantac-related legal proceedings.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nThese representations were materially false or misleading and caused GSK ADRs to trade at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period. In truth, GSK was fully aware of the source of NDMA and had been for nearly 40 years before withdrawing Zantac from the market. Furthermore, Defendants’ representations about their ability to “quantify or reliably estimate the liability” deceived investors, who did not know that GSK had for decades concealed an internal study that implicated the Company’s liability to Zantac users.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nThe truth began to emerge on August 10, 2022, when a Deutsche Bank report alerted the market that it seemed “very possible” that GSK and other Zantac distributors “will incur the risk of some degree of shared liability, with the only real questions being what the magnitude of liability may be.” While GSK had repeatedly told investors that scientific research did not support a correlation between Zantac and cancer, the Deutsche Bank report forecasted that total liability could be between $5 billion and $10 billion. Then, on August 15, 2022, GSK admitted that it could, in fact, provide guidance and that its liability exposure was between $1 billion and $10 billion. As a result of these disclosures, the price of GSK ADRs declined precipitously.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nIf you wish to serve as Lead Plaintiff for the Class, you must file a motion with the Court no later than April 7, 2025, which is the first business day on which the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania is open that is 60 days after the publication date of February 4, 2025. Any member of the proposed Class may seek to serve as Lead Plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain a member of the proposed Class.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nIf you wish to discuss this action or have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests, please contact Scott R.

Investors might be disappointed by the source of the beat and what it says about momentum for AMD (AMD) in the data center. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     While AMD's data-center business rose 69% to a record $3.9 billion for the latest quarter, that wasn't enough to clear Wall Street's bar. Analysts tracked by FactSet had been projecting $4.1 billion. The data-center unit also includes revenue from traditional sources unrelated to AI. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Analysts had been growing more concerned about AMD's data-center trajectory ahead of the report. Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso lowered his AI revenue expectations last month, saying he expected about $7 billion in revenue from that part of the business this year. He previously was modeling at least $10 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     See also: AMD's stock downgraded yet again: 'Believe it or not, it's not due to DeepSeek' </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     AMD didn't offer a forecast for 2025 AI revenue in its latest release. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Chief Executive Lisa Su said in prepared remarks posted to the company's site that its recent progress \"places AMD on a steep long-term growth trajectory, led by the rapid scaling of our data-center AI franchise from more than $5 billion of revenue in 2024 to tens of billions of dollars of annual revenue over the coming years.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The company is \"on track to accelerate production shipments tomid-year\" for its MI350 chip, the next generation of AMD's AI line. Management was previously targeting the second half of the year, according to Su. The change \"improves our relative competitiveness,\" she said on the earnings call. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     AMD also cheered developments related to DeepSeek, the Chinese AI startup, and Stargate, the U.S. joint venture focused on AI infrastructure. \"All of these initiatives require massive amounts of new compute and create unprecedented growth opportunities for AMD across our businesses,\" Su said in the prepared comments. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     For the latest quarter, the big source of upside was revenue from its client business, which includes personal computers. Sales there rose 58% to $2.3 billion. The FactSet consensus was for $1.9 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The gaming and embedded businesses both saw drops in revenue, reflecting sustained pressures there. Gaming revenue was down 59% to $563 million, with AMD noting a drop in semi-custom sales. And the company pointed to \"mixed\" end-market demand for its embedded unit, which saw revenue fall 13% to $923 million. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Overall, AMD delivered $7.7 billion in revenue versus the $7.5 billion consensus view. And the company is looking for $7.1 billion in revenue during the current quarter, based on the midpoint of its guidance range. Analysts tracked by FactSet had been modeling $7.0 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"Looking into 2025, we see clear opportunities for continued growth based on the strength of our product portfolio and growing demand for high-performance and adaptive computing,\" Su said in a release. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Emily Bary </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

And it said it expects 2025 to be a better year for Barbie, after 2024 faced a higher bar to clear due to the boost it got in 2023 by the blockbuster film based on the iconic doll. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     And as it tries to turn more of its classic toys into films, shows, games and other content, management said it expects Mattel (MAT) to become a bigger entertainment company. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"We believe Mattel is well-positioned to increase market share in our entertainment business in 2025,\" Chief Executive Ynon Kreiz said on Mattel's earnings call. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"We expect progress to continue on our two films in production and 14 announced films in development,\" he continued. \"More shows to launch on Netflix, including 'Hot Wheels Let's Race' Season 3, Barbie's next animated special, and new seasons of 'Thomas &amp; Friends' and 'Polly Pocket.'\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Shares were up 10.3% after hours. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The company said it expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.66 to $1.72 for 2025. That forecast was above FactSet estimates for $1.57. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The outlook, Mattel said, factored in \"the anticipated impact of new U.S. tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada imports announced on February 1st,\" as well as actions the company planned to take to address the new duties, some of which have been put on hold for at least 30 days. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Those actions, Mattel said, included \"leveraging the strength of our supply chain.\" But the company said its response could include actions related to \"potential pricing.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Trump over the weekend said the U.S. would put 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, with a 10% additional tariff on imports from China. Energy from Canada would be taxed at 10%. Mexico and Canada on Monday worked out deals to keep those tariffs from taking hold for roughly another month. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Economists have said that Trump's tariffs - intended to extract concessions on trade and other issues from other nations - will likely prompt businesses to raise prices to some degree, as they pass on the extra costs of those import taxes on to shoppers. Those shoppers have already been dealing with three years of higher costs of living, which has weighed on demand for items like toys. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     UBS analysts have said that Mattel and its rival Hasbro Inc. (HAS) weren't as vulnerable to tariffs as some of their rivals, as they had less exposure to China. UBS analyst Arpine Kocharyan said in October that the toy industry overall had \"80% exposure to?China.\" Around 50% of Mattel's products are made in China, she said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     For the fourth quarter, Mattel reported $1.65 billion in sales, up 2%. Adjusted earnings per share were 35 cents. Both were above FactSet forecasts. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Overall, Mattel saw an increase in gross billings, a gauge of what retail stores buy from the company, in North America and internationally. But for dolls, mainly Barbie dolls, they fell. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Ahead of Tuesday's results, Kocharyan said that despite a possible slowdown from the shorter traditional holiday shopping season - from Thanksgiving through Christmas - there was room for optimism for the period. She said the weaker showing from Barbie had already been appropriately telegraphed by the company and understood by Wall Street. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"Barbie declines are expected and in guidance,\" she said in a note on Monday. \"Overall, Mattel saw strength in Hot Wheels and in dolls driven by 'Moana' theatrical release in Q4.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Bill Peters </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
