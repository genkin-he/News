            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Joshua Kirby </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Hiring in the private sector picked up pace at the start of the year, suggesting the jobs market remains tight. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Private businesses added 183,000 jobs in January, up from 176,000 in December, according to the ADP National Employment report released Wednesday. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had expected 150,000 new jobs in January. The total for December was revised upward, pointing to better-than-estimated momentum at the end of last year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Still, strength in jobs in consumer-facing industries like hospitality masked weakness elsewhere, said Nela Richardson, ADP's chief economist. Manufacturing jobs decreased by 13,000 over the month, while areas like construction added a few jobs. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  \"We had a strong start to 2025 but it masked a dichotomy in the labor market,\" Richardson said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Pay growth for those staying in their jobs was meanwhile stable on the month, but for job-changers the average increase accelerated. That will likely add to caution among Federal Reserve policymakers still wary of upward pressure on consumer prices from robust pay packets. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Signs of strength in hiring contrast with figures showing more workers are staying in their jobs as prospects cool for a better position elsewhere. Americans quit 39.6 million jobs in 2024, down 11% from the year before and down 22% from a recent peak in 2022, according to Labor Department data published this week. The share of employees who quit their jobs each month has fallen below the prepandemic level, and some economists expect more decreases ahead. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Write to Joshua Kirby at joshua.kirby@wsj.com; @joshualeokirby </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  February 05, 2025 08:52 ET (13:52 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By Adria Calatayud </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Banco Santander said it plans to buy back 10 billion euros ($10.38 billion) of its own stock after it reported fourth-quarter results that exceeded expectations, sending shares sharply higher. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Spain's biggest lender by assets became the latest bank in Europe to outline plans for bumper returns to shareholders. European banks took steps to clean up their balance sheets and restore profitability amid high interest rates in recent years and have continued to hand money back to shareholders even as central banks moved to lower rates. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Santander said Wednesday that it expects to return 10 billion euros to shareholders through stock repurchases from its earnings this year and next on top of its dividend. Its plans came hot on the heels of buyback announcements on Tuesday from UBS Group, Intesa Sanpaolo and BNP Paribas. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The news sent the stock up, rising 7% higher in European afternoon trade to levels last seen in 2018. The jump made Santander the biggest bank of the eurozone by market capitalization with a value topping 80 billion euros, overtaking BNP Paribas and Intesa Sanpaolo. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The bank said it plans to start a new buyback program of about 1.59 billion euros on Thursday for which it already obtained regulatory authorization. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Santander said it was confident it would be able to boost profitability again in 2025, raising a key profitability target despite projecting broadly stable revenue for the year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Net profit for the fourth quarter was 3.265 billion euros, up 11% on year, Santander said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Total income for the quarter rose 10% to 16.03 billion euros, mainly driven by higher net fee income. Net interest income--the difference between what a bank earns on loans and what it pays clients for deposits--came to 11.99 billion euros, up 6.8% on the prior quarter. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Analysts had expected Santander to post a net profit of 2.95 billion euros on revenue of 15.39 billion euros, according to consensus estimates provided by Visible Alpha. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The bank attributed the profit rise to increases at its main income streams that offset higher costs and a hit from a U.K. provision to cover potential costs from a court ruling on the disclosure of dealer commissions on car loans. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  For 2025, Santander expects revenue of about 62 billion euros, mid-high single digit growth in net fee income, lower costs and a return on tangible equity--a key profitability metric for banks--of more than 17%. It had previously targeted a 2025 return on tangible equity of 15% to 17%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Santander executive chair, Ana Botin, said in a call with analysts she expected a challenging environment in 2025, but that the bank's progress toward its 2025 targets put it well ahead of plan. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  \"Our track record shows that in a challenging market we outperform peers and in 2025 we expect to grow our bottom line and profitability--with revenue stable and costs falling,\" Botin said. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The bank's full-year revenue climbed 7.9% to 61.88 billion euros in 2024 and its return on tangible equity for the year stood at 16.3%, up from 15.1% a year before. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Write to Adria Calatayud at adria.calatayud@wsj.com </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\"></pre>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  February 05, 2025 08:41 ET (13:41 GMT)</p>\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mdc-article-body\">\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  By James Rogers </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The high-interest rate environment has impacted consumer confidence, according to Harley-Davidson CEO Jochen Zeitz </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Harley-Davidson Inc.'s stock was down 3.1% in premarket trading Wednesday after the iconic motorbike maker reported a worse-than-expected fourth-quarter loss. The company's chief executive Jochen Zeitz said that the high-interest rate environment has impacted consumer confidence. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The Milwaukee-based company had a net loss of $117 million, or a loss of 93 cents a share, after net income of $26 million, or 18 cents a share, in the prior year's quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were looking for a loss of 66 cents a share. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Revenue fell 35% year-over-year to $688 million, but was above the FactSet estimate of $462 million. The company said that the revenue decline was driven by a 47% revenue decline at Harley-Davidson Motor Company, although this was partially offset by 4% revenue growth at Harley-Davidson Financial Services. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Related: Harley-Davidson's stock falls as motorbike maker lowers guidance to reflect still-pressured consumer </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     At Harley-Davidson Motor Company, global motorcycle shipments fell 53% to 14,010 during the quarter, which the company said was due to \"dealer channel de-stocking\" and market conditions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     \"In 2024, we saw our performance being significantly impacted by the continued cyclical headwinds for discretionary products, including the high-interest rate environment affecting consumer confidence,\" said Harley-Davidson (HOG) CEO Jochen Zeitz, in a statement. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     For 2025, the company expects earnings to be flat to down 5%. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were looking for earnings to rise 6.3%. The company expects Harley-Davidson Motor Company revenue to be flat to down 5% and operating income margin of 7.0% to 8.0%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Related: Harley-Davidson dealers say the company is sending them too many motorcycles </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     CFRA raised its rating for Harley-Davidson to sell Wednesday. \"While this was an ugly release, we raise our rating one notch to Sell, as we believe Street expectations will now be reset to more realistic levels and note that HOG still generates material free cash flow,\" wrote CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson, in a note. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Harley Davidson generated $1.07 billion net cash from operating activities in 2024, up from $754.9 million in the prior year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Harley-Davidson shares are down 22.4% in the last 12 months, compared with the S&amp;P 500 index's SPX gain of 21.9%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -James Rogers </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Stocks have also been up in 33 of 40 of those years - 83% of the time. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Positives for stocks? Lerner said they expect the U.S. economy to stay resilient in 2025, given how it weathered the pandemic, high inflation and the fastest Fed rate-hiking cycle in decades. He also notes a more balanced performance across the stock market so far with 10 of 11 large-cap sectors up this year. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     He expects earnings will deliver - this current earnings season has been \"solid,\" with 79% of S&amp;P 500 companies reporting beating consensus earnings estimates-and exceeding those estimates by an average of 6%, he says. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     As for where investors should be keeping their money, Lerner says he's holding on to a \"longstanding U.S. equity bias relative to international markets,\" owing to stronger economic and earnings trends. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Lerner prefers large-cap stocks over small-caps, due to strong balance sheets and \"more levers to pull to manage through challenging periods.\" And he also likes midcaps over small-caps, owing to stronger financial footing and better earnings trends. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     And he's focused on higher quality when it comes to fixed income, with \"tension between the potential of higher inflation offset by a flight to quality in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield.\" A modest position in gold is also something he favors right now, and for some investors, allocating to alternative strategies such as hedge funds can help smooth out the bumps he expects. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The markets </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Nasdaq-100 futures (NQ00) are leading declines for U.S. stock futures (ES00) (YM00), with Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y BX:TMUBMUSD02Y down and the dollar DXY off another 0.5%. </p>\n<pre class=\"mdc-article-pre\" data-v-776baeb1=\"\">   Key asset performance                                                Last       5d      1m      YTD    1y \n   S&amp;P 500                                                              6037.88    -0.49%  2.18%   2.66%  21.87% \n   Nasdaq Composite                                                     19,654.02  -0.40%  0.84%   1.78%  25.91% \n   10-year Treasury                                                     4.49       -2.90   -19.80  -8.60  33.32 \n   Gold                                                                 2892.8     4.34%   7.94%   9.60%  41.05% \n   Oil                                                                  72.36      -0.89%  -1.31%  0.68%  -2.32% \n   Data: MarketWatch.
