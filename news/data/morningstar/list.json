IT teams are tasked with deploying security tools that are designed to provide a specific type of protection across the network, endpoints, email, and cloud environments. This siloed approach requires dozens of systems to manage, which leads to operational challenges, fragmented policies, and security gaps for IT teams. At the same time, cyber-attacks <a class=\"mdc-link mds-link mdc-link--body\" data-v-4234e9e2=\"\" href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=N5tnHRrGZQCWzQkgJy3q1AH20HOnCTeeNtRSZ8vzcXBKgcgf_XCZfls2USDqEGOeb15gqahs79-mxZTBVKxnkbI3sGzlmduRLtW6giTK2z8=\" tabindex=\"0\">increased 44%</a> year-over-year, placing extreme pressure on security teams.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">The siloed nature of hybrid environments demands that security teams review and reconcile policies and processes across dozens of systems and tools.

China's Commerce Ministry also said that it would tighten control of exports of some critical minerals but didn't single out exports to any particular country. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  The earlier market cheer soured, with the offshore yuan weakening against the dollar, while benchmark indexes in Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea pared gains. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Oil futures extended losses, with front-month WTI crude oil futures down 1.8% to $71.83 per barrel, and Brent down 1.2% to $75.07 per barrel. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Bitcoin tumbled, falling below the key $100,000 handle. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n  Japan's Nikkei Stock Average closed 0.7% higher on Tuesday, after rising as much as 1.7% earlier in the session.
