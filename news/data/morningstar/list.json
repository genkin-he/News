Ning</a>, Co-CEO and Co-Founder of Nabis. “We see this expansion in our services not only as a collective investment in the digital and operational infrastructure of the future of cannabis retail and its community, but also as a shared vision of elevating the industry’s standards and business practices across the board.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nSince its launch in California in 2017, Nabis has been at the forefront of solving complex wholesale distribution challenges—the addition of retail partnerships now takes its commitment to innovation one step further and bolsters the company’s 2024 expansion into New York and Nevada.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nThe first retail-facing partnership Nabis is launching is with Dutchie, on a tech-integration collaboration, aimed to empower retailers with technology that aids their purchasing, inventory management and data-driven decision-making. By incorporating Dutchie’s Point of Sale (POS) system with Nabis’ wholesale <a class=\"mdc-link mds-link mdc-link--body\" data-v-4234e9e2=\"\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nabis.com%2Fservices%2Fmarketplace&amp;esheet=54198803&amp;newsitemid=20250204693059&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Marketplace+platform&amp;index=5&amp;md5=b093a122fda9aa73c7ce63fa6fd8f655\" tabindex=\"0\">Marketplace platform</a>, the partnership enables retailers across the market with an industry first: integrated tech tools that inform product management based on real-time inventory insights and demand forecasts. With features like automated order suggestions, custom pricing insights and market analysis tools, the result is a smarter, smoother supply chain for retailers.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n“The cannabis retail landscape is constantly evolving, and the ability to adapt quickly to market demands is crucial for retailers,” said Tim Barash, CEO of Dutchie. “This partnership is all about giving retailers the data and tools they need to remain competitive and efficient in an otherwise unpredictable industry.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nSeparate from their collaboration with Dutchie, Nabis is also partnering with one of California’s fastest growing retailers, on a new, centralized distribution solution. Previously, vendors who work with merchants like Embarc, which has multiple locations in one market, were forced to deliver products separately to each location. This collaboration with Nabis will give Embarc—and future retailers who use the Nabis Centralized Distribution Hub—access to one centralized storage facility for all inventory to be housed for delivery. Nabis’ 150,000-square-foot warehouse and fleet of over 100 vehicles will then ensure timely deliveries of product to each retail location, all while reducing transportation complexity and cutting costs.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n“We need a solution that allows our brand partners to scale with us in a way that does not overburden their distribution infrastructure,” said Jason Pitts, President of Supply Chain for Embarc. “Nabis’ centralized distribution solution creates operational efficiency for us and our brands while allowing our in-store teams to focus on maximizing the customer experience.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nNabis’ services will also help retailers aggregate their purchasing partners, enabling customized automation for buying, further ensuring retailers can maintain product variety while still meeting market demand. As cannabis markets nationwide continue to battle constant fluctuations, operators that are able to provide these types of comprehensive, scalable solutions for businesses at every stage of the supply chain will be increasingly vital. From producers to retailers, these partnerships effectively align the market’s supply chain for the first time, and lay the groundwork for more operational efficiency industry-wide.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nTo learn more about Nabis and its service offerings, please visit <a class=\"mdc-link mds-link mdc-link--body\" data-v-4234e9e2=\"\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nabis.com%2F&amp;esheet=54198803&amp;newsitemid=20250204693059&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=nabis.com&amp;index=6&amp;md5=8509ff762a9cd7053702f9c669270fc4\" tabindex=\"0\">nabis.com</a>.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">About Nabis</strong>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nNabis is the #1 licensed cannabis wholesale platform, servicing over 400 brands.

Adjusted for one-time items, it had EPS of $1.72, ahead of the $1.01 FactSet consensus. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Sales rose 7% to $15.624 billion, also ahead of the $15.483 billion FactSet consensus. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The numbers included a charge of 23 cents a share related to the execution of licensing agreements with LaNova Medicines Ltd. and Hansoh Pharma. The company also booked a $1.69 a share charge related to a cooperation agreement with Daiichi Sankyo. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Sales were boosted by a 19% rise for the company's blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda to $7.8 billion, ahead of the $7.6 billion FactSet consensus, as well as new product launches and strength in the animal health business. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Those were partially offset by lower sales of diabetic medicines Januvia and Janumet, and lower combined sales of the human papillomavirus, or HPV, vaccine Gardasil/Gardasil 9, due to reduced demand in China. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Gardasil sales fell 17% to $1.550 billion, while FactSet was expecting $1.564 billion. Januvia and Janumet sales fell 38% to $487 million, mostly due to lower pricing in the U.S. and generic competition in international markets. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Animal health sales rose 9% to $1.397 billion, driven by higher pricing for livestock and companion animal products. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Among the highlights in the quarter was a trial of Keytruda administered under the skin and combined with chemotherapy, which proved to be as effective when given intravenously. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Merck said it would discuss the results with regulators worldwide. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The news may help Merck retain sales of Keytruda, which is the world's best-selling drug, chalking up about $29 billion worth of sales in 2024, but one facing patent expiry in 2028. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Keytruda is an immunotherapy and works by stimulating the immune system to attack tumors. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The company is now expecting 2025 adjusted EPS of $8.88 to $9.03 on sales of $64.1 billion to $65.6 billion. The FactSet consensus is for EPS of $9.13 and sales of $67.0 billion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The stock has fallen 21% in the last 12 months, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX has gained 20.9%. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Ciara Linnane </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Derivatives Risk.</strong> Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Options Contracts.</strong> The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Distribution Risk.</strong> As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. </p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">High Portfolio Turnover Risk. </strong>The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Liquidity Risk. </strong>Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Non-Diversification Risk. </strong>Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">New Fund Risk</strong>. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Price Participation Risk.</strong> The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period.</p> <p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Inflation Risk. </strong>Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money.
