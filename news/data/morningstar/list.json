And Trump has said it could be as much as $2 trillion. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This isn't a tax cut, it's a tax hike. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     And what is this fund for? Trump said it would be \"to invest in great national endeavors for the benefit of all of the American people.\" This sounds like the famous scam during the South Sea Bubble 300 years ago, when a huckster gulled investors to buy stock in \"a company for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Good luck with that. \"Were not the fact stated by scores of credible witnesses,\" historian Charles Mackay later wrote, \"it would be impossible to believe that any person could have been duped by such a project.\" But duped they were. It showed, Mackay added, \"the utter madness of the people.\" </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     It is no coincidence that most of the leading sovereign-wealth funds around the world are run by corrupt oligarchies, mostly in the Middle East and Asia, riddled with cronyism of the worst kind. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, Norway runs its own sovereign-wealth fund pretty much as an index fund to minimize the risks of cronyism and corruption. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The idea of creating an American fund raises a long list of unanswerable questions. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Why, for example, would anyone think money would be invested more successfully by people in Washington than it would by private investors or fund managers? Why would they think such a fund would add any value? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Consider: Fund analyst company Morningstar lists about 350 U.S. mutual funds of significant size that have been around for at least 20 years. Of those, just eight seem to have outperformed a simple S&amp;P 500 SPX index fund over that period. That would be about 2%, give or take. (This doesn't even count the many funds that did so badly they closed, and dropped out of the screening.) </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     So what are the odds that political appointees in Washington will do so? </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This is the point where I have to remind you that this is supposed to be a Republican administration. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Trump suggested Monday that this fund could use taxpayers' money to buy TikTok. No, I'm not kidding. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Meanwhile, there's another problem. Many of the countries that have created sovereign-wealth funds, most notably oil-rich Norway, have done so in order to handle their government surpluses. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     America doesn't have government surpluses. It has deficits. Massive, massive deficits, stretching as far into the distance as the Congressional Budget Office's eye can see. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     The CBO reckons that U.S. national debt, already $29 trillion, is going to skyrocket to $52 trillion in just 10 years' time. That would be 118% of gross domestic product, an all-time high. Oh, and that's not even counting the effect of extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts, which would add an estimated $4.6 trillion to the debt. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     And this doesn't even include the tens of trillions of dollars that taxpayers are going to have to find to support Social Security and Medicare. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     If somehow the government is able to get hold of $2 trillion, they should be putting it toward the debt. Watching a bankrupt Uncle Sam get suckered into gambling his last nickels on a venture sold to him by a guy in a shiny tie from New York City sounds like something straight out of Mark Twain or O. Henry. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     Hard pass. </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     -Brett Arends </p>\n<p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Corporate landlords and their front group, the California Apartment Association, will do anything to keep charging outrageous rents and grow outsized profits – no matter the consequences to the poor and middle and working class.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nIn 2024, AHF and Housing Is A Human Right sponsored Proposition 33, which aimed to repeal statewide rent control restrictions and urgently address California’s housing affordability and homelessness crises. Prop 33 would have allowed cities to pass updated rent control policies and finally rein in predatory landlords – widespread rent gouging after the L.A. wildfires, for example, would have been largely prevented with new rent regulations.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nBut corporate landlords and the California Apartment Association raised $135.8 million to not only kill Prop 33, but to also pass Prop 34. The latter initiative sought to stop AHF from using certain money for its housing advocacy work. In November 2024, Big Real Estate successfully defeated Prop 33 and barely passed Prop 34.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n<em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">(Read: </em><a class=\"mdc-link mds-link mdc-link--body\" data-v-4234e9e2=\"\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40patrickrangemcdonald%2Fspecial-report-california-apartment-associations-big-money-schemes-to-kill-prop-33-and-pass-prop-d5df10bf9745&amp;esheet=54199869&amp;newsitemid=20250204942269&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=%26%238220%3BSpecial+Report%3A+California+Apartment+Association%26%238217%3Bs+Big-Money+Schemes+to+Kill+Prop+33+and+Pass+Prop+34.%26%238221%3B&amp;index=3&amp;md5=406c1c7985a1482ce270618ead569f3c\" tabindex=\"0\"><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">“Special Report: California Apartment Association’s Big-Money Schemes to Kill Prop 33 and Pass Prop 34.”</em></a><em class=\"mdc-article-emphasis\" data-v-370fea16=\"\">)</em>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nBoth the CAA’s No on Prop 33 and Yes on Prop 34 campaigns were funded by the California Apartment Association Issues Committee, and that’s where the shady contributions were delivered.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nBetween 2023 and 2024, Housing Is A Human Right found that 13 separate contributions were made to the California Apartment Association Issues Committee by corporate entities that were controlled by the same company, Rafanelli &amp; Nahas, a corporate landlord based in Lafayette, California. Those contributions added up to a significant total: $177,150.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nBy delivering campaign cash that way, Rafanelli &amp; Nahas were essentially trying to pull a fast one over the public – rather than have Rafanelli &amp; Nahas’ name attached to the 13 contributions, the names of its corporate entities were linked. For example, Amador Lakes III, LP, operated by Rafanelli &amp; Nahas, sent three contributions totaling $50,250 to the California Apartment Association Issues Committee. State law says the corporate landlord can’t do that – the public should know exactly who’s delivering campaign cash and how much is coming from that single contributor.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nIn addition, Housing Is A Human Right and AHF made the case that the California Apartment Association should have been aware that Rafanelli &amp; Nahas was trying to pull a fast one and not allowed the corporate landlord to file its campaign contributions in such an underhanded way.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\nOn February 4, the California Fair Political Practices Commission informed AHF and Housing Is A Human Right that it will be investigating the matter further.\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n“AHF and Housing Is A Human Right have always been about holding the California Apartment Association and corporate landlords accountable,” says Susie Shannon. “We’re very pleased that the FPPC has decided to look into this serious abuse of voter trust.”\n\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><span class=\"mdc-article-image\" data-v-91967a64=\"\"><picture class=\"mdc-responsive-image mdc-article-image__img\" data-v-91967a64=\"\"><source sizes=\"(max-width: 768w)\" srcset=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250204942269r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 1x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250204942269r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 2x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250204942269r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 3x\"><source sizes=\"(max-width: 1092w)\" srcset=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250204942269r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 1x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250204942269r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 2x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250204942269r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 3x\"><source sizes=\"(max-width: 600w)\" srcset=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250204942269r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 1x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250204942269r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 2x,https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250204942269r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en 3x\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"mdc-responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20250204942269r1&amp;sid=mstr3&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en\"/></source></source></source></picture></span><span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"></span></p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">\n<strong class=\"mdc-article-strong\" data-v-43363f62=\"\">Press Contact: \n</strong><br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/>Ged Kenslea, AHF Senior Director of Communications\n<br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/>323.791.5526\n<br data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"/><a class=\"mdc-link mds-link mdc-link--body\" data-v-4234e9e2=\"\" href=\"mailto:ged.kenslea@ahf.org\" tabindex=\"0\">ged.kenslea@ahf.org</a>\n</p><p class=\"mdc-article-paragraph\" data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\">View source version on businesswire.com: </span><span data-v-02ca9be7=\"\"><a class=\"mdc-link mds-link mdc-link--body\" data-v-4234e9e2=\"\" href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250204942269/en/\" tabindex=\"0\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250204942269/en/</a></span></p></div>",
