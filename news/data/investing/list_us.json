            "title": "Analysis-Trade war with China casts dark cloud over new US LNG projects",
            "description": "<div> By Curtis Williams HOUSTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's emerging trade war with Beijing poses a new threat to billions of dollars in planned U.S. liquefied natural gas export projects, many of which rely on China as a key buyer, according to analysts, industry sources, and company filings. The threat reflects the double-edged nature of Trump's protectionist policies, which are intended to boost U.S. business and force action to stop drug trafficking and illegal immigration, but could also inadvertently undermine his hopes of vastly expanding U.S. energy output. \"The tariffs may impact long-term contracting and offtake agreements...and make it more difficult for new US LNG projects to progress toward Final Investment Decisions,\" analysts at energy consulting firm EBW Analytics told customers in a note on Tuesday, referring to Beijing's decision to impose retaliatory levies on U.S. energy imports. Trump over the weekend announced a 10% tariff on Chinese imports as part of a broad plan to improve the U.S. trade balance, triggering retaliation from Beijing which slapped a 15% tariff on U.S. LNG and coal, and a 10% tariff on U.S. oil. The U.S. is the world's largest exporter of LNG and China has been a major buyer of the super-chilled gas, importing nearly 6%, or about 4.3 million metric tonnes, of total U.S. LNG exports last year, according to LSEG data. Chinese state-owned companies have signed LNG supply deals for over 20 million metric tonnes per annum (MTPA) from both existing and future U.S. export terminals, according to Reuters calculations. The two largest U.S. LNG exporters, Venture Global LNG and Cheniere, have 14 million MTPA in agreed long-term contracts with Chinese companies, according to their public announcements. Venture Global declined to respond to requests for comment, while Cheniere and rival  Energy Transfer  (NYSE:ET), which has a long-term sales and purchase agreement with China, were not immediately available for comment. Freeport LNG, the third-largest U.S. LNG exporter, also declined to comment. There are eight LNG export terminals operating in the U.S., three under construction and almost 20 more at various stages of development. Companies are pushing ahead with projects for new or expanded LNG export capacity after the Trump administration in January lifted a moratorium on new LNG export permits, imposed by former President Joe Biden over concerns about the projects' environmental and economic impacts.  But Charlie Riedl, the Executive Director of the Center for LNG, a trade group representing many U.S. LNG exporters and developers, said China’s decision to impose tariffs injects uncertainty into the industry and weakens America’s competitive position in global energy markets. \"These tariffs on U.S. LNG directly undermine the Trump administration’s efforts to expand American energy exports and strengthen our geopolitical influence,\" Riedl said. A White House official told Reuters that Chinese tariffs on U.S. LNG could have limited economic impact, but said the risk is worthwhile. \"There is not a dollar value you can put on saving American lives from fentanyl deaths,\" the official said, reflecting U.S. concerns that China is a major source of the drug and chemicals used to make it. Trump wants to expand the export markets for LNG to other nations as well, creating less risk from any Chinese actions, the official said.  BIG CONTRACTS  LNG developers use long-term contracts or sales and purchase agreements to help secure funding for their projects from banks. They are a key element in moving projects from the development stage to a final investment decision. Venture Global, the most valuable U.S. LNG exporter with two plants operating in Louisiana and three more under development, has signed 9.5 MTPA in supply deals with Chinese companies so far, according to company filings.  Cheniere Energy (NYSE:LNG), the second-most valuable U.S. LNG company and currently the largest exporter, has more than 4.5 MTPA in long-term Chinese deals, according to its announcements. As part of the prospectus for its blockbuster initial public offering in January, Venture Global warned investors of its exposure to a possible trade war between the world's two largest economies. \"These factors could adversely affect our ability to market the remaining production capacity of our projects, which could have a material adverse effect on the viability of our projects and on our business,\" Venture Global told investors at the time. Its stock was down almost 5% in afternoon trading on Tuesday, while Cheniere was down less than 1%.   </div>",

            "title": "Wall Street ends higher on US-China trade optimism, energy boost",
            "description": "<div> By Abigail Summerville and Sukriti Gupta (Reuters) - The three major stock indexes closed higher on Tuesday, aided by energy stocks, while investors saw reason for optimism for a trade breakthrough between the U.S. and China after President Donald Trump delayed tariffs for Canada and Mexico.  New 10% U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports took effect on Tuesday, which China countered with levies on U.S. goods. It was unclear when the country's leaders would talk and Trump said he was in no hurry. Energy stocks led the S&P gains, while utilities and consumer staples lost ground.  Trump had said over the weekend he would impose a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada, but agreed to a 30-day pause on Monday in return for border and crime concessions from both countries. \"The president was so quick to offer a 30-day stay of execution to Mexico and Canada, so you get the idea that maybe what he's really trying to do is embrace a quick declaration of victory which doesn’t change much from a trade perspective,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. \"Investors have been breathing a sigh of relief today and we’ll see if a month from now they can continue to breathe that sigh of relief.\"  Strong corporate earnings have also buoyed investor optimism. Of the 211 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings for the fourth quarter, 76.8% reported above analyst expectations, according to an S&P earnings scorecard. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) rose ahead of its quarterly results, which are due after markets close, while Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) also advanced. Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) shares jumped after the data analytics company forecast first-quarter and annual revenue above Wall Street estimates. According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 gained 42.51 points, or 0.71%, to end at 6,037.08 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 259.19 points, or 1.34%, to 19,651.14. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 132.56 points, or 0.30%, to 44,554.47. Biotechnology firm Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) dropped, while PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH), the holding company for brands including Calvin Klein, slipped after China placed the companies on its \"unreliable entity list\".  Trump's delayed tariffs for Canada and Mexico helped the three major U.S. stock indexes pare some of the heavy losses suffered earlier on Monday and close trading well off session lows. Three Federal Reserve officials warned on Monday that trade tariffs carried inflation risks, with one arguing that uncertainty over the outlook for prices called for slower interest-rate cuts than otherwise. A Labor Department report showed U.S. job openings stood at 7.6 million in December, compared to an estimated 8 million, according to economists polled by Reuters. In earnings-driven moves, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) fell after it forecast annual profit below expectations and missed quarterly revenue estimates.   Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) plummeted after the cosmetics company posted another weak quarter amid demand weakness and announced job cuts.   Merck  (NSE:PROR) dropped after the drugmaker said it would pause shipments of Gardasil to China through at least mid-year, as continued weak demand for the HPV vaccine there is expected to hurt the company's 2025 revenues. PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) fell after the digital payments giant's operating margin shrank in the fourth quarter.  </div>",

            "description": "<div> (Reuters) -Electronic Arts forecast fourth-quarter bookings below Wall Street expectations on Tuesday, as the videogame publisher grapples with a slowdown in spending at its popular soccer franchise.  It also announced a $1 billion share repurchase plan, which sent its shares up around 1% in extended trading.  EA expects fourth-quarter bookings between $1.44 billion and $1.59 billion, compared with estimates of $1.65 billion, as per data compiled by LSEG.  The downbeat projection comes a few weeks after the company slashed its annual bookings forecast citing weak in-game spending for \"FC 25\" and underperformance of its new Dragon Age title amid an uncertain economic environment marked by high inflation.  The unexpected move sparked fears about the trajectory of one of the company's most coveted titles, even as it experiences success with other sports games. However, CEO Andrew Wilson said the company is \"confident in a return to growth in FY26 and beyond,\" with multiple games under development including the next installment of \"Battlefield.\"  EA's sports portfolio has remained one of its strongest assets, especially its American football titles, which topped sales charts last year and are on track to exceed $1 billion in net bookings for this fiscal year, the company said. EA is largely dependent on in-game spending for its major sports titles, constantly updating them with new content to keep players engaged.  The company reported third-quarter bookings of $2.22 billion, missing expectations of $2.32 billion. It left its annual bookings forecast unchanged.  Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $1.11, compared with $1.07 in the previous year.  </div>",

            "description": "<div> By Deena Beasley (Reuters) - Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) posted a higher quarterly profit on Tuesday, driven by an 11% rise in product sales, and said late-stage studies of key obesity drug candidate MariTide will start before mid-year but regulators have placed a hold on an early-stage trial of a different experimental weight-loss drug. The California-based biotech company said adjusted fourth-quarter earnings rose 13% from a year earlier to $5.31 per share, beating the $5.08 estimated by analysts, according to LSEG data. Net earnings fell 18% to $1.16 per share, due mainly to losses on equity investments. Quarterly revenue rose 11% to $9.1 billion, which exceeded analyst estimates of $8.52 billion. For full-year 2025, Amgen said it expects adjusted earnings per share of $20.00 to $21.20 on revenue of $34.4 billion to $35.7 billion. Analysts have forecast EPS of $20.82 on revenue of $33 billion. The outlook is \"demonstrative of our confidence and conviction of being able to grow through the denosumab loss of exclusivity this year,\" Amgen CFO Peter Griffith said, referring to the expiration of patents on the company's drugs for bone diseases like osteoporosis. He expects biosimilar competition sometime in the middle of this year. Amgen investors have been focused on prospects for MariTide, which activates the appetite- and blood sugar-reducing hormone known as GLP-1 while blocking a second gut hormone called GIP. The drug, given by injection once monthly or less often, was shown in a mid-stage trial to help overweight or obese patients shed up to 20% of their body weight. Amgen on Tuesday said follow-up data from that study, and from a trial of the drug in people with diabetes, are expected in the second half of this year. The company said the first studies in a broad Phase 3 program for MariTide, which could provide data enabling regulatory approval of the medicine, are expected to begin in the first half of this year. It also said a Phase 1 study of a drug known as AMG 513 in people living with obesity was placed on clinical hold by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The regulatory agency issues holds to protect trial participants from unreasonable risk and to ensure that studies are conducted properly. Amgen, which has not disclosed a mechanism of action for AMG 513, said discussions are underway on a path forward to reopen the study. The company's fourth-quarter sales of cholesterol-lowering medication Repatha rose 45% to $606 million, while sales of bone drug Prolia rose 5% to $1.2 billion and sales of arthritis drug Enbrel were flat at $1 billion. In the rare disease space, Amgen's sales of thyroid eye disease drug Tepezza rose 3% to $460 million, and sales of gout treatment Krystexxa rose 27% to $346 million.  </div>",

            "description": "<div> (Reuters) - Toymaker Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) on Tuesday forecast full-year profit above Wall Street expectations after beating holiday quarter sales estimates, helped by stable demand for its action figures and Hot Wheels vehicles. The company expects 2025 adjusted profit per share in the range of $1.66 to $1.72, above analysts' average estimate of $1.58, according to data compiled by LSEG.  The forecast included the anticipated impact of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada announced on Saturday, which Mattel aims to mitigate through supply chain optimization and potential price increases on its toys.  Levies on Mexico and Canada were paused for a month while tariffs were being imposed on China, which retaliated with levies of its own. \"Our exposure in the U.S. to China sourcing is about 20%,\" Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz told Reuters.  Currently, less than 40% of Mattel's global product is manufactured in China, compared to an industry average of about 80%, analysts have noted. Toy manufacturers have worked to get ahead of the incoming tariffs and reduce their exposure to China by shifting production out of the region and reviewing product lines. Through 2024, the Barbie parent undertook stringent cost-control measures to protect its margins from sluggish demand through 2024. Those efforts included streamlining its supply chain and exiting underperforming products. On Tuesday, the company said it was tracking ahead of its target to achieve $200 million in cost savings by the end of 2026 and plans to repurchase $600 million of shares through 2025. Mattel expects a net sales growth of 2% to 3% for 2025, slightly below analysts' expectations of a 2.7% rise to $5.51 billion. Weak Barbie sales and a shorter holiday season in December kept sales in check, with worldwide gross billings for dolls were down 4% in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. Net sales rose 2% to $1.65 billion. Analysts on average had expected flat sales of $1.63 billion.  </div>",
