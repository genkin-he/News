            "description": "<div> (Reuters) - Shares of Calvin Klein-owner PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH) and genetic testing company Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) fell in U.S. premarket trading on Tuesday after China placed the two companies on its \"unreliable entity\" list, making them eligible for sanctions. Companies added to the blacklist can be subject to fines and a broad range of other sanctions, including a freeze on trade and revocation of work permits for foreign staff. PVH had already been under scrutiny from Chinese regulators over \"improper\" conduct related to the Xinjiang region.  For Illumina, China accounts for about 7% of sales. Two of its Chinese rivals, MGI and BGI, were listed in a U.S. bill that aims to restrict business with several biotech companies on grounds of national security. Shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) also fell 1% to $19.20 in premarket trading after the Financial Times reported that Chinese regulators were also looking to launch a formal probe into the chipmaker.  An influential Chinese industry group called for a security review late last year against Intel's products sold in China.  The announcement was part of a string of measures by China in response to new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. China also said it was investigating Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).  However, Alphabet's shares edged up nearly 1%, as some of its key products, including its Google search engine, are already blocked in China and its revenue from the country represents only about 1% of its global sales.  Illumina's shares were down 4.1% at $125.71, while PVH's stock fell 2.4% to $80.49 before the opening bell.  </div>",

            "description": "<div>Aave, a decentralized lending protocol, successfully navigated through a tumultuous day in the crypto markets that saw bitcoin's price tumble, yet emerged without accumulating any new bad debt, according to Chaos Labs data.The broader cryptocurrency market experienced significant volatility at the start of the week, with bitcoin's price dropping sharply to nearly $91,000 from $100,000 amid fears of a renewed trade war involving the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and China. However, the market recovered some of its losses later that day following President Donald Trump's decision to delay tariffs on Mexico by 30 days.During the volatile market conditions, Aave processed a record $210 million in liquidations, the highest since the market crash on August 5. Despite the high volume of liquidations, the protocol did not incur any new bad debt. Bad debt occurs when borrowers are unable to repay loans and the collateral they provided is not enough to cover the debt, a risk that is exacerbated during market instability.Chaos Labs reported that Aave's liquidations were carried out effectively, particularly on the Ethereum Main instance, highlighting the protocol's robust risk management and liquidation systems. These mechanisms allowed Aave to settle collateralized positions and minimize losses.The performance of Aave under stress was praised by a DeFi observer known as leo, who attributed the success to the decentralized finance sector's strong foundation, which includes strict collateral management and well-designed protocols for liquidation, supported by substantial liquidity pools.Looking ahead, upgrades to Aave's system, such as version 3.3, v4, and the Umbrella updates, are set to further enhance the DeFi industry. The Aave v3.3 update, announced in December, includes features to manage uncollateralized bad debt from liquidations more efficiently and to address the accumulation of minimal, hard-to-liquidate debt known as dust debt.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

            "description": "<div>Investing.com - Shares of Applied Optoelectronics (NASDAQ:AAOI) fell 7% after a report by Culper Research accused the company of grossly misrepresenting its prospects in the 800G transceiver market. The report, which involved interviews with former employees, competitors, hyperscalers, and industry experts, as well as site visits, suggests that Applied Optoelectronics has exaggerated its ability to scale 800G production and has likely lost potential customer opportunities.Culper Research's investigation indicates that despite claims of shipping 800G samples to customers in the third quarter of 2023, these samples were not ready until much later. A former employee from Meta (formerly Facebook (NASDAQ:META)) stated that Applied Optoelectronics promised 800G samples within three quarters, but by the time the samples were available, the request for quotation (RFQ) had already closed.The report further alleges that Applied Optoelectronics has not disclosed any 800G customer and has postponed its revenue expectations from this technology by three quarters. In addition, the company's claim of re-engaging with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and being ready to ramp up production was met with dissatisfaction from the e-commerce giant, according to sources who claim Amazon was angry after Applied Optoelectronics failed to deliver on its production promises.Culper Research also challenges Applied Optoelectronics' portrayal of its relationship with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), suggesting that revenue from Microsoft has been limited to lower-end products and cables, while Microsoft has been deploying 800G transceivers from other competitors.The report casts doubt on Applied Optoelectronics' manufacturing capabilities, citing failed attempts to sell its Chinese manufacturing assets and an empty expansion site in Taiwan. Experts consulted in the report believe that significant U.S. production is unlikely due to higher costs and labor rates, contrary to CEO Lin's claims of feasibility.Applied Optoelectronics has not yet responded to the allegations made in the Culper Research report. The stock's decline reflects investor concerns over the company's ability to compete and scale production in the critical 800G market, which is key to the future of data center and telecommunications infrastructure.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

            "description": "<div> By Ananya Mariam Rajesh (Reuters) -PepsiCo forecast annual profit below expectations and missed quarterly revenue estimates on Tuesday, as the Doritos maker battles weakening demand for its sodas and snacks such as Lay's in the United States, its largest market. Shares of PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) fell 2.5% in early trading. Americans are still paring back spending on soft drinks and salty treats to save their dollars for essential purchases, forcing PepsiCo to tap promotions for volume growth after several quarters of slowdown wrought by price hikes. The target is to offer multi-packs and mini canisters to bring back consumers leaning towards smaller pack sizes or cheaper alternatives from retail aisles. PepsiCo also promised heavy investments into overhauling its existing products and introducing new items such as ethnic-inspired flavor offerings through its Sabritas, Marias and Natu Chip brands to spur demand. \"We expect our North America performance to gradually improve as the year progresses, and our commercial activities take hold,\" executives said in the company's prepared remarks.  PepsiCo's North America beverages and Frito-Lay North America, its two biggest segments, reported a 3% volume decline in the fourth quarter.  The company's total organic volume slipped 1% for the quarter ended Dec. 28, while average prices jumped 3%.  \"Frito-Lay business is still finding its footing as elevated prices weigh on snacking trends ... beverage business also continues to lose share, and we believe PepsiCo is reaching its pain threshold,\" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi. PepsiCo expects a low-single-digit increase for fiscal 2025 core earnings per share, compared with analysts' estimates for a 4.73% rise to $8.53 per share, according to data compiled by LSEG. Its quarterly net revenue fell 0.2% to $27.78 billion, missing estimates of $27.89 billion. Excluding items, PepsiCo earned $1.96 per share, above expectations of $1.94.  \"They have undergone some pretty big investments in terms of increasing productivity and reducing costs, that certainly seems to play out in the growth of earnings ... but the top line revenue is definitely under pressure,\" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, which has a stake in PepsiCo.  </div>",

            "description": "<div>RBC Capital Markets shared insights in anticipation of Chipotle Mexican Grill’s (NYSE:CMG) fourth-quarter 2024 earnings, which are scheduled to be released on February 4, after market close. The firm’s analysts highlighted several key areas of focus for investors, including same-store sales (SSS) guidance, restaurant margin drivers, and updates on operational efficiencies and international expansion.Ahead of the print’s release, analysts maintain an Outperform rating on CMG stock, citing the company's ability to navigate various macroeconomic conditions, leverage its pricing power, and achieve year-over-year margin improvement throughout 2025. Despite facing challenges such as labor headwinds, commodity volatility, and increased investment in portion sizes in the second half of 2024, analysts expect Chipotle to show progress in margins. They project a conservative margin improvement, potentially reaching mid-30% incremental restaurant level margins (RLM), with the possibility of achieving historical levels of around 40%.Investors will also closely analyze the company's fiscal year 2025 SSS guidance during the earnings release. Current Wall Street models predict a 5.4% increase, but analysts suggest there may be some conservatism in these estimates due to the impact of January's weather on traffic. “While third-party (3P) data has been relatively soft to start the year, we think this is in some part driven by January weather,” analysts said in a note. “Further, we think underlying demand trends remain intact as consumer sentiment continued to improve through the end of 2024,” they added. Moreover, analysts expect updates on new equipment rollouts, such as the new produce slicer and testing of Hyphen Augmented Makeline and Autocado, which could enhance store operations and contribute to traffic growth. “Given finishing prep prior to lunch rush is critical to speed of service, we think investors will look for an update on how new equipment, particularly the new produce slicer, currently rolling out to all restaurants, will impact store operations and translate to traffic growth,” they continued. Updates on international growth opportunities are also anticipated, following management's previous comments about exploring additional international partnerships.In October, Chipotle reported third-quarter same-store sales growth that fell short of market expectations on Tuesday, as higher menu prices dampened demand. Rising costs for key ingredients like avocados and dairy also pressured margins.  Comparable sales increased 6% in the quarter, slightly below the 6.3% gain analysts had anticipated, according to LSEG data.</div>",

            "description": "<div>On Tuesday, ARK Investment Management LLC shared its Big Ideas 2025 report, outlining a future where the robotics industry is poised to transform various sectors and significantly boost productivity. The report highlights the potential for specialized robots, such as household appliances, to dramatically reduce the time required for everyday tasks.The report identifies a substantial global revenue opportunity, estimating that generalizable robotics could generate over $26 trillion, with approximately $13 trillion each in household and manufacturing robotics. ARK emphasizes the versatility of humanoid robots, which are expected to become increasingly common worldwide due to their adaptability in environments designed for humans.As costs decrease and productivity gains from humanoid robots rise, ARK anticipates a surge in adoption. They equate a 100% productivity increase from these robots to the work of a human over ten years. In the context of a restaurant, while a dishwashing machine represents only one of many tasks, the automation of household chores like dishwashing and cleaning could represent a $250 billion revenue opportunity in the U.S. alone.Small businesses, according to ARK, stand to gain disproportionately from humanoid robots. Larger firms have benefited from specialized automation, allowing them to scale and pay higher wages. However, small firms have numerous tasks that could be automated but currently are not, making them ideal candidates for generalizable automation solutions such as humanoid robots.The report also touches on the broader economic impact of automation, suggesting that turning non-market activities into revenue-generating ones could significantly contribute to GDP. It cites that if U.S. consumers valued their unpaid labor, such as food preparation and cleanup, at half their hourly wages, it could add approximately $1 trillion to GDP annually.Finally, ARK addresses the 3D printing industry, forecasting a potential annual growth rate of around 40% to $180 billion by 2030. The industry saw notable consolidation in 2024, with acquisitions such as Nano Dimension (NASDAQ:NNDM)'s purchase of Desktop Metal and Markforged. The report suggests that further consolidation could occur if more manufacturers internalize 3D printing technology, similar to  General Electric  (NYSE:GE)'s strategy. It also notes that industries poised for rapid scaling, like drone manufacturing and nuclear power, could leverage 3D printing to expedite their market entry.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.
