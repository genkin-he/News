            "description": "<div> TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's largest lender Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group reported on Wednesday a 32% surge in quarterly net profit, powered by sales of cross-shareholdings and a bump in margins due to higher interest rates in Japan. Three rate hikes since March 2024 have widened domestic loan spreads, while the return of inflation has encouraged large Japanese corporations, which make up the bulk of MUFG's corporate clients, to take on loans for growth investments. Profit in the October-December period came in at 490.74 billion yen ($3.16 billion) versus 370.64 billion yen a year earlier, according to Reuters' calculations based on nine-month cumulative figures disclosed in a filing. MUFG has reached 99.9% of its annual profit guidance of 1.75 trillion yen in the first nine months of the financial year, and is narrowly trailing the 1.841 trillion yen average annual estimate of 14 analysts polled by LSEG. The lender, which owns about 23.5% of Wall Street bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), sold an additional 55 billion worth of its equity holdings over the October-December period, with a further 37 billion agreed to be sold before the end of March 2027.

            "description": "<div> By Sam Nussey TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's Nintendo cut its full-year sales  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH) forecast by 12% to 11 million units as the aging console loses momentum ahead of the launch of a successor device this year. Nintendo remains dependent on its console business even as it has opened stores and its roster of characters feature in theme parks and film.  \"While we think sales of hardware and software are solid for the eighth year, we did not achieve our plan,\" Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa told an earnings briefing.  Nintendo sold 9.54 million Switch units in the April-December period, bringing lifetime sales to 150.86 million units.  Last month Nintendo said it will release a successor to the hit home-portable Switch console this year with a Nintendo Direct event to air on April 2.  The Switch 2 appears to closely follow the design of its predecessor, which transformed Nintendo's fortunes after the underperformance of the Wii U.  The company lowered its operating profit forecast by 22.2% to 280 billion yen ($1.8 billion) for the financial year ending March.  In the April-December period, profit fell 46.7% to 247.6 billion yen.  ($1 = 155.2900 yen) </div>",

            "title": "UBS trounces profit forecasts, $3 billion share buyback conditional on capital rules",
            "description": "<div> By Ariane Luthi ZURICH (Reuters) -UBS Group posted fourth-quarter profit that beat forecasts by a wide margin and said it would buy back up to $3 billion in shares this year if there were no major changes to bank capital rules in Switzerland in the near term. The country's largest lender, which has made progress in integrating former rival Credit Suisse, said it plans to repurchase $1 billion of shares in the first half of 2025 and up to $2 billion in the second half. To prevent a repeat of scandal-hit Credit Suisse's meltdown, Swiss authorities have pledged to draw up stricter banking regulations, at the centre of which are plans to make UBS hold more capital. But it is not yet clear how much that will be. UBS says existing capital requirements are appropriate and has warned the Swiss government that excessive demands could make the country's financial sector less competitive. The fourth quarter saw UBS post net profit attributable to shareholders of $770 million, marking its fourth consecutive quarter of profit. That was far more than an average estimate of $483 million in a company-provided poll, with UBS benefitting from lower-than-expected costs, robust revenues and a strong performance by its investment bank. \"We achieved all key integration milestones in 2024 and significantly reduced execution risk, while our capital position remained robust,\" UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti said in a statement. \"We are confident in our ability to substantially complete the integration by the end of 2026, achieve our financial targets, and fulfill our growth initiatives as we position UBS for a successful future,\" he added. UBS said it was on track to achieve planned cost savings, though it raised its forecast for integration-related expenses to $14 billion by the end of 2026, up from $13 billion.  Total  (EPA:TTEF) revenues climbed 7% to $11.6 billion year-on-year, narrowly beating the company-provided consensus forecast of $11.5 billion. The bank also said it would maintain its target common equity tier 1 capital (CET1) ratio of around 14%.  Analysts at Bank Vontobel lauded UBS for \"good cost management\" though Citi analysts noted overall cost saving and cost-income guidance through end-2026 remained unchanged and gave a neutral rating. \"On balance a decent set of results, but perhaps not as good as at first glance,\" the Citi analysts wrote. Net new assets attracted in global wealth management during the quarter amounted to $18 billion, missing a forecast of $21 billion from Zuercher Kantonalbank analysts. Investors have warmed to the 2023 Credit Suisse takeover, with UBS's shares rising by more than 80% since then. UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti said last week the migrating of Credit Suisse clients to its IT system was going well, but that it would remain a major focal point for the next 12 months. </div>",

            "description": "<div> By Katya Golubkova, Trixie Yap (Reuters) -U.S. crude prices fell by nearly 2% on Tuesday as U.S. tariffs on China took effect, though President Donald Trump paused for a month a decision on steep levies on neighbours Canada and Mexico. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude declined $1.32, or 1.8%, to trade at $71.84 per barrel, while Brent futures fell 87 cents, or 1.2%, to $75.09 by 0617 GMT. U.S. tariffs of 10% on Chinese imports took effect at mid-day in Asian trade, spurring Beijing to retaliate with levies of 15% on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas and 10% on crude oil starting from Feb. 10. \"China’s counter-tariffs on the US may be perceived as a sign of escalation and may reduce the likelihood of a temporary resolution akin to U.S. agreements with Mexico and Canada,\" IG market strategist Yeap Jun Rong said in an email.  \"As such, broader risk sentiments pare some optimism amid the changing dynamics, with oil prices extending losses further.\" He added, \"Market participants are back to price for potential downside risks to global growth in the event of further tit-for-tat measures from both the United States and China.\"  China's 2024 crude oil imports from the United States make up 1.7% of its total imports of crude, customs data show.  \"WTI flows to China will be impacted, as a 10% tariff ... will render WTI delivered to China very expensive against other alternative crude like Kazakhstan's CPC and Abu Dhabi's Murban,\" Sparta Commodities' senior analyst June Goh told Reuters. \"However, in the big scheme of things, this should not impact the price of WTI significantly as WTI can still flow to other regions easily,\" she added on messaging app WhatsApp.   Earlier, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said they had agreed to bolster border enforcement efforts in response to Trump's demand to crack down on immigration and drug smuggling.  That would pause for 30 days tariffs of 25%, with a 10% tariff on energy imports from Canada, that had been set to take effect on Tuesday.  On the demand side, investors will be looking out for weekly U.S. oil stockpile data for the week to Jan. 31. [EIA/S] Analysts polled by Reuters expected that crude inventories rose, while gasoline and distillate inventories probably fell. </div>",

            "description": "<div> (Reuters) -Diageo withdrew its medium-term organic sales growth target on Tuesday as the world's top spirits maker took steps to try and mitigate the impact of U.S. tariffs.  The maker of Johnnie Walker whisky and Guinness beer had previously forecast medium-term organic net sales growth of 5% to 7%. It said it had scrapped the forecast because macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty were hurting the pace of its recovery. CEO Debra Crew said tariffs in the U.S. announced over the weekend added to \"further complexity in our ability to provide updated forward guidance\". Over the weekend U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, although on Monday he agreed a 30-day pause on the tariffs on Canada and Mexico. China hit back on Tuesday with tariffs of its own on some U.S. goods.   Diageo  (LON:DGE) said there were a number of possible actions it could take to help mitigate the impact of tariffs including pricing, inventory management, re-allocation of investments and supply chain optimisation.  \"We will ... continue to engage with the U.S. administration on the broader impact that this will have on ...consumers, employees, distributors, restaurants, bars and other retail outlets,\" Crew said in a statement.  The company said its tequila made in Mexico and exported into the United States would be the most hit by U.S. tariffs. It would also see a hit on its Canadian whisky that it exports to the U.S.  Diageo said its organic sales grew 1% in July-December 2024, beating a 0.4% increase expected by analysts in a company-compiled poll. Investors had expected new finance chief Nik Jhangiani, who took office in September, to row back the company's medium-term sales target given falling sales across the alcoholic beverages sector.  Consumers have remained cautious and the macroeconomic recovery is taking longer than expected, particularly in North America and China, Diageo said.  </div>",

            "description": "<div>Investing.com- Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Technologies is set to report its fourth-quarter earnings before the U.S. market opens on Tuesday, capping off a year of revenue stabilization and improving margins for the music streaming giant.The company is expected to post revenue of 4.14 billion euros for the three months to December 31, with earnings of 2.03 euros per share, according to Investing.com data. SPOT guided revenue of 4.1 billion euros.Analysts said that they were confident SPOT’s earnings will at least be in line with company guidance, while the company’s gross margin is expected at 31.8%. They expect monthly average users and premium subscribers at 665 million and 260 million, in line with SPOT’s forecasts. “We note that social charges and any FX headwinds in no way indicate any slowdown in the fundamentals of the business which we believe remain extremely strong,” analysts said. The firm reiterated its Buy rating on SPOT with a price objective of $515, representing a downside of 6% from SPOT’s Monday close. The investment bank noted that 2024 was a year of strong revenue growth and monetization for SPOT, with this momentum expected to spill over into the coming year. But while analysts do expect margin expansion to persist, it will likely grow at a slower pace than the prior year, amid continued investment in business expansion. The investment bank said SPOT is at an inflection point in profitability and free cash flow, amid improved penetration in current markets, future price increases, more pricing tiers, better advertising, and fresh business models. </div>",
