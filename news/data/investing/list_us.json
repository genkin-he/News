            "description": "<div> MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's finance ministry said on Tuesday it was implementing measures to guarantee the stability of financial markets, as the peso currency and local stock exchange have undergone extended volatility amid the threat of U.S. tariffs on Mexican exports. Among the measures, the so-called budget revenue stabilization fund was strengthened and capitalized with more than 100 billion pesos ($4.87 billion), while the government will continue to look for ways to improve the debt maturity profile and reduce short-term liquidity needs. On January 31, the government refinanced 185 billion pesos it debt, extending debt maturities by an average of 2.14 years, the finance ministry said in a statement. \"The third measure involves the implementation of a hedging program with derivative financial instruments, which contributes to reduce risk amid adverse conditions in the financial markets,\" said the ministry.

            "title": "Google-owner Alphabet is due to report after the bell. Here's what to look out for",
            "description": "<div>Investing.com - Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is due to report its latest quarterly returns after the closing bell on Tuesday, with much of the focus likely to revolve around its artificial intelligence strategy. Analysts are expected to pay especially close attention to the search giant's plans for spending on the technology in the wake of the emergence of an AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek last week.DeepSeek said its model rivalled OpenAI's ChatGPT in performance despite using less-advanced data and costing only roughly $6 million to develop. Although serious doubts have been cast over the claims, DeepSeek's notoriety has raised questions around recent heavy expenditures on AI by some of Silicon Valley's biggest players, including Alphabet.In the fallout from DeepSeek's rise, Alphabet's peers have faced sharp questioning from investors worried about the future AI leadership of U.S. mega-cap tech titans. Speaking in a post-earnings call last week, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) said that costs related to AI have been coming down, predicting that demand will grow \"exponentially\" as AI becomes \"more efficient and accessible\". Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg also presented an optimistic outlook for the Instagram-parent's AI plans, although a somewhat disappointing first-quarter revenue guidance threatened to exacerbate concerns over its bets on expensive AI-powered tools.Comments from Alphabet executives on Tuesday could further sway investor sentiment around Big Tech's AI ambitions. Estimates suggest that the company shelled out $50 billion in capital expenditures last year, according to LSEG data cited by Reuters. More spending has also been proposed for this year, as Alphabet looks to enhance its prowess in both AI and cloud computing. Analysts at Truist said in a note to clients that they believe Alphabet has a particular advantage in its bid to fold AI into its massive search operations, arguing that it is \"Google's war to lose\". In December, Google also released a new generation of its AI model Gemini and unveiled fresh ways to use AI beyond chatbots.\"We believe [Google] has a competitive advantage of training its [large language model], Gemini, on proprietary data across its apps and services, and the company expects Gemini to be significantly more thoughtful, accurate, and useful than competitor models through its enhanced learning and multi-modal capabilities,\" the analysts said.Meanwhile, analysts estimated that Alphabet's fourth-quarter revenue will be \"virtually in line\" with Wall Street consensus estimates in the low double-digits, thanks to \"solid user engagement\" across its search and YouTube video services - which are used by over 2 billion people each month. Still, the rate of overall revenue expansion is anticipated to have slowed compared to the prior quarter, weighed down by Google's cloud computing and advertising units.Quarterly operating income margin is also tipped to be above 30%, as measures to contain costs more than offset elevated capital investments, the analysts said.Shares in Alphabet have jumped by more than 39% over the past one-year period. The company is often included in the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" group of mega-cap tech giants that have driven a stock market rally in recent years.</div>",

            "title": "Trump administration sued over order banning transgender healthcare for minors",
            "description": "<div> By Brendan Pierson (Reuters) -Families of transgender children on Tuesday asked a federal court to block President Donald Trump's order to end all federal funding or support for healthcare that aids gender transitions for people younger than 19. In a lawsuit filed against the Trump administration in Maryland federal court, the families, who are represented by Lambda Legal and the American Civil Liberties Union, allege that the order discriminates against transgender people and goes beyond Trump's authority as president. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. As a result of the order, the lawsuit said, hospitals across the country have already begun canceling appointments for gender transition treatments.  The plaintiffs say their appointments were canceled in recent days by Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C., NYU Langone in New York, Boston Children's Hospital and Children’s Hospital of Richmond in Virginia. The hospitals are not defendants in the case. Trump, a Republican, said in the Jan. 28 order that it is \"the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures.\"  Details about how far the order will reach and how it will be enforced were not immediately clear. It directed the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to \"take all appropriate actions to end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\" That could include imposing conditions on healthcare providers receiving any federal funds, which virtually all hospitals do. The lawsuit called the order \"part of a broad and sweeping attack President Trump has launched against 'gender ideology' and transgender people.\" It followed a previous executive order by Trump banning transgender people from the military, and another stating that the government will not recognize gender identity apart from \"an individual's immutable biological classification as either male or female.\" The order on the military has already been challenged by transgender rights groups. The other has been challenged in two separate lawsuits by transgender women incarcerated in federal prisons who face transfer to men's prisons, one of whom has won a temporary restraining order blocking her transfer. Treatments covered by the order include puberty blockers, hormones and surgery provided to patients under 19 for the purpose of gender transition. Such treatments are often known as gender-affirming care. Republicans in more than half of the 50 states have passed laws or policies that ban gender-affirming care for minors, some of which have been blocked or overturned by the courts. A challenge to Tennessee's ban has been heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, which has yet to issue a ruling that could determine the legality of such bans nationwide. The administration of former President Joe Biden, a Democrat, supported access to puberty blockers and hormones, though not surgery, for transgender minors. It passed a rule banning discrimination against transgender people in healthcare, which was blocked by a judge last year. The American Academy of Pediatrics has said that gender-affirming care is proven to prevent suicide and improve mental health. Health organizations in some other countries have been more guarded, with the European Academy of Paediatrics calling for more research and a government-sponsored review in England concluding that the existing evidence around youth gender care is weak. </div>",

            "description": "<div>Investing.com - Shares of Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) tumbled 4.4% following the announcement that its Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project will now cost more than initially expected. The company's recent update indicated a roughly 9% increase in the total project cost, from $9.8 billion to $10.7 billion, primarily due to higher network upgrade costs assigned by PJM, the regional electric grid operator, and increased onshore electrical interconnection costs.Despite the cost hike, Dominion Energy reported that the CVOW project, a 2.6 GW fully permitted offshore wind initiative, is about 50% complete and on schedule to finish by the end of 2026. The project is credited with creating 2,000 jobs and generating $2 billion in economic activity. Significant construction milestones have been achieved, including the installation of the first 16 transition pieces and the delivery of major components for on-schedule installation.The updated cost reflects a revised estimate for network upgrade costs, which represented the largest unfixed cost input for the project. The company's contingency now accounts for approximately 5% of the remaining project investment. Dominion Energy reassured stakeholders that robust cost-sharing mechanisms are in place to protect both customers and shareholders from the cost increase. The expected average impact on a typical residential customer bill is projected to be an increase of 43 cents per month over the life of the project.Dominion Energy also reaffirmed its existing guidance for 2025 operating EPS (non-GAAP), its long-term operating EPS growth rate, and credit. The company will discuss its financial results, updated capital investment expectations, and financing plans during its fourth quarter 2024 investor call on February 12, 2025.Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners commented on the cost increase, stating, \"we acknowledge that some investors may place a discount on the name until they see more construction completion.\" He noted that while the cost-sharing settlement and stake sale agreement from 2022 and 2024 will limit Dominion's funding of the overage to $100 million, the remainder of the project continues on schedule with key component deliveries and installations progressing. Pourreza emphasized the importance of supplier performance and constraints within the schedule for the project's success.Dominion Energy's stock movement reflects investor concerns over the updated costs and the potential impact on the company's financials, despite assurances of cost-sharing measures and ongoing progress in the construction of the CVOW project.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

            "description": "<div>Investing.com - Equities have historically been the primary macro driver for cryptocurrency prices, but this correlation is expected to decrease as the crypto market matures, according to Citi Research strategists.<br>The speculative nature of cryptocurrencies, particularly in \"risk-off\" events, may lead to elevated correlations with risk assets. However, strategists anticipate that a more transparent regulatory regime in the US will contribute to more idiosyncratic crypto price movements.<br>“Despite a rise in 2024, longer-term volatility is likely to continue declining as integration into portfolios becomes more mainstream and as institutional adoption increases,” strategists led by Alex Saunders said in a Monday report.<br>The report also points out that cryptocurrencies were the only asset class to increase in market capitalization as a percentage of US equities throughout 2024.<br>Citi suggests that the correlation between crypto and gold is crucial to observe as it could signal Bitcoin's potential as a store of value, although they believe the term \"digital gold\" is not yet fully appropriate due to Bitcoin's current tech/equity correlation and high volatility.<br>“Bitcoin demand is much more driven by speculation and optimism for blockchain adoption, and its volatility remains quite high relative to other traditional financial assets,” the report adds.<br>The bank further notes that spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) attracted significant interest in their first year, driving returns. This trend is expected to persist, especially with regulatory clarity and broader adoption, which could lead to diminishing macro correlations. Institutional investors are likely to increase their involvement in the wake of clearer regulations.<br>In terms of portfolio management, Citi found that including Bitcoin could historically enhance returns, albeit with increased volatility. Their Black-Litterman analysis indicated that expected annual returns of 8-15% align with Bitcoin allocations of 1-5% in multi-asset portfolios.<br>The Wall Street firm also observed that Bitcoin and Ethereum share similar macro risk exposures currently but may diverge in the future due to their differing use cases.<br>Citi recommends price-based filters and rebalancing strategies, such as moving averages and quarterly adjustments, to help manage portfolio volatility. Lastly, the strategists acknowledged that neither cryptocurrencies nor equities have served as effective inflation hedges, but trend-following strategies could still be valuable, given the speculative interest in cryptocurrencies.</div>",

Companies added to the blacklist can be subject to fines and a broad range of other sanctions, including a freeze on trade and revocation of work permits for foreign staff. PVH had already been under scrutiny from Chinese regulators over \"improper\" conduct related to the Xinjiang region.  For Illumina, China accounts for about 7% of sales. Two of its Chinese rivals, MGI and BGI, were listed in a U.S. bill that aims to restrict business with several biotech companies on grounds of national security. Shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) also fell 1% to $19.20 in premarket trading after the Financial Times reported that Chinese regulators were also looking to launch a formal probe into the chipmaker.  An influential Chinese industry group called for a security review late last year against Intel's products sold in China.  The announcement was part of a string of measures by China in response to new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. China also said it was investigating Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).  However, Alphabet's shares edged up nearly 1%, as some of its key products, including its Google search engine, are already blocked in China and its revenue from the country represents only about 1% of its global sales.  Illumina's shares were down 4.1% at $125.71, while PVH's stock fell 2.4% to $80.49 before the opening bell.  </div>",

However, the market recovered some of its losses later that day following President Donald Trump's decision to delay tariffs on Mexico by 30 days.During the volatile market conditions, Aave processed a record $210 million in liquidations, the highest since the market crash on August 5. Despite the high volume of liquidations, the protocol did not incur any new bad debt. Bad debt occurs when borrowers are unable to repay loans and the collateral they provided is not enough to cover the debt, a risk that is exacerbated during market instability.Chaos Labs reported that Aave's liquidations were carried out effectively, particularly on the Ethereum Main instance, highlighting the protocol's robust risk management and liquidation systems. These mechanisms allowed Aave to settle collateralized positions and minimize losses.The performance of Aave under stress was praised by a DeFi observer known as leo, who attributed the success to the decentralized finance sector's strong foundation, which includes strict collateral management and well-designed protocols for liquidation, supported by substantial liquidity pools.Looking ahead, upgrades to Aave's system, such as version 3.3, v4, and the Umbrella updates, are set to further enhance the DeFi industry. The Aave v3.3 update, announced in December, includes features to manage uncollateralized bad debt from liquidations more efficiently and to address the accumulation of minimal, hard-to-liquidate debt known as dust debt.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

            "description": "<div>Investing.com - Shares of Applied Optoelectronics (NASDAQ:AAOI) fell 7% after a report by Culper Research accused the company of grossly misrepresenting its prospects in the 800G transceiver market. The report, which involved interviews with former employees, competitors, hyperscalers, and industry experts, as well as site visits, suggests that Applied Optoelectronics has exaggerated its ability to scale 800G production and has likely lost potential customer opportunities.Culper Research's investigation indicates that despite claims of shipping 800G samples to customers in the third quarter of 2023, these samples were not ready until much later. A former employee from Meta (formerly Facebook (NASDAQ:META)) stated that Applied Optoelectronics promised 800G samples within three quarters, but by the time the samples were available, the request for quotation (RFQ) had already closed.The report further alleges that Applied Optoelectronics has not disclosed any 800G customer and has postponed its revenue expectations from this technology by three quarters. In addition, the company's claim of re-engaging with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and being ready to ramp up production was met with dissatisfaction from the e-commerce giant, according to sources who claim Amazon was angry after Applied Optoelectronics failed to deliver on its production promises.Culper Research also challenges Applied Optoelectronics' portrayal of its relationship with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), suggesting that revenue from Microsoft has been limited to lower-end products and cables, while Microsoft has been deploying 800G transceivers from other competitors.The report casts doubt on Applied Optoelectronics' manufacturing capabilities, citing failed attempts to sell its Chinese manufacturing assets and an empty expansion site in Taiwan. Experts consulted in the report believe that significant U.S. production is unlikely due to higher costs and labor rates, contrary to CEO Lin's claims of feasibility.Applied Optoelectronics has not yet responded to the allegations made in the Culper Research report. The stock's decline reflects investor concerns over the company's ability to compete and scale production in the critical 800G market, which is key to the future of data center and telecommunications infrastructure.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.
