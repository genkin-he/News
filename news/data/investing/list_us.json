            "description": "<div> By Maggie Fick and Stine Jacobsen LONDON/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Wegovy maker Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) on Wednesday forecast sales would grow at a slower rate this year although the outlook was roughly in line with market expectations as the pace of ferocious demand for its wildly popular obesity drug Wegovy eases somewhat. The Danish company said it expects sales growth in local currencies to range between 16% and 24%, less than the 26% growth seen in 2024. That compares with analysts expectations of just under 20%. The company is also grappling with competition from Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY). It said fourth-quarter operating profit jumped 37% to 36.7 billion Danish crowns ($5.12 billion), better than the 33.6 billion forecast by analysts in a company poll. It predicted operating profit for 2025 to climb between 19% and 27%, compared to growth of 26% last year. During the fourth quarter, sales of Wegovy more than doubled to 19.9 billion crowns from 9.6 billion a year ago, in line with expectations and more than the 17.3 billion crowns achieved in the third quarter.  ($1 = 7.1674 Danish crowns) </div>",

            "description": "<div>Investing.com - GSK (LON:GSK) on Wednesday raised its long-term sales outlook, now expecting annual revenue to exceed £40 billion by 2031, an upward revision from the previous projection of £38 billion. <br>This increase reflects the company’s confidence in its expanding portfolio of specialty medicines, a strong late-stage pipeline, and anticipated success of new product launches over the coming years.<br>The pharmaceutical company reported a solid financial performance for 2024, with total sales reaching £31.4 billion, representing a 7% increase at constant exchange rates. <br>Growth was largely driven by a surge in specialty medicines, which saw a 19% rise in sales. Oncology treatments nearly doubled in revenue, while HIV and respiratory medicines also delivered double-digit gains. <br>However, the vaccines segment struggled, posting a 4% decline, with Arexvy, its respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, falling 51% in sales. <br>General medicines saw moderate growth of 6%, with Trelegy, a key respiratory drug, posting a strong 27% increase.<br>Despite strong revenue expansion, total operating profit fell by 33%, largely due to a £1.8 billion charge related to Zantac litigation settlements. <br>However, the company’s core operations remained strong, with core operating profit growing by 11%. <br>The earnings per share figures reflected this divide, with total EPS declining by 40% to 63.2p, while core EPS increased by 10% to 159.3p. <br>The company’s cash flow position remained solid, generating £8 billion from operations and ending the year with a reduced net debt of £13.1 billion, down from £15 billion.<br>GSK’s global performance showed strength across key markets. Sales in the United States reached £16.4 billion, up 6% at constant exchange rates, while Europe posted £6.7 billion in revenue, a 4% increase. <br>International markets led regional growth, climbing 11% to £8.3 billion. The company’s expansion in specialty medicines has been instrumental in this upward trajectory, with strong demand for its HIV treatments, respiratory therapies, and growing oncology presence.<br>The company’s research and development efforts continue to shape its future outlook. Currently, 71 specialty medicines and vaccines are in clinical development, with 19 in late-stage trials or under regulatory review. <br>Five major product approvals are expected in 2025, including Blenrep for multiple myeloma and depemokimab for severe asthma. Key late-stage trials in oncology, respiratory diseases, and HIV are also expected to be catalysts for long-term growth.<br>“In particular, we are increasing and prioritising R&D investment to promising new long-acting and specialty medicines in Respiratory, Immunology & Inflammation, Oncology and HIV. Our outperformance and stronger balance sheet support these investments and others planned in R&D,” said Emma Walmsley, chief executive at GSK in a statement.<br>By 2025, GSK expects turnover to grow between 3% and 5%. Core operating profit and core earnings per share are expected to grow between 6% and 8%. <br>A £2 billion share buyback program is set to be implemented over the next 18 months by the firm, a move that signals confidence in its long-term strategy. <br>Dividends are expected to increase to 64p per share in 2025, which is an increase from 61p per share in 2024.</div>",

            "description": "<div> (Reuters) - A Ukrainian drone attack overnight sparked a fire at an oil depot in Russia's southern region of Krasnodar that has since been extinguished, regional officials said on Wednesday.  A series of drone attacks by Ukraine on Russia's energy facilities have sparked fires in recent days at a major oil refinery in the Volgograd region, as well as at the Astrakhan gas processing plant.  \"The fire in a tank with oil product residues in the village of Novominskaya in the Kanevsky District was fully extinguished,\" the region's operational authorities said on the Telegram messaging app. Earlier, Veniamin Kondratyev, governor of the Krasnodar region, said that there were no injuries in the fire that was caused by a falling drone debris. A team of 19 people wielding 19 items of equipment were fighting the flames, he said.  Kondratyev did not say which depot was on fire or detail the extent of damage.  The Russian defence ministry said that four Ukrainian drones were destroyed over the Russian territory overnight, but did not mention the Krasnodar region in a statement on the Telegram messaging app. The ministry only reports drones that its air defence systems destroy, not how many were launched.  There was no immediate comment from Ukraine. Kyiv says that its attacks inside Russia are aimed at destroying infrastructure key to Moscow's war in Ukraine and are in response to Russian continued bombing of Ukraine.   </div>",

            "title": "Nissan calls off Honda merger talks, Nikkei says",
            "description": "<div> By Maki Shiraki and Daniel Leussink TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Nissan (OTC:NSANY) has called off merger talks with rival  Honda  (NYSE:HMC), the Nikkei newspaper said, abandoning a tie-up that would have created the world's no.3 automaker and raising questions about how it will drive a turnaround by itself. Shares in Nissan slid more than 4% before trade was suspended by the Tokyo Stock Exchange following the report. Shares of Honda continued to trade and finished the day up more than 8%, in a sign of apparent investor relief that the deal had been scrapped. Honda, Japan's second-largest car maker, and Nissan, its third-largest, last year said they were in discussions to merge and create the world's third-largest automaker by sales, bulking up in an industry that faces a vast threat from China's BYD (SZ:002594) and other electric vehicle entrants. But the talks have been complicated by growing differences on both sides, according to two people familiar with the matter, both of whom declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak to the media. Reuters earlier reported Nissan could call off the talks. As of late afternoon, its board was still meeting to decide on the course of action, a person with knowledge of the matter said. Honda had sounded out Nissan about becoming a subsidiary, one of the people said, adding that such an arrangement was a departure from the spirit of discussions originally framed as a merger of equals. A Nissan spokesperson said the Nikkei report was not based on information announced by the company and that it aimed to finalise its future direction by mid-February and would announce it at that time. A Honda spokesperson said it had not heard anything from Nissan about a decision to withdraw from their memorandum of understanding to work on a merger. The development raises fresh questions about how hard-hit Nissan could ride out its latest crisis without external help. Nissan is in the middle of a turnaround plan, aiming to cut 9,000 employees and 20% of global capacity. Honda, with a market value nearly five times bigger than Nissan, was increasingly worried about its smaller rival's progress on the turnaround plan, said the other person. The tie-up talks have coincided with the disruption posed by potential tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump. Tariffs against Mexico would be more painful for Nissan than for Honda or  Toyota  (NYSE:TM), according to analysts. \"Investors may get concerned about Nissan's future (and) turnaround,\" said Morningstar analyst Vincent Sun. \"Nissan also has a larger risk exposure to U.S.-Mexico tariffs than Honda and Toyota.\" CONTROL Nissan has been hit harder than some other carmakers by the shift to EVs, having never fully recovered after years of crisis sparked by the arrest and removal of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn in 2018.  \"The news saying that Nissan did not want to be a Honda subsidiary appears to highlight that control was a contentious issue,\" said Christopher Richter, Japan autos analyst at brokerage CLSA. \"Without being able to have control, Honda appears to be walking away.\" Nissan's long-term alliance partner  Renault  (EPA:RENA) had said it would be open in principle to the merger with Honda. The French automaker owns 36% of Nissan, including 18.7% through a French trust.  Nissan and Honda had initially said they planned to decide the direction of the integration by the end of January, but that was later pushed back to mid-February. Sources told Reuters last month that Nissan's smaller alliance partner Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF), which had considered joining the merger, might not do so.  </div>",

            "description": "<div> JAKARTA (Reuters) - Chinese firms control about 75% of Indonesia's nickel refining capacity, raising concern over supply chain control and environmental risks, Washington-based global security nonprofit C4ADS has said in a report. According to the report, Indonesia's 8 million metric ton refining capacity was distributed across 33 companies, but ownership tracing showed shareholder overlap, and ultimately Chinese companies controlled about three-quarters of smelting capacity as of 2023. \"As Indonesia aims to use the nickel industry for economic growth, this substantial foreign influence could limit its ability to control and shape the industry for its benefit,\" said the report, released on Tuesday. The reliance on Chinese-controlled nickel production also places U.S. and European automakers at a competitive disadvantage in the global EV market amid increasingly restrictive policies against trade with China, the report said. Nickel is a key battery component. Indonesia's mining ministry did not immediately comment. An Indonesian official said last year that Chinese companies were approaching Indonesian and South Korean firms for potential partnerships to reduce their stakes in smelters and make their product more accessible to the U.S. market. President Prabowo Subianto formed a task force to develop the downstream mineral industry with domestic financing to \"gradually reduce perception that foreigners got the most benefits,\" Mining Minister Bahlil Lahadalia said last month. The C4ADS report found that two Chinese companies, Tsingshan Holding Group and Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry Co Ltd, accounted for more than 70% of Indonesia's refining capacity as of 2023. The two were among the earliest investors when Indonesia started a push for domestic processing of nickel ore - a move that has made it the world's dominant producer. Last year, a court in Central Sulawesi sentenced two workers at Indonesia Tsingshan Stainless Steel to seven months jail for negligence that led to a fire and deaths at a Tsingshan facility in December 2023. In early 2023, two workers were killed in clashes at the PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry smelter in North Morowali owned by Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry.  Tsingshan's unit Eternal Tsingshan and Jiangsu Delong's joint-venture Obsidian Stainless Steel did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Jiangsu Delong could not immediately be reached for comment. Tsingshan has been selling stakes in some of its smelters, including an October deal with Indonesian state miner  Aneka Tambang  (JK:ANTM) for 30% of PT Jiu Long Metal Industry.  </div>",
