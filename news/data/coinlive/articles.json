            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p>Original title: <a href=\"https://cryptohayes.medium.com/the-ugly-dfba4f46ebd4\" target=\"_blank\" textvalue=\"The Ugly\">The Ugly</a></p><p>Author: Arthur Hayes, founder of BitMEX; Translator: Deng Tong, Golden Finance</p><p><em>\"The Ugly\" is the first of three articles. \"The Good\" will focus on the rise of political meme coins. \"The Bad\" will discuss the risk that US cryptocurrency holders face being deceived by the Trump administration in terms of cryptocurrency regulatory policies.</em></p><p><em>Disclaimer: I am an investor and advisor to Ethena, the parent company of the $USDe stablecoin I mentioned many times in this article.</em></p><p>\"Stop - keep thirty meters on this slope\", that's what my guide instructed me when he suddenly slowed down while we were skiing on a dormant volcano a few weeks ago. Before that, it had been cold to climb the slope. But at 1600m, something changes. </p><p>As we stop together on the ridgeline, my guide says, ‚ÄúThe last section gives me a stomach churning. The avalanche risk is too high, so we‚Äôll ski from here.‚Äù I feel differently as I detect subtle yet profound changes in the snowpack. This is why I always ski with a certified guide. A seemingly innocuous patch of terrain could seal me in a frozen tomb. One never knows if skiing a particular terrain will trigger an avalanche. Still, if the perceived probability is outside one‚Äôs comfort zone, it‚Äôs wise to stop, reassess, and change course. </p><p>For at least the first quarter, in my first post of the year, I showed the world my optimism. But as January ended, my excitement faded. I was distracted by the subtle shifts in the levels of central bank balance sheets, the pace of bank credit expansion, the relationship between the US 10-year Treasury/stock/Bitcoin prices, and the crazy $TRUMP memecoin price action. This feeling is similar to how I felt in late 2021, just before the crypto markets hit bottom. </p><p>History doesn‚Äôt repeat itself, but it always rhymes. <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>I don‚Äôt believe this bull cycle is over; however, looking at forward-looking probabilities, I think it‚Äôs more likely that we see Bitcoin prices fall to $70,000-$75,000 and then rise to $250,000 by the end of 2025 than continue higher without a substantial correction. </strong></span>As a result, Maelstrom has increased his Ethena $USDe stake to record levels and continues to take profits on several altcoin positions. We remain net long, but if my feeling is correct, then we have a lot of capital ready to buy dips in Bitcoin and big dips in many quality altcoins. </p><p>With bullish sentiment so high right now, a pullback of this magnitude would be unwelcome. Trump continues to say the right things via executive orders, improve sentiment by pardoning Ross Ulbricht, and inspire crypto spirits with his recent memecoin launch. But aside from the memecoin launch, these things were mostly expected. The rest of this article will discuss the charts and monetary policy announcements that led me to reduce my Maelstrom cryptocurrency holdings. </p><h2>U.S. Monetary Policy<br/></h2><p>There are two firm views that influence my view of U.S. monetary policy:</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>- The 10-year Treasury yield will rise to between 5% and 6% and will cause a mini financial crisis.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>- The Federal Reserve Board hates Trump but will do what is necessary to protect the financial system under the U.S. rule.</strong></span></p><p>Let me explain the interplay between these two views. <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"></span></p><h2>10-Year Treasury Bond</h2><p>The dollar is the world's reserve currency and U.S. Treasury bonds are the reserve asset. This means that if you have extra dollars, buying Treasury bonds is the safest place to store them and earn a yield. Accountants consider Treasury bonds to be risk-free, and therefore, financial institutions are allowed to borrow money and assets using almost unlimited leverage. In the end, if the value of Treasury bonds falls rapidly, the accounting fairy tale will turn into an economic nightmare and systemically important financial players will go bankrupt.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>The 10-year Treasury bond is the benchmark for pricing most medium- to long-term fixed income instruments, such as mortgages or car loans. It is the most important asset price in the dirty fiat system, and that is why the 10-year yield is so important. </strong></span></p><p>Given that every financial crisis since 1913 (the day the Fed was founded) has been ‚Äúsolved‚Äù by printing dollars, leverage has been building up in the system for over a century. As a result, the execution yields when large financial institutions fail are gradually decreasing. When the 10-year Treasury briefly broke that level, former US Treasury Secretary Bad Gurl Yellen initiated a policy of issuing more and more T-bills as a covert way of printing money. The direct result was a drop in the 10-year Treasury yield to 3.60%, a local low for this cycle. </p><p>If 5% is the level, why did the yield rise from around 4.6% to over 5%? To answer this question, we need to understand who the marginal large buyers of Treasury bonds are. </p><p>It is well known that the United States is issuing debt at a rate unparalleled in the history of the empire. The total debt now stands at $36.22 trillion, up from $16.70 trillion at the end of 2019. Who is buying this crap? </p><p>Let‚Äôs look at the usual buyers. </p><p><strong>The Federal Reserve</strong> ‚Äì The Fed ran a money-printing shenanigans called Quantitative Easing (QE) from 2008 to 2022. It bought trillions of dollars in U.S. Treasuries. However, starting in 2022, it turned off the printing presses, which is called quantitative tightening (QT). </p><p><strong>U.S. Commercial Banks</strong> ‚Äì They were getting hammered buying Treasuries at all-time highs before being hit by temporary inflation and the Fed‚Äôs fastest rate hikes in 40 years. Worse, in order to comply with the pesky capital adequacy rules set by Basel III, they can‚Äôt buy Treasuries unless they pledge more expensive equity. As a result, their balance sheets are fully utilized and they can‚Äôt buy more Treasuries. </p><p><strong>Major Foreign Surplus Countries</strong> ‚Äì I‚Äôm talking about oil exporters like Saudi Arabia and commodity exporters like China and Japan. As the dollars they earn from global trade surge, they have not been buying U.S. Treasuries. For example, China‚Äôs trade surplus as of November 2024 is $962 billion. During the same time frame, China‚Äôs holdings of Treasuries have fallen by about $14 billion. </p><p>Given that the U.S. has shoved Treasuries down the throat of the world‚Äôs financial system, there has not yet been a debt crisis. </p><p>Let‚Äôs applaud the relative value (RV) hedge funds. These funds, which are domiciled in places like the UK, the Cayman Islands, and Luxembourg for tax reasons, are marginal buyers of Treasuries. How do I know? The most recent Treasury Quarterly Refinancing Announcement (QRA) clearly states that they are marginal buyers of yield-constrained Treasuries. Moreover, if you read the monthly TIC reports published by the Treasury, you‚Äôll see that the aforementioned places have accumulated significant holdings. </p><p>Here‚Äôs how the trade works. Whenever a cash Treasuries trade at a discount to its corresponding listed futures contract, the hedge funds can profit from the basis arbitrage. [1] The basis is so small that the only way to make money is to trade billions of dollars in notional amounts. Hedge funds don't have that much idle cash, so they need to turn to the banking system for leverage. The hedge fund buys the bonds with cash, but before the cash is delivered, a repurchase agreement (repo) is made with a large bank. The hedge fund delivers the bonds and receives cash. This cash is then used to pay for the bond purchase. Voila, the hedge fund bought the bonds with someone else's money. The only money the hedge fund paid was the margin at a bond futures exchange like the CME. </p><p>In theory, RV hedge funds can buy an endless amount of treasure, provided the following conditions are true:</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>- The bank has enough balance sheet capacity to facilitate the repo.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>- The repo yield is affordable. If the yield is too high, the underlying trade will not be profitable and the hedge fund will not buy the Treasury. - Margin requirements remain low. If a hedge fund has to pay more margin to hedge its bond purchases using futures contracts, it will buy fewer bonds. Hedge funds have limited capital; if much of it is tied up in trading, they will trade less. RV hedge fund buyers are at risk due to the factors above. Bank Balance Sheet/Repo Yields: Under Basel III, balance sheets are a finite resource. Supply and demand dictate that the closer supply gets to exhaustion, the higher the price of balance sheet space. So as the Treasury issues more debt and RV hedge funds do more underlying trades, which requires more repo, using more balance sheet, at some point the price of overnight repo spikes. Once that happens, the buying stops abruptly and the Treasury market starts to collapse. <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"></span></strong></span></p><h3>Exchange Margin Requirements:</h3><p>Quite simply, the more volatile an asset is, the higher the margin requirements. When bond prices fall, volatility rises. If bond prices fall/yields rise, volatility (look at the MOVE index) spikes. When that happens, margin requirements on bond futures increase and RV hedge fund bond buying quickly decreases.</p><p>These two factors interact in a reflexive way. The question then becomes, is there a way to use monetary policy to sever the Gordon knot and allow RV hedge funds to continue financing the Treasury?</p><p>Of course, our monetary masters can always implement accounting gimmicks to fix the financial crisis. In this case, the Fed could suspend the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR). Suspending the SLR in relation to Treasury holdings and related repo allows banks to use unlimited leverage. </p><p>After the SLR waiver, here‚Äôs what happens:</p><p>- Banks can buy as many Treasuries as they want without pledging any capital, freeing up space on their balance sheets.</p><p>- With an unrestricted balance sheet, banks can facilitate repos at affordable prices.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The Treasury gains two more marginal buyers: commercial banks and RV hedge funds.</span></p><p>Bond prices rise, yields fall, margin requirements fall. Boom, happy days.</p><p>If the Fed is really feeling generous, it can stop QT and resume QE. That‚Äôs three marginal buyers.</p><p>What I wrote is not news to the Fed or the Treasury. The banking community has been begging for years for an SLR waiver like the one they got during the 2020 flu crisis. The latest Treasury Lending Advisory Committee (TABCO) report makes it clear that they need an SLR exemption and the Fed needs to start QE again to fix the Treasury market. The only thing missing is the political will of the Fed, so I take the second view. </p><h2>Fed Policy</h2><p>The comments of former and current Fed Governors and the Fed's actions during the Biden presidency lead me to believe that the Fed will do everything in its power to thwart Trump's agenda. However, there are limits to the Fed's obstruction. If the failure of large financial institutions or the solvency of the Empire itself requires changes in bank regulations, lowering the price of money, or printing money, then the Fed will not hesitate to act accordingly. <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"></span></p><h3>What did they say to Trump? </h3><p>Here are two quotes, the first from former Fed Governor William Dudley (who served as president of the New York Fed from 2009 to 2018), the second from Powell:</p><p><em>U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs trade war with China continues to undermine business and consumer confidence and worsen the economic outlook. This manufactured disaster has put the Fed in a dilemma: Should it mitigate the damage by providing offsetting stimulus, or refuse to cooperate? ‚Ä¶ Officials can make it clear that the central bank will not bail out an administration that repeatedly makes poor choices on trade policy, making it clear that Trump will face the consequences of his actions ‚Ä¶ Some even argue that the election itself falls within the Fed‚Äôs purview. After all, Trump‚Äôs reelection arguably poses a threat to the U.S. and global economies, the Fed‚Äôs independence, and its ability to achieve its employment and inflation goals. </em></p><p><em>‚Äì The Fed Should Not Coddle Donald Trump, William Dudley</em></p><p>When asked at the policy meeting press conference how the Fed views Trump‚Äôs recent victory, Powell said that <em>‚Äúsome did take a very preliminary step to start incorporating highly conditional estimates of the impact of policy on the economy into their forecasts.‚Äù</em>This is interesting. Before the election, one set of economic estimates was used to lower rates and help Harris, but now a different set of estimates is being considered because of Trump‚Äôs victory. In fact, the Fed should have used the same estimates in the months leading up to the election. But what do I know? I‚Äôm just a crypto fool. <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"></span></p><h3>What did they do for Biden?</h3><p>In the beginning, inflation was temporary. Remember? Powell claimed in all seriousness that the inflation spike caused directly by the most money printing in the shortest period of time in US history was just a blip that would soon go away. Four years later, inflation has been running above their own manipulated, stupid, dishonest inflation measure. They use this sophistry to prevent the inevitable rate hikes from starting until 2022, knowing that it could lead to a financial crisis or recession. They are not wrong; the Fed is directly responsible for the regional banking crisis of 2023. </p><p>Then the Fed plays dumb. Yellen completely nullifies their monetary tightening campaign by issuing more T-bills to exhaust the Reverse Repurchase Program (RRP) starting in September 2022. At least the Fed can oppose the Treasury since they are supposedly independent of the federal government. </p><p>The Fed pauses rate hikes in September 2023, when inflation is still above target. In September 2024, they fuel money printing by initiating a rate cut cycle. Is inflation below their target? Not yet. </p><p>The Fed talks a lot about keeping inflation in check, but when it becomes a political imperative to keep government money flowing at affordable prices and stimulate financial asset markets, the Fed acts. It becomes a political imperative because the Biden administration was screwed from the start. In hindsight, the claim that Biden is a fraud may also be true. Regardless, in order to prevent the Republicans from taking back the House and Senate and Trump from winning reelection in 2024, the Fed did whatever it took to prevent a financial and economic crisis. <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"></span></p><h3>What did they do for the system? </h3><p>In some cases, the Fed went beyond the call of duty to help the Democrats. For example, in response to the regional banking crisis in early 2023, the Fed created the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). The rate hike regime and subsequent bond crash led to a financial disaster, with banks losing money on the Treasury bonds they purchased at all-time high prices between 2020 and 2021. The Fed took notice of this corruption and, after letting three crypto-friendly banks fail to appease Pocahontas (U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren), it essentially backstopped $4 trillion worth of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities on the balance sheets of U.S. banks. </p><p>In hindsight, BTFP may have been an overkill. However, the Fed wants markets to have no doubt that it will preemptively fire the printing presses at full steam if there is a significant threat to the financial system under American rule. </p><h2>Powell the Traitor</h2><p>Powell is a traitor because he was appointed by Trump in 2018. This is not surprising, as the full force of Trumpism was weakened by a group of disloyal lieutenants during his first term. Whether you think this is a good or bad thing is irrelevant; the point is that the relationship between Trump and Powell is toxic at this point. After Trump's recent victory over Biden, Powell immediately quelled any doubts about a possible resignation; he intends to serve until May 2026. </p><p>Trump has often argued that the Fed must lower interest rates to make America great again. Powell responded, in his way, by saying that the Fed is ‚Äúdata dependent,‚Äù meaning they do whatever they want and tell the interns in their basement to make up some economic mumbo jumbo to justify their decisions. Remember DSGE, IS/LM, and the Ricardian equivalence? All of that is bullshit unless you work in the Marriner Eccles building. </p><p>How did Trump get the Fed on his side? He allowed a mini financial crisis to happen. Here‚Äôs one possible solution:</p><p>Continue to run huge deficits, which would require the Treasury to issue lots of debt. It‚Äôs telling that Trump chose Elon Musk to lead a meme department with no real power. Musk wouldn‚Äôt be as rich as he is without the billions of dollars the government has given Tesla in the form of subsidies and tax breaks. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is not a federal department because creating one requires congressional approval. It‚Äôs a glorified advisory role that reports to Trump. <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>Musk‚Äôs power is purely meme. </strong></span>Memes are powerful, but they won‚Äôt cut health benefits and defense spending; only direct action by lawmakers can accomplish those difficult tasks. Why would a politician do this and jeopardize their reelection chances in 2026?</p><p>An immediate fight over the debt ceiling. Presumptive Treasury Secretary Bessant has many tools to head off a shutdown date. Yellen used them in the summer of 2023 when she was fighting the debt ceiling. Drawings from the Treasury General Account (TGA) provide fiscal stimulus to markets and keep the government well-funded for months; this delays the point at which politicians must reach a compromise to allow the Treasury to borrow again. Bessant can sit on the sidelines and not spend the TGA money. The Treasury market will grind to a halt, and nervous traders will sell Treasury bonds because they fear a default.</p><p>This recipe for a flammable cocktail will quickly push the 10-year Treasury yield above 5%. If Bessant confirms the debt ceiling date, and his department does not cut the TGA to keep the government running for a few months, this could happen in a matter of days.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>As Treasury yields soar, the stock market will plunge, and some large financial institutions in the US or abroad will come under great pressure.</strong></span>The Fed will be in a political dilemma, and in order to save the system, they will do some or all of the following:</p><p>- Provide SLR exemptions for Treasury bonds</p><p>- Cut interest rates significantly</p><p>- Stop QE</p><p>- Restart QE</p><p>Trump will then praise the Fed for its commitment to the US, and financial markets will re-energize.</p><p>The problem I described above could turn into a crisis caused by uncertainty about the debt ceiling now or later; the timing is up to Trump. The longer the crisis begins under Trump, the more likely he and his Republican Party will be blamed for a crisis that is largely due to the leverage accumulated during the Biden administration. In transactional terms, Trump must fix it once and for all. Voters must blame Biden and the Democrats, not Trump and the Republicans, for the crisis ‚Äî otherwise Trumpism and Make America Great Again will become another stillborn American political movement that lasts less than two years until the Democrats return to power in the 2026 midterm elections. </p><p>The money printing spurt will come, but only if the Fed stands with Team Trump. The Fed is not the only game in town; is the banking system creating credit? </p><p><img alt=\"pZ3jizD7PdbQCfLqnA5LLOLx0i65Zhv84ohmUXtP.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346741_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7346741\"/></p><p>No, as you can see from my custom bank credit index, it is the sum of bank reserves and other deposits and liabilities held by the Fed. </p><p>Credit must flow. If the pace of credit creation disappoints, the market will give back Trump‚Äôs shock. Let‚Äôs move on to China.</p><h2>China‚Äôs stimulus</h2><p>In the third quarter of last year, the People‚Äôs Bank of China (PBOC) announced a series of measures aimed at stimulating the economy. They cut bank reserve requirements, began buying Chinese government bonds (CGBs), and helped local governments refinance their debt burdens, to name just a few. This triggered a wild rally in the A-share market.</p><p><img alt=\"ffaKZckXksIkfMX4WCbqEyDQh4dE53S91G7xpEAl.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346742_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7346742\"/></p><p>If your TikTok-swiping brain can‚Äôt figure out when the PBOC and the central government announced their reflationary policies, I circled them for you. Above is the Shanghai Composite Index. </p><p>I have pointed out that the Chinese government was prepared to let the RMB depreciate if necessary, as a result of the RMB credit expansion program.</p><p><img alt=\"lPvPA6xwY6bMXLvnRwgqYIX4NKCcfHTlNwCPVRsn.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346744_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7346744\"/></p><p>The USD/RMB was allowed to appreciate, which meant that the USD would strengthen and the RMB would weaken. Everything went according to plan, but in early January, the Chinese government changed course.</p><p>On January 9, the People's Bank of China announced that it would end its bond purchase program. As can be seen in the above chart, the People's Bank of China intervened in the market and began to manipulate the RMB to strengthen. On the one hand, the central bank could not use RMB domestically to ease financial conditions, and on the other hand, it could destroy RMB to strengthen the currency.</p><h2>Japan's interest rate policy</h2><p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) fulfilled its promise to continue raising interest rates. In their most recent meeting, they raised the policy rate by 0.25% to 0.50%. The consequence of the rate normalization program is that the central bank's balance sheet growth has stagnated. </p><p><img alt=\"cAHWgDyrVnNpfElZzQPEoomK1eez8gj7eng1W8sC.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346745_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7346745\"/></p><p>With the policy rate rising, Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields have also reached their lowest level in nearly 15 years. </p><p>The quantity of money is growing much slower than in modern times, while its price is rising rapidly. This is not a good time for the price of fiat-priced financial assets to rise. </p><p>USD/JPY is topping out. I believe USD/JPY will reach 100 (weaker USD, stronger JPY) in the next 3-5 years. As I have written extensively, the strengthening of the yen has caused Japanese companies to repatriate trillions of dollars in capital, and anyone who has borrowed in yen has had to sell assets as their holding costs have soared. The main concern in the fiat financial markets is how this sell-off will negatively impact Treasury prices. This is a long-term structural headwind that Bessent must deal with. It will eventually be dealt with using printed dollars issued through some kind of swap line facility, but until then, the pain must be felt to provide the political cover to provide the needed monetary support. Eroding Correlations</p><p>I have already explained why fiat liquidity conditions in the USD, RMB, and JPY are not conducive to price appreciation in fiat financial assets. Now, let me explain what this means for Bitcoin and crypto capital markets.</p><h2>Bond Investor Concerns</h2><p>We need to discuss what bond investors are worried about in Pax Americana. I will spend some time drawing conclusions from an excellent chart produced by Bianco Research that shows the price correlation of stocks and bonds over the 1-year and 5-year periods. </p><p><img alt=\"t4oi9EARJarBiCApYjlEie70JlJRwFbKi7hA0YPw.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346746_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7346746\"/></p><p>Inflation was the nightmare of American investors from the 1970s to the early 2000s. Therefore, stock and bond prices were correlated. As inflation raged and had a negative impact on the economy, investors sold bonds and stocks at the same time. After China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, the situation changed. American capitalists could outsource the US manufacturing base to China in exchange for better corporate profits at home, and growth rather than inflation became the main concern. In this case, falling bond prices meant that growth was accelerating, so stocks should do well. Stocks and bonds became uncorrelated. </p><p>As you can see, the one-year correlation surged in 2021, when inflation re-emerged during the COVID-19 crisis and hit a 40-year high. In the early stages of the Fed's rate hike cycle that began in early 2022, bond prices fell in lockstep with stocks. The relationship between stocks and bonds reverted to that of the 1970s-2000s. Inflation was the biggest concern. </p><p>This was clearly shown by the performance of the 10-year Treasury when the Fed paused rate hikes in September 2023 and began cutting rates in September 2024, when inflation was still above its 2% target. </p><p>Three charts below: Fed Funds Rate Cap (white) vs. 10-Year Treasury Yield (yellow)</p><p><img alt=\"wx5U6062vt7K1BuautnKcqyd1LrJs8fWXflbSGOD.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346747_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7346747\"/></p><p><img alt=\"UI4ipbc9hYDY37aFSqHdK0sZGkOt4Sbg5h9Pb2n7.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346748_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7346748\"/></p><p>As you can see, the market is worried about inflation because yields are rising even though the Fed is easing monetary conditions. </p><p><img alt=\"dc9Y60tiUPu75qHo892krbjErt1dMH5lBBlnUEwG.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346749_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7346749\"/></p><p>Contrast the first two charts with the last rate cut cycle, which began in late 2018 and ended in March 2020. As you can see, yields fell when the Fed cut rates. </p><p>No matter what anyone says, money prices always affect fiat assets. Tech stocks are very sensitive to interest rates. You can think of them as a bond with an infinite maturity or duration. Simple math tells you that when you increase the discount rate on an infinite cash flow, its present value goes down. This math comes to the fore when the financial dysfunction yields hit the strike price. </p><p><img alt=\"U1hblaFWviifkeEwxKAWPOJzp7qazogHXrPCRJCj.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346750_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7346750\"/></p><p>The chart above shows the Nasdaq 100 (white) versus the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield (yellow). At around 5%, stocks fell as yields rose, and rallied sharply when yields fell. This is part of a financial system focused on inflation rather than growth. </p><p>Let's put this together. The dollar, yuan, and yen are interchangeable in global financial markets. They all have their way into U.S. big tech stocks in some form or another. You may not like it, but it's true. I've just laid out step-by-step why, at least in the short term, the U.S., China, and Japan are not speeding up fiat money creation and, in some cases, raising the price of money. Inflation remains high and is likely to rise further in the near future as the world economies decouple. That is why I expect the 10-year yield to rise. What will happen to the stock market if it rises because of inflation fears and a rapidly increasing US debt with no marginal buyers in sight? The stock market will plummet. </p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>In the long term, Bitcoin is not correlated with stock prices, but in the short term the correlation can be high. This is the 30-day correlation of Bitcoin with the Nasdaq 100. The correlation is high and rising. If stocks fall because the 10-year yield rises, this is not good for short-term price predictions. </strong></span></p><p>Another belief of mine is that <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>Bitcoin is the only truly global free market that exists. </strong></span>It is extremely sensitive to global fiat liquidity conditions; therefore, if a fiat liquidity crunch is imminent, its price will fall before stocks and will be a leading indicator of financial stress. If it is a leading indicator, then Bitcoin will bottom before stocks, predicting that the fiat money printing spigot will reopen.</p><p>If financial stress is due to a bond market crash, then the answer from the authorities will be to print money. First, the Fed will stand with Team Trump and do their patriotic duty‚Ä¶press the dat USD Brrr button. Then, China can reflate with the Fed without suffering currency weakness. Remember, everything is relative, and if the Fed creates more dollars, the People's Bank of China can create more yuan and the USD/CNY exchange rate will remain the same. The largest holdings of Japanese companies are in US dollar financial assets. Therefore, if the prices of the above assets fall, the Bank of Japan will pause its rate hike plans and ease financial conditions for the yen.</p><p>In short, a small financial crisis in the United States will provide the monetary mana that cryptocurrencies crave. It will also be politically expedient for Trump. Overall, this gives me a 60% confidence interval for the above scenario in Q1 or early Q2. <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"></span></p><h2>Trading Probability and Expected Value</h2><p>As mentioned in the introduction, the increased risk of avalanches prevents us from continuing to ski. The key is not to fool around and not to find out. Extending this metaphor to cryptocurrencies, Maelstrom will hedge himself by underinvesting in the market. It's all about expected value, not whether I'm right. </p><p>How do I know I'm wrong? You never know, but in my opinion, if Bitcoin trades strongly with volume above $110,000 (a level reached during the peak of the $TRUMP memecoin mania) and the open interest continues to expand, then I would throw in the towel and buy back in with higher risk. More precisely, it's crazy that $TRUMP memecoin rose to a fully diluted value of nearly $100 billion in 24 hours. I bought it a few hours after its launch and sold it halfway through a weekend spa vacation. My travel expenses were paid for many times with just a few clicks on a smartphone. Trading shouldn‚Äôt be that easy, but it is during the manic phase. In my opinion, $TRUMP is a top signal, just like FTX buying the rights to the MLB umpire logo in the 2021 bull run. </p><p>Trading is not about being right or wrong, it‚Äôs about trading perceived probabilities and maximizing expected value. Let me explain my thought process. Obviously, these are perceived probabilities that can never be objectively known, but the game of investing involves making decisions with incomplete information. </p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>Why do I believe Bitcoin will have a 30% correction? </strong></span>I have been trading this market for over a decade and through three bull cycles. Given Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility, this type of pullback has occurred frequently throughout the bull run. What‚Äôs more, the market surpassed its all-time high in March 2024, right after Trump won reelection in early November 2024. Many people, myself included, have written extensively about how Trumpism portends an acceleration in money printing in the US and how other countries will boost their domestic economies with money printing programs. I think we will fall back to our previous all-time highs and give back all of the gains from Trump. 60% chance of a 30% correction in Bitcoin 40% chance of a continued bull run and a 10% increase in Bitcoin buybacks (60% * -30%) + (40% * 10%) = -14% expected value The math tells me that my approach to reducing risk is correct. I reduce risk by selling Bitcoin for the long term and holding more of my funds as collateral in USDe, which currently yields about 10% to 20% annually. If Bitcoin plummets, it will be Armageddon in the altcoin space, which is where I really want to play. As mentioned at the outset, Maelstrom has many liquid altcoin positions due to various early stage investments and advisory placements. We sold most of them. If Bitcoin drops 30%, the best quality stuff will sell for over 50%. The last super liquidation candle in Bitcoin will tell me when to reverse and buy crypto alts. </p><p>Let me repeat; if I am wrong, my downside is that we took profits early and sold some of the Bitcoin we purchased with our previous altcoin investment profits. But if I am right, then we have cash to quickly double or triple our money on the quality altcoins that took advantage of the general crypto market sell-off. </p><p>As a final note, when this article was delivered to my editor on the trading day of Monday, January 27, 2025, the market was in full panic mode as investors reassessed their bullish case for NVIDIA and American tech exceptionalism due to the launch of DeepSeek. Nasdaq futures were falling and cryptocurrencies were falling with them. DeepSeek is an AI model developed by a Chinese team that reportedly costs 95% less to train, yet outperforms the latest and greatest models from OpenAI and Anthropic. The problem with bubbles is that when investors start questioning one core tenet of their bullishness, they start questioning them all. And my concern is that they believe interest rates don‚Äôt matter. The panic among Western investors over DeepSeek may be the catalyst for their own panic about the current poor fiat liquidity situation and the secular rise in 10-year Treasury yields. Isn‚Äôt it interesting that China is embracing the open source movement while capitalist America clings to its walled garden? Competition is a beautiful thing. </p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p><strong>Is your current situation of speculating in cryptocurrencies in the past year the same: you are always one step behind the media in grabbing hot spots, you only chase high prices after seeing KOL propaganda, you can never hold on to the coins you bought, and you can never get out of them after holding on. </strong></p><p>In the final analysis, it‚Äôs not that you don‚Äôt have opportunities, but that the information is slow, the rhythm is chaotic, and the emotions collapse first. For example, in the recent TRUMP hot spot, many KOLs and smart money addresses made a lot of money in just a few days, but you are wandering between missing out and FOMO, and your anxiety is directly maxed out. <strong>What did these winners do right? </strong></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><img alt=\"5Zbxqgx1yK6Tdn2h7a3VtA9lrAGjGuT1D1MZX0FF.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346728_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7346728\"/></strong></p><h2><strong>Can you really get information effectively? </strong>¬†</h2><p>Many people focus on the so-called \"smart money\" movements, but it is far from enough. <strong>One of the real keys is to capture the emotional fluctuations on social media, especially those led by</strong><strong>KOL</strong><strong>or the community. The heat of the market often comes from the fermentation of these hot topics - the discussion and community sentiment on social platforms are the real signals of short-term opportunities. </strong>Although everyone understands that the rise and fall of the market is often not only driven by technology, but also by the emotional fluctuations of social media, these emotions are always ignored. ¬†</p><p><strong>The most difficult thing is that the media will report the hot spots of the market at the first time, but you may not have enough interpretation ability to quickly judge the true value and potential impact of this information. </strong>Whenever you see news reported by a certain media, it is often biased or one-sided, and you can only rely on your intuition to filter out the valuable parts, ignoring the complex signals that may be hidden behind it. ¬†</p><p><strong>And now your time is fragmented. Every time you want to find key information, you will be overwhelmed by various scattered resources. News media, social platforms, and KOL's dynamics are all scattered in different places. As a result, you have to flip through more than a dozen tabs to piece together a little useful content, which is time-consuming and laborious, and finally find that the information is still incomplete. </strong>¬†</p><p>Don't mention those more experienced players. For example, when some people do currency analysis, they need to repeatedly try to search on Twitter with various keywords such as currency name, project name, contract address, etc. before they can find relevant content. Twitter itself has messy content and does not support information query classified by currency. High-quality information is like looking for a needle in a haystack. In addition, most of the content on Twitter is in English. If you want to understand it, you can only translate it one post at a time, which is really a waste of time. At the same time, mainstream media are constantly publishing reports about this information, but you lack the ability to analyze and interpret information in depth. ¬†</p><p>If you are a novice in the currency circle, the situation is even worse. You have no idea where to find relevant content, let alone which KOLs are worth paying attention to and which media information is high-quality. By the time you finally start to pay attention to a hot spot, the market opportunity has already slipped away. At this time, the rapid media coverage may have exacerbated market volatility and caused you to miss real opportunities. ¬†</p><p>But now, these problems are no longer problems! <strong>Because</strong><strong>OKX</strong><strong>has launched a new</strong><strong>‚Äú</strong><strong>Dynamics</strong><strong>‚Äù</strong><strong>feature and integrated it into</strong><strong>Web3</strong><strong>wallets!</strong><strong>If you have also encountered the above problems, then you should quickly experience this product feature!</strong>¬†</p><h2><strong>What is the use of the</strong><strong>OKX</strong><strong>‚Äú</strong><strong>Dynamics</strong><strong>‚Äù</strong><strong>feature?</strong>¬†</h2><p>In short, the<strong>OKX</strong><strong>‚Äú</strong><strong>Dynamics</strong><strong>‚Äù</strong><strong>feature is a one-stop industry information resource library, designed for users of different levels, whether you are a newbie or a veteran player, it can help you quickly find the matching content you need and improve the quality of trading decisions.</strong></p><p><strong>The \"Dynamics\" function helps you quickly obtain important information and intelligently classify it by real-time aggregation of industry media news, KOL dynamics and market discussions. </strong>It is organized not only by currency, but also by theme, effectively solving the problem of information overload and fragmentation. For those who are new to the industry, it helps you quickly find key content and influential KOL resources, allowing you to quickly grasp industry trends; while for experienced users, it helps you focus on the core content, avoid the interference of irrelevant information, and ensure that you always pay attention to the most important market dynamics. </p><p><strong>Secondly, another highlight of the \"Dynamics\" function is the intelligent screening through AI technology to accurately locate the core information. No matter which currency you are interested in, you no longer need to try keywords such as project name, token abbreviation, contract address, etc. on multiple platforms. AI will provide news, discussions and KOL opinions related to your interests based on your focus, allowing you to focus on truly valuable content. This precise screening mechanism improves the efficiency of information acquisition, helping you save time and speed up decision-making. </strong></p><p><strong>In addition, the built-in real-time translation function of </strong><strong>\"</strong><strong>Dynamics</strong><strong>\" solves the problem of global language barriers. </strong>The hot spots in the crypto market often heat up first from overseas discussions, but language barriers cause many users to miss key information. The OKX \"Dynamics\" function has built-in real-time translation technology, whether it is English information on Twitter or discussions in other languages, it can be presented synchronously in the language you are familiar with. From the views of KOLs in the Chinese and English circles to the preferences of other countries for Tokens, you can see at a glance and easily understand the global market dynamics. The \"Dynamics\" function not only breaks the boundaries of language, but also allows you to gain insight into market trends from a global perspective, make decisions from a broader perspective, and seize opportunities in changes. </p><h2><strong>How to use it quickly? </strong>¬†</h2><p><strong>OKX</strong><strong>launched</strong><strong>the</strong><strong>‚Äú</strong><strong>Following</strong><strong>the</strong><strong>news</strong><strong>feature</strong><strong>on</strong><strong>both</strong><strong>the</strong><strong>exchange</strong><strong>and</strong><strong>Web3</strong><strong>wallet</strong><strong>, becoming</strong><strong>the</strong><strong>first</strong><strong>exchange</strong><strong>to</strong><strong>provide</strong><strong>Twitter</strong><strong>and</strong><strong>news</strong><strong>aggregation</strong><strong>on</strong><strong>both</strong><strong>the</strong><strong>exchange</strong><strong>and</strong><strong>the ...you</strong><strong>with</strong><strong>the</strong><strong>news</strong><strong>feature</strong><strong>in</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>d</strong><strong>way</strong><strong>,</strong><strong>so</strong><strong>you</strong><strong>can</strong><strong>use</strong><strong>automatic</strong><strong>capture</strong><strong>information,</strong><strong>enabling</strong><strong> </strong></p><p>For DEX users, OKX's Web3 wallet function also brings huge improvements. Traditionally, when you make a trading decision, you usually need to check multiple information platforms, such as news websites, Twitter, or specialized analysis tools, and then go to DEX to trade. This process not only disperses information, but also leads to delays in decision-making. <strong>However, </strong><strong>OKX</strong><strong>'s </strong><strong>\" ... Currently, OKX provides two entrances: Entrance 1: Click \"Discover\" - \"Opportunities\" - \"Dynamics\" in the OKX App to view the overall dynamics. Click any dynamic to enter the full text page, or click the \"Translate\" button to view the original text or translation, or click \"Original Source\" to jump to the corresponding original page. 2) Entrance 2: Click \"Dynamics\" on any currency trading page to view all dynamic news about the currency.

By improving transparency, OKX ensures the openness and fairness of market information, helping users make more informed decisions. At the same time, the efficient operation of the platform enables every user to seize opportunities in the ever-changing market, achieve rapid response and accurate transactions.</p><p>OKX's \"Dynamic\" function is not only a reflection of technological innovation, but also a precise response to users' deep needs. <strong>It fundamentally solves two core problems: How to efficiently extract valuable information from complex data streams? And how to respond quickly when information is lagging? </strong></p><p>When information becomes the engine that drives the market forward, mastering the initiative of information flow becomes the key to determining the future direction. Through the \"Dynamic\" function, OKX is no longer limited to traditional information dissemination, but creates a new information ecology through real-time market dynamics and intelligent analysis. This means that users can receive key market information at the same speed and at the first time no matter where they are, breaking the time lag in information transmission and significantly improving the efficiency and accuracy of trading decisions. </p><p>The innovation of the \"Dynamic\" function is not only an optimization of the way of information transmission, but also breaks through the traditional information barriers through technical means, promoting the openness and transparency of the market. Users on the OKX platform are not only traders, but also participants in information flow and promoters of market evolution. In this sense, what OKX \"Dynamic\" provides is not only a trading tool, but also a new perspective, allowing you to gain insight into micro-changes in a complex market environment and go further. </p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p><p>This content is for reference only and does not constitute and should not be considered as (i) investment advice or recommendation, (ii) an offer or solicitation to buy, sell or hold digital assets, or (iii) financial, accounting, legal or tax advice.

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p>Author: Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer, Bitwise; Jeff Park, Portfolio Manager, Head of Alpha Strategies; Translator: 0xjs@ÈªÑÈáëË¥¢Áªè</p><p>The cryptocurrency market fell sharply in the past few days, with Bitcoin down about 5% and many other assets falling even more. As I wrote this article on Monday morning in London (where I was attending a conference), Ethereum fell 17%, Solana fell 8%, and XRP fell 18%.</p><p>The direct cause of the decline is concerns about a global trade war. Last weekend, President Trump imposed a 25% tariff on most imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on China, and the three countries announced corresponding response plans. The move caused the dollar to rise by more than 1% against other major currencies and caused stock futures and cryptocurrency prices to fall sharply.</p><p>Of course, since this is crypto technology, the trouble is not just that.</p><p>In the field of cryptocurrencies, due to the widespread use of leverage, sharp market fluctuations (especially on weekends with low liquidity) tend to be self-exacerbated. Negative news events cause prices to pull back, which causes leveraged traders to close their positions by selling, which causes prices to keep falling, forcing more people to close their positions. This process continues until leverage is exhausted. </p><p>Sure enough, the largest liquidation event in crypto history occurred in the 24 hours from Sunday night to Monday morning, with perhaps as much as $10 billion in leveraged positions being liquidated. </p><p>Bitwise investors tend to be long-term investors, so these short-term, leverage-driven pullbacks are viewed by most as opportunities rather than threats - as long as the news event is truly short-term. </p><p>So, is it really so? That's the trillion-dollar question. </p><p>My colleague Jeff Park, who leads Bitwise's Alpha team, is one of the sharpest minds at the intersection of macro and crypto. His view is that <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>Trump's economic game plan, including the implementation of tariffs, is actually a long-term positive catalyst for Bitcoin. </strong></span></p><p>I asked Jeff to share his perspective below:</p><p>The upshot is: <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\">Bitcoin wins, fiat loses. In either case, Bitcoin goes higher.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>To understand the long-term impact of tariffs on Bitcoin, there are two things to remember: 1) the curse of the ‚ÄúTriffin Dilemma,‚Äù and 2) President Trump‚Äôs long-term goals.</strong></span></p><p>The first is the ‚ÄúTriffin Dilemma.‚Äù Named after the Belgian-American economist who coined the term in the 1960s, the dilemma refers to the fact that being the world‚Äôs reserve currency has both advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>On the negative side, the dollar is structurally overvalued because other countries need it as a reserve currency (regardless of its price), and the U.S. must run a persistent trade deficit to supply dollars to the world. On the plus side, the U.S. government can continue to borrow at a lower cost than it ‚Äúshould‚Äù because there are consistent buyers for its debt. </p><p>Trump wants to eliminate the negatives and keep the positives. </p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>How does Trump plan to achieve this? Tariffs. </strong></span></p><p>Tariffs are usually temporary negotiating tools to achieve a goal - that seems to be the case this time. <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>We believe the ultimate goal is to reach a multilateral agreement that weakens the dollar without raising long-term interest rates. </strong></span>One possible way to do this is to force countries to reduce their dollar reserves while extending the maturity of Treasury bonds. This would suppress long-term interest rates while supporting the U.S. manufacturing base. </p><p>But how do you get countries to agree to this? You have to force them to the negotiating table. </p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\">The US has done this before. In 1985, West Germany, France, the UK, and Japan signed the famous Plaza Accord, which <strong>called for an orderly devaluation of the dollar against other currencies. </strong>The agreement was a huge boost to US manufacturers, which had previously struggled to compete on the global stage due to the strength of the dollar. (Why did these countries sign the agreement? One reason was‚Äîyou guessed it‚Äîthe fear of tariffs.)</span></p><p><strong>If Trump can bully his way to this outcome, there is no asset more favorable than Bitcoin. Lower interest rates will stimulate risk appetite among US investors, pushing up Bitcoin prices. Abroad, countries will face economic weakness and will resort to traditional economic stimulus to compensate, again pushing up Bitcoin prices.</strong></p><p>What if he fails? What if we get a prolonged tariff war? We firmly believe that the resulting economic weakness will lead to more money printing than ever before. Historically, such stimulus has been very bullish for Bitcoin.</p></div></div>",

            "title": "SEC Commissioner Peirce: Top Ten Tasks for the Crypto Working Group to Do in the Future",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p>Author: SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce; Translator: Deng Tong, Golden Finance</p><p>When I was a kid, my family made an annual road trip from Ohio to Maine and back. It was a different time. There were no cell phones to call for help if the car broke down. Paper maps and directions were written on scraps of paper, not cell phone apps that gave you step-by-step instructions. Forget booking a hotel online; you just looked for the sign in the distance and stopped to see if there was a vacancy. There were no podcasts or audiobooks, just a noisy radio trying to find a local station. Instead of watching videos on the back screen, my brothers and I scanned the license plates of passing cars and ‚Äúcollected‚Äù states in a technology-free game of road trip. Today‚Äôs road trips are very different. In most ways, technology has made them a more fun and less risky activity.</p><p>The crypto journeys that the newly announced Crypto Task Force[1] is embarking on should similarly be more fun and less risky than the ones the Commission has led the industry on for the past decade. On that last journey, the Commission refused to use the regulatory tools at its disposal and kept pumping the enforcement brakes as it lurched forward on a winding route with no one knowing where to go. But just as modern technology does not eliminate the risks of taking the open road, this new journey toward regulatory clarity remains perilous, and both the Commission and the public need to remain vigilant and aware of the risks and opportunities that may exist. I am grateful to have an excellent team of talented SEC staff accompanying me on this journey, and we look forward to engaging with the many passionate members of the public who will help us navigate this journey. With all of this help, I am hopeful that we can arrive in a better place than we ever imagined on our previous cryptocurrency journeys. Before I discuss the hopes and opportunities that the Working Group represents, let me start with some important disclaimers. </p><p>First, while I am currently entrusted with the important task of leading the SEC‚Äôs new Cryptocurrency Working Group, the views expressed are my own as a Commissioner and do not represent the views of the SEC or my fellow Commissioners. Commission positions always require a Commission vote. </p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>Second, it took a long time to get into this mess, and it will take some time to get out of it. </strong></span>The Commission has been involved in the crypto industry in one form or another for more than a decade. The first bitcoin exchange-traded product application came before us in 2013, and the same year the Commission filed a fraud case involving a crypto element. [2] In 2017, we issued the DAO Section 21(a) Report, which reflected the first application of the Howey test in this context. [3] Since then, there have been numerous enforcement actions, many no-action letters, some exemptions from relief, endless talk about crypto in speeches and statements, numerous meetings with crypto entrepreneurs, many interagency and international crypto working groups, discussions of certain aspects of crypto in proposed rulemakings, consideration of crypto-related issues in reviews of registration statements and other filings, and approval of numerous SRO-proposed rule changes to list crypto exchange-traded products. Throughout this time, the Commission‚Äôs treatment of cryptocurrencies has been marked by legal laxity and commercial impracticality. As a result, many cases remain in litigation, many rules remain in proposals, and many market participants remain in uncertainty. Determining how best to unravel all of these issues, including ongoing litigation, will take time. It will involve work across the agency and in collaboration with other regulators. Please be patient. The Task Force wants to achieve good results, but we need to do so in an orderly, practical, and legal manner. </p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>Third, the Task Force wants to get to a place where people are free to experiment and build interesting things, and where it is not a haven for fraudsters. </strong></span>One of the reasons that U.S. capital markets are so strong, efficient, and effective is that we have rules in place that are designed to protect investors and the integrity of our markets, and we enforce them. We have no tolerance for liars, cheaters, and scammers. As the Task Force works to help develop this regulatory framework, it will carefully consider anti-fraud protections. If the Commission finds that fraud is beyond our jurisdiction, it can refer the matter to sister regulators. If it does not fall within the jurisdiction of any regulator, the Commission can notify Congress of the loophole. </p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>Fourth, the Task Force is working to help create a regulatory framework that both achieves the Commission‚Äôs important regulatory goals (including protecting investors) and preserves the industry‚Äôs ability to provide products and services. </strong></span>That framework will be within the Commission‚Äôs statutory authority, and we will work with other regulators operating within their statutory authority. Existing regulations do not allow products under our jurisdiction to compete freely. Congress has set the parameters, and the Commission will apply them. Congress has also given us waivers, and the Commission will use them where appropriate. If Congress directs the Commission to impose requirements on market participants, SEC rules will not let you do whatever you want, whenever you want. Some of these rules will impose costs and other compliance burdens that some people may find irritating, and the Commission will use its enforcement tools to pursue violations when necessary. </p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>Fifth, Commission staff is working diligently to process applications for exemption relief, requests for no-action letters, and registration statements, but rising volumes may present challenges. </strong></span>Adherence to technical and legal requirements, sound legal analysis, and thorough and timely responses to staff questions help conserve Commission resources and achieve clearer regulatory goals more quickly and smoothly. As always, such diligence will help applications move more smoothly through the approval process; conversely, a lack of such diligence may result in unnecessary delays. First in does not mean first out. </p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>Sixth, a renewed commitment to a better regulatory environment should not be viewed as an endorsement of any cryptocurrency or token. </strong></span>The Commission does not endorse any product or service, regardless of whether such coin or token is within our jurisdiction; there is no such thing as an SEC stamp of approval. It‚Äôs easy to issue tokens, and if people want to buy a token or product that lacks a clear long-term value proposition, they should be free to do so, but they shouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the price drops one day. In this country, people generally have the right to make their own decisions, but that wonderful American freedom is matched by the equally wonderful American expectation that people must make their own decisions, not expect the government to tell them what to do or not do, or to bail them out if they do something terrible. </p><p>Now, with those rather cursory disclaimers, let‚Äôs talk about the work the Task Force is doing in partnership with staff across the Commission‚Äôs policy divisions. We will be working with the federal government, state securities regulators, and our international counterparts. We invite builders, enthusiasts, and skeptics to join us in exploring what the final rule should be and what interim measures might help foster innovation in the meantime. Commission staff has achieved one milestone‚Äîwithdrawing Staff Accounting Bulletin 121‚Äîbut there is much more work to do. [4] This list is not exhaustive, nor is it presented in order of priority or expected completion. </p><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\"><li><p><strong>Security Status:</strong>The status of crypto-assets under the securities laws is fundamental to addressing many other issues. <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>The Working Group is working to examine different types of crypto-assets. </strong></span></p></li><li><p><strong>Scooping:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>The Working Group will work to help identify some areas that fall outside the Commission‚Äôs jurisdiction. </strong></span>As a first step, the staff welcomes requests for no-action letters. No-action letters typically take the form of a staff statement in which the staff does not recommend an enforcement action to the Commission in response to the specific circumstances articulated in the letter. The statement addresses the specific situation but provides the public at large with a useful window into the staff‚Äôs thinking. </p></li><li><p><strong>Tokens and Token Offerings:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>The Working Group is also considering the possibility of recommending that the Commission take action to provide temporary prospective and retroactive relief for tokens or token offerings where the issuing entity or other entity willing to assume responsibility provides certain specific information, keeps that information current, and agrees not to contest the Commission‚Äôs jurisdiction in the event of a case involving allegations of fraud related to the purchase and sale of assets.</strong></span>These tokens would be deemed non-securities, so there would be no uncertainty as to whether they would be able to trade freely on secondary markets that are not registered with the SEC, as long as information is kept current and accurate. This approach would bridge the gap until more permanent rules or legislation are finalized. It would provide a path for existing tokens to move out of the fog of uncertainty that obscures a viable path forward and encourage greater disclosure. </p></li><li><p><strong>Registered Offerings:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>The Working Group will consider working with staff to recommend that the Commission modify existing registration pathways, including Regulation A and crowdfunding, so that there is a viable path for those interested in registering token offerings.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><strong>Special Purpose Broker-Dealers:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>The Working Group will explore possible updates to the no-action statement for special purpose broker-dealers, which has not been successful in its current form.</strong></span>An initial change we may recommend is to expand the statement to cover broker-dealers that custody crypto-asset securities as well as non-security crypto-assets. We will work with the public to identify additional barriers to registration. </p></li><li><p><strong>Custody Solutions for Investment Advisers:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>We will work with investment advisers to provide an appropriate regulatory framework within which advisers can safely, legally, and reliably custody client assets themselves or with third parties.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><strong>Crypto Lending and Staking:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>We need clarity on whether cryptocurrency lending and staking programs are subject to the securities laws, and if so, how. We plan to work to help address how to bring such programs into compliance with the law.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><strong>Crypto Exchange-Traded Products:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>The Commission has received a proposed rule change from an SRO to list new types of cryptocurrency exchange-traded products. </strong></span>The Working Group will work with staff to provide clear statements on the approach used in approving or denying these applications. The Working Group will also assist staff and the Commission in considering requests to modify certain features of existing exchange-traded products, including allowing for collateralization and physical creation and redemption. However, the Commission may have to make progress on custody and other issues before these changes can be implemented. </p></li><li><p><strong>Clearing Agencies and Transfer Agents:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>The Working Group also plans to examine the intersection of cryptocurrencies with the rules governing clearing agencies and transfer agents.</strong></span>We will continue to work with market participants who are interested in tokenizing securities or otherwise using blockchain technology to modernize traditional financial markets.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cross-border Sandboxes:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>Many cryptocurrency projects are international in nature. </strong></span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>The Working Group is considering how to facilitate cross-border experimentation on a limited scale and temporary timeframe, and potentially on a more permanent, long-term approach. </strong></span></p></li></ol><p>This brief overview of how the Working Group sees the journey ahead is not exhaustive or definitive, but I hope it will be of interest to you. While there are many obstacles to ultimately developing sensible, clear rules, the journey will be exciting and rewarding if we work together. This is the beginning of a conversation‚Äîone we don‚Äôt want to have just with ourselves. </p><p><strong>Citations</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">[1] Press release, ‚ÄúSEC Crypto 2.0: Acting Chairman Uyeda Announces New Crypto Working Group,‚Äù January 21, 2025, https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025-30.
