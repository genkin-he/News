            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Niu Zhanlin; Source: Cailianshe Silicon Valley NEWS</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">On February 3rd, local time, US President Trump signed an executive order instructing government officials to establish a sovereign wealth fund. It is still unclear how the fund will operate and how it will be financed.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">When Trump announced the move at the White House that day, he said that the United States has \"huge potential\" and has appointed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant and Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick to lead the preparation of the sovereign wealth fund.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">During the campaign, Trump proposed to follow the sovereign wealth fund model of Norway, Saudi Arabia and other countries to convert national resources (such as energy income) into long-term investment capital.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Bessant pointed out that the sovereign wealth fund will be established within the next 12 months and called it an issue of \"great strategic significance.\" </strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The text of the executive order signed by Trump has not been made public, and it is unclear where the funds for the fund will come from. Trump has promised to establish \"the world's largest sovereign wealth fund.\"</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Last September, Trump first proposed this idea in a speech at the New York Economic Club, which is to inject tariff revenue into a sovereign wealth fund to invest in manufacturing centers, defense and medical research.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Trump said at the time: <strong>\"We will create America's own sovereign wealth fund and benefit all Americans.\" He then mentioned that Wall Street and business leaders can play a role in helping \"provide investment advice.\"</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Sovereign wealth funds are usually found in countries with large foreign exchange reserves or commodity income, such as Norway and Saudi Arabia, and invest in various fields from stocks and bonds to infrastructure and technology.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The current world's largest sovereign wealth fund is the Norwegian Government Pension Fund (about $1.8 trillion). If Trump wants to surpass it, he needs at least $1 trillion in initial funds. But the United States lacks stable natural resource income like Norway, and it is almost impossible to achieve it in the short term. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In reality, the United States does not have a sovereign wealth fund at the federal level, but 20 states have similar funds, which are funded by energy or land revenue, such as the Alaska Permanent Fund and the North Dakota Heritage Fund. If Trump's proposal is realized, it will be the first attempt by the United States to establish a national sovereign fund. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">It is worth noting that <strong>some people speculate that the sovereign wealth fund is prepared to establish Bitcoin reserves, and some analysts believe that Trump will use these funds to buy Greenland</strong>. </p></div></div>",

The White House said that if the US tariffs are retaliated, the US may increase the tariffs.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In addition, according to Xinhua News Agency, the White House said on the same day that the United States will impose a 10% tariff on all goods imported from the mainland on the basis of existing tariffs. Trump said this is consistent with the \"protectionist measures\" he supports.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Affected by Trump's tariff policy, Japanese and Korean stock markets fell sharply on Monday. The Nikkei 225 Index closed down 1,052.40 points, or 2.66%, at 38,520.09 points on February 3 (Monday); the South Korean KOSPI Index closed down 64.04 points, or 2.54%, at 2,453.33 points on February 3 (Monday). </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">According to Coinglass data, in the past 24 hours, the entire network had a liquidation of $2.119 billion, of which $1.78 billion was liquidated for long orders and $270 million was liquidated for short orders. A total of 718,513 people were liquidated worldwide. The largest single liquidation occurred on Binance-ETHBTC, with a value of $25.635 million. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346655_image3.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>According to Jinshi, Goldman Sachs strategists said that the U.S. stock market is likely to fall 5% in the coming months as the latest round of tariffs from the Trump administration affects earnings forecasts. </strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Goldman Sachs strategist David Kostin wrote in a report: \"These statements shocked many investors, who expected tariffs to be imposed only if trade negotiations failed. Our economists see an uncertain outlook but believe that tariffs on Canada and Mexico are likely to be temporary.\"</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Kostin also said that if it continues, the latest tariffs will reduce his earnings forecasts for S&amp;P 500 companies by about 2% to 3%, and this does not take into account the impact of further tightening of the financial environment or changes in consumer and corporate behavior. He also warned that the fair value of the S&amp;P 500 could fall by about 5% in the short term as both earnings and stock valuations take a hit. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Various Opinions</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Analysts at brokerage firm Bernstein said in a report to clients: \"If tariffs mean a stronger dollar, higher inflation and a weakening outlook for rate cuts in the short term, then this means a decline in global liquidity for risky assets. Over a longer time frame, as governments take on higher debts and higher deficits, leading to further currency depreciation, Bitcoin has relative value relative to the dollar, which is evident in Bitcoin's long-term compounding history. But in the short term, Bitcoin is correlated with risky assets. Therefore, the sell-off in cryptocurrencies is not surprising.\"</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7330920_image3.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Bernstein analysts believe that in the long run, the Trump administration believes that cryptocurrencies are of strategic significance to government governance and national finances, and are aimed at controlling inflation by cutting deficits, cost-cutting departments of the Government Efficiency Department led by Elon Musk, and increasing energy production. Although foreign governments may retaliate against tariffs by selling U.S. Treasuries.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But Bernstein expects sovereigns to hoard gold and Bitcoin as economic buffers, the United States will lead the shift to support cryptocurrencies, and more countries may follow suit.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>However, Jeff Park, head of strategy at Bitwise Alpha, said that tariffs may only be a temporary tool, but the long-term conclusion is that Bitcoin will not only go higher, but also faster, because both sides of the trade imbalance equation want Bitcoin, so the final result is the same: higher prices and faster speeds.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Petr Kozyakov, CEO of crypto payment platform Mercuryo, pointed out that after Trump announced the tariffs on Friday, a wave of FUD was set off in the cryptocurrency market, and the prospect of long-term interest rate hikes shook all markets around the world. Although Bitcoin has fallen below the $100,000 mark, the king of cryptocurrencies has once again proved itself to be unique, in stark contrast to altcoins that have fallen across the board. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346656_image3.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Aave founder Stani Kulechov said: \"Tariffs will raise funds and increase domestic production for the United States, and will also allow other countries to raise funds and increase their domestic production, so that every country will participate in the competition for domestic production. This is not a recession, but a reorganization of the entire global economy. For those who see the uncertainty of the stock market crash during the transition, cryptocurrencies will serve as a hedge, and for those who want to reduce the uncertainty of the bond market crash, DeFi income will also serve as a hedge.\"</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Looking forward</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Looking forward, the global economy will continue to adjust and reorganize under the influence of tariff policies and cryptocurrencies. As governments seek a balance between trade protectionism and digital asset strategies, market uncertainty and volatility may increase. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">However, this also provides new opportunities for cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance (DeFi) as a tool to hedge risks in traditional financial markets. In the future, we may see more countries adopt Bitcoin and other crypto assets as economic buffers, driving the global financial system towards a more diversified and innovative direction. </p><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"></ol></div></div>",

The White House said the order instructs the Treasury and Commerce Departments to begin reviewing the process of establishing a sovereign wealth fund. \"We will start this matter within the next 12 months. We will realize the assets on the US balance sheet for the American people,\" said US Treasury Secretary Bessant. He mentioned that they plan to study the \"best practices\" of other funds and that the fund will hold a range of liquid assets and other US assets. Trump mentioned this idea several times during his campaign. He called for a fund to \"invest in great national causes for the benefit of all American people,\" such as infrastructure construction and medical research. It is not clear where the funds for the US sovereign wealth fund will come from. Most sovereign wealth funds are made up of surplus income generated by natural resources, such as oil-rich Saudi Arabia. However, the United States faces major budget and trade deficits. At the same time, the United States also has strong private markets, which allows investors to support the various initiatives that Trump mentioned the new fund hopes to invest in.

style=\"text-align: left;\">3.1 RWA's compliance framework - Disputes over securities attributes: - If a token represents a right to income, it may be considered a security (such as the Howey test of the US SEC). - Compliance path: Compliance through Reg D/S exemption or STO (Securities Token Offering). - Cross-border regulatory conflicts: - Conflicts between the laws of the location of the asset, the place of issuance and the jurisdiction of the investor.  </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">-    Case   : The EU MiCA Act requires RWA issuers to operate with a license.  </p><p

style=\"text-align: left;\">- If points can be freely traded or exchanged for legal currency, they may be regarded as \"virtual currency\" and subject to regulation (such as the ban on virtual currency by the People's Bank of China).  </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">-   Consumer protection: </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">- The validity period and redemption rules of points must be clearly defined to avoid fraud (such as the EU Consumer Rights Directive).  </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">-   Tax treatment: </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">- Whether the issuance of points is

style=\"text-align: left;\">-   Tokenization of points: </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Convert centralized points into on-chain assets (such as NFT) and allow cross-platform circulation.  </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">   Challenges: Compliance and value anchoring issues need to be resolved.  </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">-   RWA+points hybrid incentives: </p><p style=\"text-align:

style=\"text-align: left;\">Chapter 6: Future Trends and Challenges  </h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">6.1 The Future of RWA  </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">- Trends: </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">- Integration with traditional finance (such as BlackRock's BUIDL fund investing in treasury bond tokenization).  </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">- Expansion of emerging asset classes (intellectual property, climate derivatives).  </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">- Challenges:  </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">- Regulatory fragmentation hinders global liquidity.  </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">- Off-chain asset rights confirmation relies on centralized institutions (such as property registration offices).  </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">6.2 The future of the points system  </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">- Trends:  </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">- Points tokenization: cross-platform interoperability through blockchain (such as the merger of airline and hotel points).  </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">- Dynamic pricing: AI algorithms adjust the value of points in real time (such as floating exchange ratios based on supply and demand).  </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">-  Challenges: </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">- Excessive financialization triggers regulatory scrutiny (e.g. the secondary market for points is banned).  </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">- User privacy and data abuse risks.  </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">6.3 Ultimate Fusion: Synergy between RWA and Points  </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">- Possibilities: </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">- Points serve as the \"governance credentials\" of the RWA ecosystem. For example, holding points can participate in asset voting.  </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">- RWA income is distributed in the form of points to enhance user stickiness (e.g. real estate token dividends are converted into platform points).  </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">-  Barriers: </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">- Conflict of legal attributes (points must avoid being characterized as securities).  </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">- Differences in technical architecture (RWA requires high security, points require high concurrency).   </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Conclusion</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">RWA and the points system represent two paradigms of the digital economy:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">- RWA is an asset upgrade from \"physical to virtual\", and its core is to break the liquidity barrier;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">- Points are a user operation tool from \"behavior to value\", and their core is to build a closed economic cycle.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the future, the boundaries between the two may become blurred - points can be supported by real assets through tokenization, while RWA can expand the user base through the points system. However, this process requires resolving the fundamental conflicts between compliance, technology and economic models. Only by finding a balance can the true potential of \"virtual-real integration\" be released. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Partly with the help of artificial intelligence. </p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p>Author: Lawyer Liu Zhengyao</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span leaf=\"\">Introduction</span></strong></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">In criminal cases involving virtual currencies, most cases require judicial authorities to determine the amount involved. However, according to the current domestic regulatory policy on virtual currencies, no institution may engage in pricing services for virtual currency transactions. Although judicial authorities now entrust third-party companies to dispose of the virtual currencies involved in the case, most of the disposal is carried out after the court's judgment.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">According to Lawyer Liu's practical experience, in the criminal case procedure, it is difficult to determine the value of the virtual currency involved at the beginning. So when the virtual currency involved appreciates or depreciates during the entire criminal procedure, how should the court determine the amount involved in the end? </span></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346617_image3.png\" type=\"block\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">Lawyer Liu discussed this topic from three aspects: the high volatility of the value of virtual currency, the importance of determining the amount involved in criminal cases, and how to determine the amount involved in criminal cases involving virtual currency. </span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">一 </span></span></strong><strong><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">High market volatility of virtual currency</span></span></strong></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">At the moment when Lawyer Liu was typing, the price of Bitcoin had fallen to $93,000. Although analyzing the price trend of Bitcoin is essentially a financial analysis, and as a legal worker, Lawyer Liu's financial knowledge is too superficial; but from a metaphysical point of view, the following judgment seems to be convincing: During the Chinese Spring Festival, the price of the currency does not seem to have been much higher. </span></span></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346619_image3.png\" type=\"block\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">(The cryptocurrency world on the sixth day of the Lunar New Year seemed to be all red. Although it reflected a certain traditional festive color, it was simply a tragedy for friends in the cryptocurrency world)</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">High price volatility is a basic feature of mainstream currencies and even more so non-mainstream currencies (except for stablecoins USDT, USDC, etc.), but friends with a little \"legal sense\" know that the most basic feature of the law is stability, and they hate \"ADHD\". The high volatility of virtual currency prices will inevitably bring considerable trouble to the implementation of the law. For example, when the public security organs file a criminal case, the seized virtual currency may be worth only 1 million yuan, but by the time the court makes a judgment, the price of these virtual currencies has climbed to 10 million yuan; or when the criminal case is filed, the market value of the seized virtual currency is 10 million yuan, and the value of these coins has returned to zero when the court makes a judgment (this is a common situation in the currency circle). </span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">If it is the first case above, except for the suspect/defendant, his defense lawyer and family members who are unhappy, everyone else will be happy - for the victim, the refund is guaranteed, and for the public security, procuratorate and court, the motivation to handle the case is more sufficient; but the latter situation will be the opposite: the suspect/defendant, his defense lawyer and family members will be happy, and everyone else will be very uncomfortable, because for virtual currency with a value of zero, it may mean that it no longer constitutes a criminal case. </span></span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Two </span></span><strong><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Why is it important to determine the amount involved?</span></span></strong></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Currently, cases involving virtual currency are mostly concentrated in the fields of economic crimes and crimes that disrupt social management order (such as aiding and abetting crimes). A very important factor in the constituent elements of these crimes is the amount involved. For example, under normal circumstances, if the amount involved is less than 3,000 yuan, it does not constitute a crime of fraud; in pyramid schemes, if the amount involved is less than 2.5 million yuan, a prison sentence of more than five years cannot be imposed (here, Lawyer Liu uses the control variable method in science and engineering experiments and does not consider other circumstances). </span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">In addition, for criminal cases, not only the criminal case filing stage of the public security should be considered, but there are also two subsequent processes of the procuratorate and the court. An unpredictable amount of money involved will make prosecutors and judges who pursue high-quality case handling uneasy, just like Schrödinger's cat. </span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Therefore, a clear amount of money involved is crucial for the filing, prosecution, trial, and even the subsequent execution of criminal cases. </span></span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Three </span></span><strong><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">What to do after the virtual currency involved appreciates or depreciates? </span></span></strong></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Through the above analysis, we know that in judicial practice, one thing that must be done is to clarify the amount involved in virtual currency criminal cases. How to do it specifically? </span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Currently, there are generally the following ways to determine the amount involved in criminal cases: </span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">One ​​is to be determined by the Price Determination Center. </span><span text=\"\">According to the National Development and Reform Commission's \"Code of Conduct for Price Determination\", price determination in criminal cases can be carried out by price determination institutions (i.e. local price determination centers). Specific methods include: market method, cost method, income method, expert consultation method, etc.; however, according to the \"9.24 Notice\" (\"Notice on Further Preventing and Dealing with the Risks of Speculation in Virtual Currency Transactions\"), my country currently does not allow any institution to provide pricing services for virtual currency transactions. Therefore, there is a lot of controversy as to whether the price determination center can determine the price of the virtual currency involved. Lawyer Liu believes that the price determination center is not suitable to participate in the price determination of the virtual currency involved; </span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Second, refer to the market transaction price. </span><span text=\"\">At present, some judicial organs will refer to the virtual currency transaction prices of mainstream virtual currency exchanges (with USDT as the pricing benchmark) to determine the prices of the virtual currencies involved, such as the theft case of Li in the criminal judgment of (2020) Yue 0304 Xingchu No. 2 of the Shenzhen Futian District Court. However, this approach has a flaw: my country currently does not allow virtual currency exchanges to provide services to mainland Chinese residents. So can judicial organs use the pricing services of foreign virtual currency exchanges as an exception? Lawyer Liu believes that of course it is not possible;</span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Third, the price determination is based on the price appraisal opinions of third-party institutions and the price determination in the judicial appraisal opinions.</span><span text=\"\">Although third-party appraisal institutions are different from price determination centers with \"official backgrounds\", they are still essentially provided by domestic third-party institutions for virtual currency pricing services, which is essentially no different from the pricing services of price determination centers in the first model, and it is difficult to circumvent the prohibitive provisions of the \"9.24 Notice\". In particular, the judicial appraisal agency's determination of the price of the virtual currency involved in the case has exceeded the scope of judicial appraisal. The judicial appraisal agency has no power and qualifications to determine the price of the virtual currency involved in the case;</span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Fourth, it is determined by the suspect/defendant's sales amount or the victim's loss amount.</span><span text=\"\">Because my country does not prohibit virtual currency investment and trading, whether it is a criminal case that requires the return of property (such as fraud and theft) or a criminal case that requires the confiscation of property involved (such as organizing and leading pyramid selling activities, opening a casino, and illegal business operations), if the suspect/defendant has sold the virtual currency involved for cash or has exchanged it for other property, then the cash amount or the value of the exchanged property can be used as the amount involved; if it is difficult to calculate the suspect/defendant's sales amount, but the victim's loss amount can be clearly determined, the victim's loss amount should be used as the basis for determining the amount involved. This is because in determining the amount involved in a criminal case, there is a basic principle, which is the \"victim does not profit\" principle (while taking into account the \"doubt favors the suspect\" principle). If the virtual currency purchased by the victim for 10,000 yuan is stolen, and the virtual currency has appreciated to 100,000 yuan when the court makes a judgment, then the court should use 10,000 yuan as the amount involved; if the victim's loss amount (purchase amount) cannot be ascertained, the market value of the virtual currency at the time of judgment can be considered as the amount involved. </span></span></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346621_image3.png\" type=\"block\"/></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Fourth </span></span><strong><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Written at the end</span></span></strong></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">The price fluctuations of virtual currencies are large, which means that in criminal cases, all parties involved in the litigation must pay attention to the value of the virtual currencies involved. Even for stablecoins such as USDT and USDC, it cannot be taken for granted that their value can always be constant and equivalent to the US dollar. After all, no one can guarantee that Tether or other centralized institutions will not go bankrupt. Therefore, it is necessary to promptly, accurately, legally and compliantly determine the value of the virtual currency involved in the case, and properly handle the appreciation or depreciation of the virtual currency involved during the period of detention in the criminal case. </span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">In current judicial practice, there are mature plans for legally and compliantly disposing of the virtual currency involved in the case, which is crucial to protecting the legitimate rights and interests of victims, suspects/defendants in criminal cases. （END）</span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">&lt;span rootId\":\"Qn07d0nroo4uoGxJ7LTcE8l6naf\",\"text\":{\"initialAttributedTexts\":{\"text\":{\"0\":\"Based on the above content, the disposal of the virtual currency involved in the case, if in accordance with criminal procedures, is best handled after the judgment; however, for some cases where the conviction and sentencing can only be based on the amount of virtual currency involved in the case, the investment can be made before the judgment; if it is handled by the judicial organ, the current judicial practice is that the public security organs handle it. Of course, it is not ruled out that in the future, when the business capabilities of the procuratorate, especially the court, continue to improve and there are no technical obstacles to the custody and disposal of virtual currency, the court will be directly responsible for the disposal of the virtual currency involved. </p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align:center\"></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: W3C DAO</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>According to Bitcoin Magazine's post on the X platform, citing information from Eric Weiss, a board member of Core Scientific, a US-listed company, 15 states, including Alabama, Arizona, and Florida, have launched plans for strategic Bitcoin reserves. Arizona and Utah have already reached the stage of approval by both houses, and are only one step away from being approved into law.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346599_image3.png\"/></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Bitcoin Reserves</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Previously, Tim Scott, chairman of the US Senate Banking Committee, appointed Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis as chair of the committee's newly established Digital Assets Committee. Lummis then issued a statement announcing that the new committee dedicated to digital assets will focus on two areas:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Adopt bipartisan digital asset legislation to promote responsible innovation and protect consumers, including legislation on market structure, stablecoins, and strategic bitcoin reserves;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Strong oversight of federal financial regulators to ensure that these institutions comply with the law, including ensuring that Operation Chokepoint 2.0 does not occur again.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Operation Chokepoint 2.0 is allegedly a collaborative action taken by U.S. federal government agencies to remove cryptocurrency companies from the traditional banking system, and no official documents have yet confirmed its existence.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346600_image3.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Last July, Trump promised to list Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset for the United States at the Bitcoin 2024 conference. Later, Lummis mentioned the legislation for the strategic reserve of Bitcoin again. She said: \"Digital assets represent the future. If the United States hopes to continue to maintain its leading position in global financial innovation, Congress needs to urgently pass bipartisan legislation to establish a comprehensive legal framework for digital assets and strengthen the dollar through strategic Bitcoin reserves. ... I look forward to submitting bipartisan legislation to President Trump to ensure our financial future.\" The news of Lummis's appointment quickly detonated the cryptocurrency market. At that time, the intraday trading price of Bitcoin (BTC) against the US dollar once rose and turned up. </strong></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Rapid progress</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The \"Bitcoin Strategic Reserve\" issue was actually proposed and discussed before the US presidential election. Senator Cynthia Lummis proposed the \"US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act\" (BITCOIN Act of 2024) as early as July 31, 2024. The bill proposed to purchase 200,000 bitcoins each year, reaching 1 million within five years.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Later, during the campaign, Trump promised to become the \"cryptocurrency president\" in a speech at the Bitcoin Conference of the crypto industry. The industry hopes that he will fulfill his promise to create a Bitcoin inventory through executive orders, ensure that the industry can obtain banking services, and create a cryptocurrency committee. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">On December 17, 2024, the Bitcoin Policy Institute (BPI) (note that it is not an official organization, but a non-profit organization focusing on Bitcoin policy research, but it is still one of the important think tanks for decision makers on Bitcoin-related issues) released a draft executive order, trying to provide reference opinions for Trump's \"Bitcoin Strategic Reserve\" executive order framework. This draft clearly proposes: It is recommended that 1%-5% of Treasury assets be used to purchase Bitcoin to form a long-term reserve. Led by the Ministry of Finance and coordinated by the Federal Reserve, the reserve will be gradually established. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346602_image3.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">On December 19, 2024, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell (who is expected to continue to perform his duties after Trump takes office) expressed cautious views at a press conference. Powell said that the Federal Reserve has no intention of participating in any government plan to hoard Bitcoin. Such issues fall within the scope of Congress’s responsibilities, and the Federal Reserve has not sought to change existing laws to allow the holding of Bitcoin. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>From the latest situation, although the Federal Reserve Chairman holds a conservative opinion, under favorable conditions such as Trump’s nomination of a crypto-friendly US Treasury Secretary and the “Presidential Executive Order” issued quickly after taking office, these will not affect the Trump team’s plan to continue to promote the inclusion of Bitcoin in the US strategic reserve. </strong></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Written in the end</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Looking to the future, the concept of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset is gradually gaining more attention and support. As more states and countries begin to consider including Bitcoin in their reserve assets, the global financial system may undergo a profound transformation. Bitcoin's decentralized nature and limited supply make it a unique means of storing value, attracting the interest of governments and financial institutions. In the United States, with the advancement of the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act and the gradual implementation of relevant legislation, Bitcoin is expected to become part of the national strategic reserve. This will not only enhance Bitcoin's position in the global financial market, but also set an important example for other countries. In the future, we may see more countries follow the United States' practice and include Bitcoin in their national reserves, thereby promoting the further development of the global cryptocurrency market. In addition, with the improvement of digital asset legislation and the establishment of a regulatory framework, the cryptocurrency market will become more transparent and stable. This will help attract more investors to the market and promote innovation and technological progress. As an emerging financial instrument, Bitcoin's potential and influence will continue to expand and become an indispensable part of the global financial system. In short, the advancement of Bitcoin strategic reserves is not only a recognition of the cryptocurrency market, but also a positive exploration of future financial innovation. We look forward to the widespread application and development of Bitcoin around the world, which will bring more opportunities and challenges to the global economy.</p><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"></ol></div></div>",
