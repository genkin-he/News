The daily person in charge of this product is Trump's second son Eric:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346662_image3.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This Eric also played a trick. After sending a tweet last night that he was optimistic about Ethereum in the long term, he liquidated Ethereum:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346663_image3.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So is Eric admitting his loss? </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Since the establishment of the \"Presidential Strict Selection\" position, some people have calculated that the floating loss has exceeded 15%. In fact, WLFI has never lost money. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Because these \"strict selections\" are essentially advertising fees. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Because as long as a big investor buys $10 million of $WLFI, then he can buy a token designated by the project party. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And the current agreement of $WLFI cannot be traded, only voting rights, which are not transferable. It can be considered as the Pixiu plate opened by Trump's family. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346664_image3.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As for the purchase amount, the maximum is 40% of the purchase amount of $WLFI. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Therefore, the essence of the Ethereum community's crazy increase in Ethereum positions due to \"Presidential Strict Selection\" some time ago is that Ethereum dealers bought more $WLFI:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346665_image3.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">After this wave of clearing Ethereum, the largest position of \"Presidential Strict Selection\" became Sun Yuchen's TRX. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And before that, Justin Sun had announced that he had purchased $75 million of WLFI in two installments:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346666_image3.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">These two purchases are likely to have one designated TRX and one designated ETH. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">After all, Justin Sun also holds a large amount of Ethereum and needs to ship it. Similar to Eric's operation this time, Sun Ge has already operated it once two months ago~</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346667_image3.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So friends in the crypto circle should gradually cultivate their own cognition, and don't trust the big V to bring goods!</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Finally, a warm reminder that other tokens such as aave/link are all on the upper-level relationship route. There are many official announcements of cooperation, but basically no one uses the products that have landed.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">That's all, everyone should learn from it~</p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p>Author: Xiao Lizi; Source: Blockchain Blue Ocean</p><p line=\"init\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The market has been falling since last weekend, and it started to accelerate in the early morning of Monday. This morning, there was a huge drop, and the leverage of more than 5 times the copycat long positions was almost all liquidated.</p><p line=\"hruO\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">I myself did not escape this wave of decline. Although I reduced some positions in the past few days, it was also a large spot position that was hit. I can only say that it is better than various leverage explosions. I am still alive.</p><p line=\"9Mzk\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Everyone is concerned about one thing, is the bull market over now?</strong></p><p line=\"B7oc\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Now the market is full of panic, and there are reasons for both shorting and bearishness. Those who are optimistic about the future market believe that the leverage has been completely blown up and the car is light, and it can rise happily in the future. Those who are pessimistic believe that except for BTC, which is still in a bull market, other altcoins including Ethereum have long been in a bear market, and a large number of altcoins have continuously hit new lows. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The fuse of today's plunge</strong></h2><p line=\"6b3c\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">First of all, we need to analyze the reasons for this big drop in a simple and easy-to-understand way: <strong>The main reason for this big drop is not in the currency circle itself but outside. </strong></p><p line=\"SyeT\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">1. The issue of tariffs. This issue is difficult to explain clearly in a short space, and I cannot guarantee that I understand the joints very thoroughly. But roughly speaking, the market expected that Trump would wield the \"tariff stick\" when he came to power, mainly using this attitude to force other countries to give in on some issues, that is, tariffs are just a weapon to scare people. </p><p line=\"9Vbu\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">As a result, it was discovered over the weekend that Trump was ready to play for real, and even used IEEPA (a special power that the president can use in an emergency economic state to initiate economic sanctions or modify tariffs without restrictions from Congress), which had a huge impact on the market. <strong>Plus it was the weekend, the U.S. stock market could not price this matter, and the cryptocurrency circle had no reference to the U.S. stock market, so it panicked alone. </strong></p><p line=\"FBiM\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">2. Deepseek also had a huge impact on U.S. stock AI, especially the leader Nvidia. Why can Nvidia surpass Apple? Because the market is optimistic about the big narrative of AI, and AI requires a lot of computing power, and Nvidia's chips are in short supply. And Deepseek's ultra-low cost (I don't know if it's true or not) made investors begin to doubt whether so much computing power (chips) is needed, and whether it is necessary for other technology companies to invest huge amounts of money in the field of AI? </p><p line=\"vtLT\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The US stock market has long been riddled with holes, most companies' stock prices are sluggish (similar to altcoins), and the number of corporate bankruptcies has hit a new high since 2008. The stock index is supported by the stock prices of technology giants. If a few giants fall, how can the US stock market not fall? <strong>As long as the Deepseek incident has not been falsified, it is a sword hanging over the US stock market. </strong></p><p line=\"tuEq\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">3. Regarding the issue of interest rate cuts, the Federal Reserve announced a few days ago that it would not cut interest rates. Many people began to be pessimistic and believed that it would not be cut once in 25 years or even at all, which also had a certain impact on market expectations. I think this matter has an impact but not much. The previous article in December has already judged that there is a high probability that there will be no interest rate cut this time, and it will wait and see. Moreover, the newly replaced FOMC voting committee is relatively dovish, and the King of Understanding will also put pressure on Powell to cut interest rates. Japan's previous announcement of an interest rate hike also had an impact, but this was secondary to the decline.</p><p line=\"90nT\" style=\"text-align: left;\">In general, this decline was caused by the superposition of multiple factors, especially the sudden impact of tariffs and deepseek.</p><p line=\"ql3p\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Looking at the specific market performance, BTC's rise has set a new high. From the new high on January 20 to today's correction, it is only 16 points. The plunge from Sunday to Monday is actually only 11 points. This correction range is a very normal \"bull market flash crash\" no matter how you look at it. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The bull market of altcoins may have ended</strong></h2><p line=\"owiY\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The key is that altcoins, including Ethereum, have been hit hard. Ethereum has fallen from its recent high of around 3400 on the 1st to 2100, a 38% drop in 2 days. SOL has also adjusted back 40% from its recent record high. This is still a relatively large currency. Many altcoins listed on BN have continued to hit new lows, and have even fallen below the lows before the launch in the second half of last year. Yesterday, there were many altcoins that fell 60%. </p><p line=\"Rvmo\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">I placed an order for altcoins in advance last night according to BTC, which was about five or six points, and the altcoin fell twice as much as BTC. As a result, I bought it and suffered a 20% drop. </p><p line=\"oytD\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">If I believed before that after BTC stabilized at 100,000, the altcoins would catch up and start the altcoin season (some tracks and some projects rose sharply, and other projects generally rose slightly, rather than the overall rise like the bull market in 2021). Now looking at the market again, I think the bull market of altcoins has ended, or it ended as early as the beginning of 2024, but we were confused by the rise of BTC last year. </p><p line=\"ogyc\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">I think the main reason for this phenomenon is that we usually think that the Wall Street institutions will enter the market and pull BTC to the sky, and then the overflow funds and the newly entered retail funds will buy cheaper altcoins, forming the rising order of the previous bull market. But in fact, because the number of Shanzhai projects has increased significantly in this round of bull market, most of them are \"VC coins\" with high FDV and low circulation. The market liquidity has been drained, and these projects have a very poor wealth-creating effect in the secondary market. </p><p line=\"DnPW\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">For Shanzhai, listing on platforms like BN has become a channel for project parties and VCs to exit. Project parties sell when they go online, institutions sell when they unlock, and users sell when they receive airdrops. Retail investors in the secondary market have been direct, but found that the depth is bottomless and became the payers of the feast. <strong>When the market began to punish those diamond hands who held coins, and when retail investors also began to stop accepting these coins and began to turn to relatively fairer memes, the market began to self-FUD as a whole. </strong></p><p line=\"PfeF\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The current market perception is that you should not have any faith in Shanzhai, either sell it, or sell it for BTC if you are afraid of missing out. This has caused the exchange rates of almost all currencies against BTC to continue to fall. Even if some currencies are strong in the short term, they will continue to fall in the long run. </p><p line=\"xCo3\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>To reverse this situation of the market's continuous self-FUD of the cottage, there is only one possibility, that is, a large-scale, large-scale, and sustained general rise in the cottage, and the reappearance of the cottage's wealth-making effect</strong>, rather than pulling up like TRUMP and directly sucking the blood of the whole market. I think the current market environment is impossible to achieve, unless the Federal Reserve releases a huge amount of money like in 20 years, and the water is so much that it overflows. </p><p line=\"6Q1z\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">But in the current macro environment, it is difficult to see such a large-scale release of money again, especially since the current global economy is really much worse than expected, otherwise there would not be so many conflicts and civil unrest. </p><p line=\"clSf\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">What I have said may not be correct, but this is my personal understanding of the current plight of Shanzhai, and the reason why I think the plight of Shanzhai will be difficult to reverse for a long time to come. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Future operation suggestions and short-term judgment</strong></h2><p line=\"Up3x\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">My view on the future operation of Shanzhai is: <strong>At this stage</strong><strong>No longer make long-term layout, only participate in the band, no longer hold for a long time; participate in projects with high market attention, and give up unpopular projects; Shanzhai spot should also stop loss and leave, and give up the fantasy of getting back the trapped position for a long time. </strong></p><p line=\"q4L4\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">As for BTC, I think that if there is no serious economic or financial crisis in the United States, the next situation may be a long bull and slow bull, and there may be periodic adjustments in the middle, the amplitude will be larger than that of the US stock market, but it will not fall by 70-80% like before. </p><p line=\"KL7G\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">It is said in the article that I also paid for my own mistakes in this wave, and the market is always right. In the future, we must insist on realizing the profits of the cottage in time, part of which is allocated to BTC and part of it is allocated to cash, and we should not worry about the short-term cottage selling and missing out. </p><p line=\"jBEW\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the short-term. I subjectively think that the decline today is almost the same. According to historical experience, after such a sharp plunge, it is usually a short-term bottom. <strong>The next step should be to make a disordered oscillation and then choose a direction. After the oscillation, it will slowly fall down for two or even three times to confirm the bottom. Those who did not buy the bottom in the morning do not need to worry, there will be opportunities. </strong></p><p line=\"eVj4\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">For example, whether the bottom has been built this time, because the mines that caused this decline have not been cleared, it depends on the trend of the US stock market in the next few days. If the risks of tariffs and US stocks are lifted, then it may fluctuate upward. If the problem intensifies, it may continue to plummet like 313 after the 312 plunge, which is not impossible. </p><p line=\"q3RM\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Don't guess the bottom, especially the decline caused by the emotional catharsis of the event, and what kind of moths will the president who does not play by the rules like Trump do? This is not something that can be predicted by indicator technology or market analysis. <strong>Follow the market, don't be obsessed with your own predictions, we are here to make money, not to prove that our guesses are right.</strong></p><p line=\"rvIQ\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">In the chaotic period after the current plunge, the black swan may come. All we can do is to do a good job of risk control, reduce positions and keep some bullets, stay away from high leverage, and even if we must use leverage, we must set a stop loss.</p><p line=\"TTGw\" ql-global-para=\"true\" style=\"text-align: left;\">If you are alive in the market, you still have a chance, but if you blow up your position, you will really have nothing</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong></strong></p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Liu Jiaolian</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This year's Spring Festival did not repeat the bullish market of the 2021 Spring Festival \"breaking 5 on the fifth day\" (Note: breaking 5 means breaking the historical high of 50,000 US dollars). Instead, it fell three times in a row on the fourth, fifth and sixth days of the first lunar month, from 105k all the way to the lowest level close to 90k, with the maximum drop of nearly 15%.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This unexpectedly broke the defense of many people who were looking forward to the so-called Spring Festival market. For example, in the 1.24 Teaching Chain Internal Reference <strong>\"The Spring Festival is Coming\"</strong>, a research institute proposed that \"<em>BTC has achieved positive returns during the Spring Festival in 11 of the past 12 years, and the statistically impressive 83% hit rate proves the gains during this period.</em>\"</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Then, as expected and unexpected, this year's Spring Festival obviously fell into the other 17%.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The 2.2 Teaching Chain Internal Reference <strong>\"The 4th Week of 2025\" written by Teaching Chain on the road yesterday, which is <strong>\"The Fed Waits and Sees Changes This Cycle is Familiar\"</strong>, has summarized the macroeconomic situation at the beginning of the Spring Festival in the past week. In fact, seeing that the Federal Reserve is not hesitating to take a confrontational stance with the White House to express its toughness, you should have a vague foreboding and don't have too much expectation for \"continue to play music and continue to dance\". </strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In fact, if you look at the market, BTC's current pin test of 90,000 dollars was penetrated twice on December 6, 2024 last year and January 13, 2025 this year. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This position is the lower support of a new high level after the violent pull since late November 2024. 90k-110k constitutes a new level of sideways fluctuations. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">New heights, new levels, and new normals are significantly higher than the 2021 bull top and the 60,000-70,000 dollars after March 2024. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The shorts have inserted pins three times, either the three times are not enough, and the bulls are killed, opening a new market; or they defeat the bulls, kill this new level, and kill back to the old battle line of 70,000 dollars. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">However, BTC has not fallen down the steps, but just stumbled, and it has brought the market to a half-death. The copycat dogs fell to the street one after another, and died in large numbers. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Some of Jiaolian‚Äôs copycat positions that had just turned losses into profits have fallen back into the mud again. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Just hold on, what else can you do? </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Do you cut your positions and exchange for BTC at this time? It must be too late. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Don‚Äôt think about repairing the roof when the house is leaking during a storm. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">What did you do when the sun was shining? </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">When Jiaolian was on the road, he thought of a question, that is, people often say that failure is the mother of success, but why is failure the mother of success? </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">From an empirical point of view, scientific research shows that in terms of entrepreneurial success rate, people who have succeeded before are obviously more likely to succeed again. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the secondary market, you will also see many people gambling year after year and day after day, either speculating in contracts or speculating in memes, but they just go from one failure to another. Even if they occasionally make a small profit, they will soon lose it all again. The final outcome is basically that they lose all their underwear completely and can never turn over again. They are forced to quit and disappear from this market completely. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Jiaolian suddenly seems to have figured it out. The key to success from failure lies in oneself. It lies in whether one can learn lessons from failure, reflect and introspect, not beat one's chest and stamp one's feet, not be annoyed and regretful, but calmly transform failure into correction and improvement of one's existing wrong cognition, and have more courage and strength to put the corrected and improved cognition into continued practice for testing. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So there is a good saying: If you fail in your actions, look for the reasons in yourself. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">From a psychological point of view, it is difficult for people to listen to the advice of others. From a practical point of view, you should not trust anyone. Many times, you must have a strong opinion and the courage to go forward even if there are thousands of people against you in order to achieve great things. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But this will bring a problem, that is, it is impossible to make cognitive corrections and improve the closed loop. The end of being self-satisfied and self-centered is failure. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The closed loop can only be learned through practice, learning from practice, and learning from failure. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As the proverb goes, you will not turn back until you hit the south wall. In fact, people who know to turn around or take a detour after hitting the south wall only once may already be a dragon among men. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So the saying goes, people can never teach people; things can teach people, and they will learn it once they are taught.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In fact, Jiaolian says that things can never teach people, and most people can never learn. Only when you turn yourself into a person who actively learns, can you learn it once, and turn every failure into a stepping stone to your success.</p></div></div>",
