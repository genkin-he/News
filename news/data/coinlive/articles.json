            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p>Source: Barron's Chinese</p><p>In the face of Trump's erratic tariffs, investors should avoid \"stress reactions\" and remain patient to ride out market fluctuations.</p><p>China quickly launched countermeasures in response to U.S. President Trump's decision to impose a 10% tariff on China.</p><p>After the U.S. tariffs on China took effect, China announced a 10% tariff on crude oil, some machinery and automobiles imported from the United States, and a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas products, which will take effect on February 10.</p><p>Last weekend, the United States announced tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada on issues such as illegal immigration and fentanyl. On Monday (February 3), Trump postponed plans to impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada for at least a month after the two countries agreed to ensure border security. The question now is whether the United States and China can reach a similar agreement to prevent the trade war from escalating further.</p><p>Trump is expected to hold a telephone conversation with Chinese leaders. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier on Tuesday that the call would take place \"soon.\"</p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346896_image3.png\"/></p><p>Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economic research at Capital Economics, believes that China's tariffs on the United States may be delayed or canceled before they take effect on February 10. He said: \"To a large extent, China's move is a warning to the United States that China will retaliate if necessary, while also leaving room for concessions.\"</p><p>Evans-Pritchard also pointed out that China's countermeasures only target about $20 billion worth of US goods, compared with Trump's $450 billion worth of Chinese goods. In addition, China has not increased tariffs on strategic goods such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. </p><p>China also said it would launch an antitrust investigation into Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, a move not directly related to Trump's tariffs.</p><p>China has added two U.S. companies to its \"unreliable entity list\": Calvin Klein parent PVH (PVH) and biotech company Illumina (ILMN).</p><p>\"The two entities violated normal market trading principles, interrupted normal transactions with Chinese companies, took discriminatory measures against Chinese companies, and seriously damaged the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies,\" Xinhua News Agency reported, citing a statement from China's Ministry of Commerce.</p><p>China's Ministry of Commerce said the list only targets a very small number of foreign entities that endanger China's national security, and that honest and law-abiding foreign entities have nothing to worry about.</p><p>China also announced export controls on rare metals such as tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium that are critical to making electronics. China is a major miner of these materials.</p><p>Different views on tariffs have emerged within the U.S. government. Economic advisers such as U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have downplayed the issue of tariffs, describing Trump's strategy as \"escalating to de-escalate,\" suggesting that tariffs are a negotiating tool. </p><p>Investors welcomed the delay in U.S. tariffs on Mexico and Canada, but tariffs on China could be trickier. Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy strategist at Stifel, said avoiding tariffs appears to be Trump's real plan. </p><p><strong>The United States imports more from China than it exports, and this will also be the case in 2024</strong></p><p>Black: Exports to China</p><p>Blue: Imports from China</p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346897_image3.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Note: Data for December 2024 has not yet been released, source: U.S. Census Bureau</span></p><p>Wall Street immediately fell when the tariff threat became a reality last Friday. The U.S. stock market recovered some of its losses after the U.S. government announced a delay in imposing tariffs on Mexico and Canada, but ordinary investors want a safer and more predictable place for their money.</p><p>In the short term, the stock market will not be a safe haven, and there are very few places to hide now. Corporate profits may be hit hard, which in turn leads to higher risks in investing in the stock market, depending on how long the trade tensions last. Strategists at Bank of America estimate that overall earnings for the S&amp;P 500 could fall by as much as 8%. </p><p>The view that small-cap companies focused on the US would benefit from Trump's protectionism has also seriously misled investors: the Russell 2000 and S&amp;P 600, two small-cap indexes, have fallen even more than the S&amp;P 500. </p><p>The sharp stock market volatility won't go away anytime soon, as Wall Street is unsure whether tariffs are policy or a negotiating tactic, with the VIX fear index surging nearly 12% to above 18 on Monday. </p><p>\"The uptrend in stocks hasn't changed, but the latest developments in tariffs highlight the potential for interruptions and declines,\" Michael Skordeles, head of U.S. economics at Truist, and Keith Lerner, chief market strategist and co-chief investment officer, wrote in a research note.</p><p>So in this kind of roller-coaster ride, the key is to put money into stocks that can withstand the ups and downs of the broader market, and stocks with rich dividends are a classic example. Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), one of the biggest gainers in the Dow on Monday, has a dividend yield of 2.4%. Stocks that pay handsome dividends, such as UnitedHealth (UNH), Verizon Communications (VZ), Merck (MRK) and IBM (IBM), also rose.</p><p>In an interview with Barron's, Julie Biel, chief market strategist at Kayne Anderson Rudnick, said that investors have learned some lessons from Trump's first term, and dividend stocks are a good way to deal with stock market volatility. </p><p>Mike Morey, chief investment officer of Integrity Viking Funds, is also bullish on dividend stocks, but he doesn’t think investors have to limit themselves to more conservative defensive stocks.</p><p>Broadcom (AVGO) is the top holding of Morey’s Integrity Dividend Harvest Fund, which also holds Corning (GLW) shares, as well as energy and utility stocks such as TC Energy (TRP) and NextEra Energy (NEE), and large banks such as Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).</p><p>“We try to keep volatility low and focus on companies that not only pay dividends but also plan to increase them,” Morey said. “Dividend stocks have been neglected because of the exciting news in artificial intelligence, so there are a lot of attractive opportunities to be found.”</p><p>Investors can also consider traditional safe havens such as U.S. Treasuries and gold. U.S. Treasury yields fell on Monday, a possible sign that investors are flocking to the market amid market turmoil. Gold has been a tried and tested hedge against volatility, recently hitting a record high of $2,850 an ounce.</p><p>The dollar is likely to continue to rise as investors seek safety, according to Thierry Wizman, global foreign exchange and interest rate strategist at Macquarie.</p><p>The dollar \"will attract inflows as a safe haven currency during uncertain times,\" Wizman wrote in a research note. He also believes that \"risk markets will be under pressure if the tariff issue persists, as investors generally believe that tariffs will slow GDP growth, reduce corporate operating profit margins, and lead to higher costs.\"</p><p>However, investors should not \"react\" to the volatility of Trump's tariffs. Negotiations are a page in Trump's \"playbook\" and anything can change in an instant, just as Trump postponed tariffs on Mexico and Canada on Monday. </p><p>Tony Roth, chief investment officer of Wilmington Trust, said: \"It is difficult to know what the final outcome will be. Investors need to remain patient and ride out the market volatility.\"</p><p>Roth believes that for safety reasons, he will not buy consumer staples or non-essential consumer goods stocks. Energy stocks, financial stocks and healthcare stocks can provide effective defense. In the case of increased stock market volatility, these stocks are more likely to present good buying opportunities.</p><p><mp-style-type></mp-style-type></p></div></div>",

In November 2004, the gold ETF received $1.2 billion in inflows in its first month. The inflows of the Bitcoin spot ETF far exceed the first-month inflows of about 6,000 ETFs issued in the past 30 years. </p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346839_image3.png\"/></p><p><strong>Bitcoin's inflation rate drops below gold's long-term supply growth after its 4th halving</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>After the 4th \"halving\" in the history of Bitcoin's supply growth, the annual growth rate dropped from about 1.8% to about 0.9%. Halving is critical to its design, highlighting Bitcoin's predictable monetary policy and its role as a scarce asset. </p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346840_image3.png\"/></p><p><strong>Bitcoin's annual volatility has fallen to a record low, but its risk-adjusted return is still better than most major asset classes</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346841_image3.png\"/></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Despite a sharp drop in miner revenue after halving, Bitcoin's hash rate hits a record high</strong></p><p>Despite a 50% reduction in Bitcoin miner revenue due to halving, its hash rate hits a record high. In other words, miners' long-term confidence in Bitcoin remains strong. </p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346842_image3.png\"/></p><p><strong>Transactions Soar, Thanks to Runes</strong></p><p></p><p>Bitcoin’s daily transaction count hits a record high, thanks to the launch of the Runes protocol. The Runes protocol facilitates the creation of fungible tokens directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346843_image3.png\"/></strong></p><p><strong>Bitcoin Absorbs Significant Selling Pressure in 2024</strong></p><p></p><p>In January 2024, the German government seized 50,000 bitcoins linked to a cyber piracy group. Six months later, it sold those bitcoins. The market successfully absorbed the supply, and then the price of Bitcoin rose from $53,000 to $68,000. In addition, around mid-year, the long-awaited Mt. Gox1 creditor repayment process distributed more than 109,000 bitcoins, eliminating its biggest overhang.</p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346844_image3.png\"/></p><p><strong>More and more public companies hold Bitcoin</strong></p><p></p><p>Currently, 74 public companies hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Over the past year, the value on corporate balance sheets has quintupled, from $11 billion to $55 billion in 2023. </p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346845_image3.png\"/></p><p><strong>Bitcoin’s Total Cost Basis Hits New High in 2024</strong></p><p></p><p>Bitcoin’s realized capitalization, or cost basis, grows 86% in 2024 as its average acquisition cost hits a record high of $40,980 per bitcoin, totaling $811.7 billion.</p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346846_image3.png\"/></p><p><strong>Bitcoin’s transaction velocity and holding behavior highlight its role as a store of value</strong></p><p></p><p>Bitcoin’s transaction velocity falls to a 14-year low in 2024 as supply held for three years or longer reaches an all-time high. </p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346847_image3.png\"/></p><p><strong>Bitcoin is on track to achieve our 2030 price target of $1.5 million/BTC</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346848_image3.png\"/></p><p></p><h2>Second, AI computing is doubling at an accelerated pace and is about to reach the end of the chessboard</h2><p>Mainly due to improvements in AI system architecture, AI computing performance per dollar is expected to increase by more than 1,000 times by 2030. By then, we expect computing performance to double 64 times compared to when integrated circuits were introduced. </p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346849_image3.png\"/></p><p><strong>Advances in AI will unlock huge market opportunities</strong></p><p>As AI continues to accelerate, self-driving taxis will continue to become more common, drug development time and costs will drop significantly, and AI agents will be able to autonomously solve software engineering challenges, monitor and modify systems around the clock.</p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346850_image3.png\"/></p><p><strong>Technology revolutions are accelerating convergence</strong></p><p>ARK measures the extent to which technology is acting as a catalyst between innovation platforms. The degree of convergence between them is increasing, and network density has increased by 30% in the past year.</p><p>AI is critical to unlocking the value of precision medicine and multi-omics technologies. Smart contract ecosystems are becoming testbeds where autonomous AI agents can be paid for improving their capabilities. Next-generation cloud energy demand is driving the timeline for distributed energy generation. </p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346851_image3.png\"/></p><p></p><p><strong>The accelerated development of neural networks is accelerating the development of all other disruptive technologies</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346852_image3.png\"/></p><p><strong>Advances in artificial intelligence, energy storage, and public blockchains are critical to the pace of technological progress</strong></p><p>Among disruptive technologies, neural networks are the most important catalyst.</p><p>According to our research, advances in neural networks will increase the value of six of the other 14 technologies by at least an order of magnitude, creating a huge market expansion for next-generation cloud, smart devices, autonomous mobility, humanoid robots, precision medicine, and multi-omics technologies. The technological revolution led by AI could lead to a massive increase in productivity and a step-change in economic growth. </p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346853_image3.png\"/></p><p></p><p><strong>Technology inflection points should bring about GDP inflection points</strong></p><p>Structural changes in the underlying macroeconomic growth rate are the rule, not the exception.</p><p>After 100,000 years of economic stagnation, innovation, especially the advent of writing, enabled empires to connect continents, quadrupling real growth rates by 1000 AD.</p><p>Agricultural innovations enabled population density to increase and the labor force to specialize, doubling annual growth rates to 0.3% by 1500.</p><p>In the 400 years before 1900, annual GDP growth doubled again to 0.6% as the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution swept the world.</p><p>The Second Industrial Revolution, marked by electrification, cars, and telephones, ushered in the modern era, quintupling average growth rates to 3% over the past 125 years.</p><p> Technological breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, and biomimetic robots are likely to boost productivity again, achieving another growth step in the next 5 to 10 years. </p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346854_image3.png\"/></p><p><strong>Disruptive innovation may gradually dominate the market</strong></p><p></p><p>Disruptive innovation may account for more than two-thirds of the global stock market, with a compound growth rate of 38% by 2030. </p><p>In the field of innovation, market value may exceed the so-called Mag 6. Non-innovative companies may begin to shrink as technological deflation related to innovation threatens profit margins and competitiveness, even in the context of rapid macroeconomic growth. </p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346855_image3.png\"/></p><h2>III. AI Agents: Redefining consumer interactions and business workflows</h2><p>What are AI Agents? </p><p>AI Agents are expected to accelerate the adoption of digital applications and bring about a revolutionary change in the field of human-computer interaction. </p><p>AI Agents: </p><p>Understand intent through natural language and use reasoning and appropriate context to plan. Use tools to take actions to achieve intent. Improve through iteration and continuous learning. Smarter models that use more tools to complete higher-value tasks. </p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346856_image3.png\"/></p><p></p><p><strong>AI is accelerating the adoption of hardware and software</strong></p><p>OpenAI's revenue may exceed $10 billion in 2025, and its monetization rate is faster than that of social media companies in the past decade. If the adoption of ChatGPT is an indicator, AI should drive rapid demand for a range of new technologies. </p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346857_image3.png\"/></p><p><strong>AI Agents Will Transform Consumer Search and Discovery</strong></p><p>AI Agents are embedded in the operating system of consumer hardware, enabling consumers to delegate all discovery and research to AI, saving a lot of time. Curated AI results will make digital ad impressions more contextual. </p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346858_image3.png\"/></p><p><strong>Digital Advertising Revenue to Share the Largest Share in 2030</strong></p><p>If search shifts to personal AI Agents, AI advertising revenue could surge. By 2030, we believe AI advertising revenue will account for more than 54% of the $1.1 trillion digital advertising market. </p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346859_image3.png\"/></p><p><strong>AI Shopping Could Account for 25% of Global Addressable Online Sales by 2030</strong></p><p>The increasing use of AI Agents in consumer shopping should streamline product discovery, personalization, and purchase.</p><p>ARK research suggests that AI Agents could facilitate nearly $9 trillion in total online spending worldwide by 2030.</p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346860_image3.png\"/></p><p></p><p><strong>Digital Wallets Expected to Continue Expanding Their Share of E-Commerce</strong></p><p>ARK research suggests that digital wallets powered by AI purchasing agents (replacing payment methods such as credit and debit cards) could account for 72% of all e-commerce transactions by 2030. </p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346861_image3.png\"/></p><p></p><p><strong>Digital wallets are consolidating financial services and e-commerce</strong></p><p>The market currently values ​​leading digital wallet platforms such as Block, Robinhood, and SoFi at $1,800 per user based on consumer-facing operations.</p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346862_image3.png\"/></p><p></p><p><strong>Digital wallet procurement agents may become the core of the shopping journey</strong></p><p>Agent lead generation should drive digital wallets upstream to capture market share in global e-commerce and digital consumption. “One-click checkout” should give way to “one-click purchase.” </p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346863_image3.png\"/></p><p><strong>Sourcing Agents Should Increase Enterprise Value of Digital Wallets, Particularly in E-Commerce</strong></p><p>Depending on lead generation rates, AI Agents could generate $40 billion to $200 billion in global revenue for digital wallet platforms in 2030 (ARK’s base and bullish cases, respectively).</p><p>AI Agents could add $50 to $200 in enterprise value (EV) per user of digital wallets in the U.S. by 2030.</p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346864_image3.png\"/></p><p></p><p><strong>In the Enterprise, AI Agents Will Improve Productivity Through Software</strong></p><p>Companies deploying AI Agents should be able to increase unit volume with the same workforce and/or optimize their workforce for higher value activities. As AI advances, AI Agents may handle a higher proportion of workloads and complete higher-value tasks independently.</p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346865_image3.png\"/></p><p></p><p><strong>AI cost reduction will significantly affect the AI ​​Agents economy</strong></p><p>New products from OpenAI and Salesforce are complementing human customer service representatives in a cost-effective way. Even if the fixed cost per conversation is $1, as long as AI Agents can handle 35% of customer service inquiries, it can save companies a lot of money. AI Agents should also reduce onboarding and recruitment costs and seat-based software costs, while being easier to scale than humans.</p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346866_image3.png\"/></p><p></p><p><strong>AI is reshaping the software value chain</strong></p><p>The coding skills of AI Agents are rapidly improving, accelerating the software development cycle. As the cost of creating software falls, software production should accelerate and influence enterprise \"build vs. buy\" decisions, displacing legacy software companies that are less able to adapt. As client software proliferates, growth at all layers of the software stack should accelerate, even as share shifts to the platform layer. </p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346867_image3.png\"/></p><p></p><p><strong>AI will enhance knowledge work</strong></p><p>AI is driving a Cambrian explosion in the software industry. By 2030, we expect the amount of software deployed per knowledge worker to grow significantly as enterprises invest in productivity solutions. Depending on the rate of adoption, global software spending could accelerate from an average of 14% per year over the past decade to an average of 18% to 48% per year. </p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346868_image3.png\"/></p><p></p><h2>Fourth, stablecoins: reshaping the digital asset field</h2><p>As one of the fastest growing areas in digital assets, stablecoins will exceed Mastercard and Visa in terms of transaction volume in 2024</p><p>Despite a two-year bear market and a market value drop of more than 70%, the growth of stablecoins has not been interrupted. In 2024, the annualized transaction volume of stablecoins reached 15.6 trillion US dollars, which is about 119% and 200% of Visa and Mastercard respectively. The monthly transaction volume reached 110 million, accounting for about 0.41% and 0.72% of the transaction volume processed by Visa and Mastercard. In other words, the value of stablecoins per transaction is much higher than that of Visa and Mastercard. </p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346869_image3.png\"/></p><p></p><p><strong>Stablecoin transaction volume hits record high in December 2024</strong></p><p>Solana, Tron, Ethereum and Base are the main public chains driving the growth of stablecoin transaction volume in 2024. A new record was set in December 2024, with daily transaction volume reaching US$270 billion and monthly transaction volume reaching US$2.7 trillion, highlighting the rapid growth of the industry.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346870_image3.png\"/></strong></p><p><strong>Ethena Labs tokenizes popular base transactions and accumulates US$6 billion in 12 months</strong></p><p>Innovation in the stablecoin field is booming, and Ethena Labs is one of the fastest growing projects. Despite criticism for its novel design, the project has captured a large share of the non-fiat-backed stablecoin market and has become a major competitor in this $200 billion space.</p><p>Ethena Labs saw $6 billion in total value locked in its first 12 months. By tokenizing delta-neutral positions, Ethena Labs can offer yields of up to 20%-30%, depending on market conditions. In a bear market, yields could turn negative. Ethena Labs already holds 10% of total Ethereum holdings and is expanding into Solana and Bitcoin delta-neutral trading.</p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346871_image3.png\"/></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>After a drop in 2023, stablecoin supply and the number of active stablecoin addresses hit an all-time high in 2024</strong></p><p>UDST (Tether) continues to dominate the stablecoin space, followed by USDC (Circle). Together, they account for 90% of the total supply. Stablecoins are “multi-chain” and have penetrated almost all major layer 1 blockchains. Stablecoin supply is $203 billion, accounting for about 0.97% of the U.S. M2 money supply. In December, active stablecoin addresses reached 23 million, a record high. Tron is the leading network measured by monthly active addresses, favored by emerging markets for its low transaction fees.</p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346872_image3.png\"/></p><p></p><p><strong>As some countries gradually abandon the dollar, digital assets are moving closer to the dollar</strong></p><p>Digital assets are undergoing “stablecoinization” and “dollarization”, while China and Japan sold record amounts of U.S. Treasuries, Saudi Arabia ended the 45-year petrodollar agreement, and the BRICS reduced their reliance on dollar payments by bypassing the SWIFT network. Historically, Bitcoin and Ethereum have been bridges into the digital asset ecosystem. However, over the past two years, stablecoins have taken their place and now account for 35% to 50% of on-chain transaction volume.</p><p>USD-pegged stablecoins dominate, accounting for more than 98% of supply, followed by gold-backed stablecoins and euro-backed stablecoins, which account for about 1% and about 0.5%, respectively. ARK's research suggests that the market will continue to expand and include stablecoins backed by Asian currencies.</p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346873_image3.png\"/></p><p></p><p><strong>Stablecoins are attracting retail investor interest due to lower costs and higher efficiency of Layer 2</strong></p><p>Retail investors have flocked to Layer 2 for cheaper and more convenient stablecoin transactions, increasing the market share of blockchains such as Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism. Meanwhile, whales and institutions continue to operate on Ethereum's base layer. Transactions below $100 dominate on Base and Optimism, while transactions above $100 dominate on Ethereum’s base layer.</p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346874_image3.png\"/></p><p></p><p><strong>Peer-to-peer transactions and personal wallet storage dominate stablecoin use cases</strong></p><p>Externally owned accounts (EOA) — standard Ethereum addresses used for peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions and storage — account for 60% of USDC usage, while centralized exchanges account for 11%, Ethereum Layer2 cross-chain bridges account for 7%, and decentralized exchanges (DEX) and money markets account for 1.7% each.</p><p>As DeFi usage surges in the coming years, DEXs, Bridges, and money markets are likely to take back market share from P2P. </p><p>While usage of lending markets, DEXs, and Bridges fluctuates with market cycles, P2P trading and storage are more resilient because there is greater product-market fit beyond trading.</p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346875_image3.png\"/></p><p></p><p><strong>Four major stablecoin issuers dominate revenue generated by digital assets</strong></p><p>Tether, which has fewer than 200 employees, reported $5.2 billion in profits in the first half of 2024, including unrealized gains on USDT, the rest of its products and services, and digital assets—clearly one of the most capital-efficient businesses in history.</p><p>Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC) account for 60% of revenue generated by the top five networks and applications. In the second half of 2024, stablecoins USDT, USDC, DAI/USDS, and USDE generated a total of $3.35 billion in revenue, or $6.7 billion on an annualized basis. </p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346876_image3.png\"/></p><p></p><p><strong>Tether's financial performance is amazing, both in absolute and relative terms</strong></p><p>Tether has fewer than 200 employees, while JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway both have more than 300,000 employees.

As of December 2024, Tether and Circle have collectively become the 20th largest holder of U.S. Treasuries.</p><p>Individuals and companies in populous emerging markets such as Brazil, Nigeria, Turkey, Indonesia, and India are adopting stablecoins as a store of value, means of payment, and cross-border currency. Stablecoins could become one of the most efficient ways to export dollars.</p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346878_image3.png\"/></p><p></p><p><strong>Stablecoin issuers are passing on risk-free rates to users</strong></p><p>Circle and Tether have been generating billions of dollars in revenue from Treasury bills and other securities used as collateral for their stablecoins. However, in 2024, in response to competition and demand, stablecoins operating outside the United States began to pass on a significant portion of their interest income to users.</p><p>Circle and Tether are unlikely to follow this trend unless absolutely necessary. Although still small, yield-generating stablecoins are the fastest growing category in the stablecoin market. </p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346879_image3.png\"/></p><p></p><p><strong>By 2030, stablecoins could increase from 0.17% to 0.9% of the global M2 supply of fiat currencies</strong></p><p>Currently, stablecoins are $203 billion, accounting for 0.17% of the global M2 supply. By 2030, stablecoins could increase to $1.4 trillion and 0.9%, respectively. </p><p>By then, stablecoins will become the 13th largest currency in circulation in the world, second only to Spain and ahead of the Netherlands. </p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346880_image3.png\"/></p><p></p><h2>V.

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p></p><p>Source: FT Chinese</p><p>During the Chinese Spring Festival holiday a year ago, OpenAI released the Wensheng video model Sora on February 15, 2024, local time. In several videos generated by Sora, the smooth camera movement and the realistic presentation effect made the domestic large model industry, which was still in the imitation and follow-up stage at that time, fall into great shock and pessimism. For a while, the \"surrender theory\" was rampant, and investors and large companies came out to persuade entrepreneurs to give up their fantasies and turn to applications. Large model entrepreneurship is a \"dead end.\" </p><p>Who would have thought that in this Spring Festival just one year later, everyone was discussing a domestic large model called DeepSeek. In addition to the discussion and screen-sweeping in the technology circle, its application began to penetrate thousands of households, and more ordinary people began to use DeepSeek to customize weight loss recipes, edit holiday greetings, write acrostic poems, and even tell fortunes. <br/></p><p>So far, DeepSeek has launched a total of three generations of models. In May last year, DeepSeek, a subsidiary of Huanfang Quantitative, released DeepSeek-V2, which claimed to be comparable to GPT-4, but the price was only about 1% of GPT-4. The low price triggered a year-long price war for domestic large models. In December, DeepSeek released a new large model, DeepSeek-V3, which reduced the training cost to several million US dollars and was hailed as a \"price butcher\". The DeepSeek-R1 released this time directly targets OpenAI o1. The launch of the \"deep thinking\" and \"online search\" functions has allowed DeepSeek to successfully top the free list in both China and the United States.</p><p>It can be seen that the pace of technological evolution of the three generations of models launched by DeepSeek is very clear. V2 has lowered the price, but the performance advantage does not seem to be obvious. V3 has gradually caught up with the performance under the premise of ultra-low cost. Until R1, the performance is aligned with the most advanced large models in the world on the basis of still low price, which truly achieved the effect of breaking the circle. While the rhythm is clear, the time spent on technology updates is getting shorter and shorter. It took more than half a year from the release of V2 to V3, but only a short month from V3 to R1. </p><p>I mentioned DeepSeek, a startup that only emerged in May last year, in my outlook at the beginning of this year. At that time, I predicted that DeepSeek would definitely become a game-changer in the large model market in the new year. Its low cost and price prove that domestic large models are not without a way out based on the limited computing power and chips. And its \"single-handed challenge\" to a number of wealthy large companies as a startup company refuted the previous AI \"surrender theory\" and gave other entrepreneurs the confidence to continue to dig deep in the field of large models. </p><p>But more importantly, DeepSeek is not only low-priced but also completely open source, which breaks the Matthew effect of technology and capital giants in model training. This was one of the deep concerns about artificial intelligence in the past two years: chips are getting more and more expensive, training costs are getting higher and higher, several large models in the world are gradually becoming closed or even \"oligopolistic\", computing power and data are increasingly in the hands of a few companies, and the entry ticket to AI is getting more and more expensive. Most people may only be bystanders in this AI technology revolution.</p><p>The implementation of the Stargate plan announced by Trump not long ago after he took office will further strengthen this effect. This ambitious AI infrastructure plan has a scale of up to 500 billion US dollars and is led by SoftBank, Oracle and OpenAI. The US government is the backer, big companies are the leader, and then huge funds enter the market... It is obvious that the ultimate goal of this project is to rely on the arms race of capital, chips and computing power to make the United States always the leader in this AI technology revolution.</p><p>The emergence of DeepSeek has at least eliminated the anxiety that the Stargate plan brought to the Chinese AI community. When the superposition of capital and computing power is no longer the only way to advance technology, what does this mean to entrepreneurs and developers? Everyone in the technology circle should be able to predict it. </p><p>It is precisely because of this that DeepSeek is now praised in the public opinion field as \"innovation at the level of national destiny\". Not to mention whether it is flattery to link \"national destiny\" with a startup company, after seeing the past of Huawei and TikTok, raising a company to a political height and placing it at the forefront of the game between major powers will not do any good to the Chinese technology community, where pessimism has just reversed. </p><p>Since DeepSeek has used open source to \"popularize\" the AI ​​ticket, then in the future, based on the rapid reduction of AI costs, the application and innovation of AI in various industries will further explode. The current discussion and thinking should return to the meaning of the market and technology itself: how to create a good market environment so that technological innovation can get positive feedback; how entrepreneurs and ordinary people can use AI to change the world around them. </p><p><mp-style-type></mp-style-type></p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p>Author: Marie Poteriaieva, CoinTelegraph; Compiled by Wuzhu, Golden Finance</p><p>On February 3, Bitcoin fell below $92,000, shocking the cryptocurrency market and triggering up to $2.1 billion in liquidations. Initially, investors seemed prepared for the economic difficulties brought about by the tariff war announced by US President Donald Trump. However, concerns soon shifted to whether Bitcoin had peaked and was about to enter a downtrend.</p><p>More worryingly, Bitcoin Archive points out that every past BTC bull run has peaked within 330 days of breaking the previous cycle's all-time high. February 4 was the 328th day.</p><p>However, Bitcoin quickly rebounded after the drop. The announcement on February 3 of suspending tariffs on Mexico and Canada, as well as a speech by President Trump's cryptocurrency czar David Sacks scheduled for February 4, seemed to reassure the market. </p><p>This raises the question of whether the market has rallied too quickly. Macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges remain, presenting Bitcoin traders with the risk of falling into a bull trap. </p><h2>Bitcoin Demand Remains Strong</h2><p>As the tariff war panic has shown, Bitcoin demand remains strong, continuing to absorb pullbacks — even at all-time highs above $90,000. </p><p>Glassnode’s analysis of Bitcoin’s bull run down suggests that demand for BTC could rise, potentially sparking a “second leg up” in the market. Historical data shows that in the past three cycles (2011-2015, 2015-2018, and 2018-2022), corrections averaged about 25%, followed by an acceleration in price performance during the last third of the bull market.

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p>Source: Denglian Community</p><p>Rollups have developed rapidly. Initially, <span href=\"https://research.2077.xyz/the-practical-guide-to-ethereum-rollups#classic-rollups\">classic rollups</span> provided a short-term solution to Ethereum's scalability challenges. Now, as the technology advances, we are building the next generation of rollups that not only further scale Ethereum, but also retain decentralization, security, and economic sustainability.</p><p>In a four-part series called \"Understanding the Next Generation of L2\", we explore some new types of rollups - Based rollups, Booster rollups, gigagas rollups, native rollups - and aim to introduce these designs to a wide audience. These rollups represent the future of Ethereum scaling, and given @2077Research’s commitment to making Ethereum research and development (R&amp;D) accessible, we thought it was important to educate the community on newer L2 designs. </p><p>Our goal is to quickly introduce these technologies and clarify the concepts involved. In this series, we will break down each rollup type, exploring their design, benefits, tradeoffs, and overall impact on the Ethereum roadmap. Whether you’re an Ethereum enthusiast, developer, or just curious about blockchain scalability, this series is for you. </p><p>The first post looks at Based Rollups — a proposed approach to building rollups that aims to mitigate issues with classic rollups, such as sorter centralization, lifecycle risk, and censorship resistance. We’ll explore how Based Rollups work, the benefits they provide, and the barriers to adoption of Based Rollups. </p><h2><span align-=\"\" background-origin:=\"\" background-position:=\"\" background-repeat:=\"\" background-size:=\"\" height:=\"\" width:=\"\"></span>What is Based rollup?</h2><p>If a rollup uses a sort-based approach to processing transactions, it is called a Based rollup. Sorting refers to how transactions are ordered in a rollup. Based sorting utilizes the validator set of the Layer 1 (L1) chain to sort transactions, rather than relying on a centralized entity (“sorter”) to sort transactions.</p><p>Today, traditional rollups have centralized sorters, which leads to several problems. These problems include censorship of user transactions, risk of single point of failure, and MEV monopoly (centralized sorters can extract MEV (maximum extractable value) from users due to private access to the memory pool).</p><p>Given the problems with centralized sorting, the Ethereum community has been looking for alternatives. Importantly, such alternative ordering designs must meet a key design goal: they must be as efficient and fast as their predecessors. </p><p>Based Ordering and Based Rollups are a positive step in this direction as they provide a new way to order transactions for rollups that inherits Ethereum’s censorship resistance, eliminates single points of failure, and avoids sacrificing speed for decentralization. We describe how Based Rollups work below. </p><h2><span align-=\"\" background-origin:=\"\" background-position:=\"\" background-repeat:=\"\" background-size:=\"\" height:=\"\" width:=\"\"></span>How do Based rollups work? <br/></h2><figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346801_image3.png\"/><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Description of @Spire_Labs' Based rollup architecture</span></figcaption></figure><p>The main difference between a Based rollup and any other type of rollup is the way transactions are ordered. In a Based rollup, transaction ordering is managed by the underlying L1 blockchain (in this case Ethereum). Specifically, in Based Rollup, “any next L1 proposer is free to include subsequent rollup blocks in the next L1 block, along with L1 finders and builders, without special permissions.” In a rollup-based architecture, a user’s transaction is directed to an L1 builder that has agreed to be the Ethereum and L2-based building blocks. The user indicates their maximum transaction fee, the L2 captures the base fee (set based on L2 network congestion) and forwards the priority fee (paid to incentivize transactions to include tips) to validators, who decide on transaction ordering. This arrangement allows Ethereum to not only secure all fees for its ecosystem, but also collect a portion of L2 tips, as well as fees for transaction settlement. Returning value to L1 makes Based Rollups a symbiotic relationship with Ethereum and dispels the notion that rollups are parasitic on Ethereum. Leveraging L1 proposers to provide L2 with a secure, reliable, and reliable blockchain for Ethereum users is a great way to make money. Another benefit of transaction ordering is that it eliminates intermediary steps in the transaction process. This can potentially lead to lower transaction costs by avoiding the need to verify signatures from centralized or decentralized orderers. </p><p>It is worth mentioning that this cost reduction is not unique to Based Rollups; any rollup that uses shared ordering may see similar benefits. Since proposed blocks on L1 are permissionless, this promotes a competitive environment among block builders, which may further reduce fees for users. </p><figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346802_image3.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Description of taiko Based rollup architecture</span></p><p>Since Based Rollup submits its proofs directly to Ethereum, its settlement is essentially on Ethereum. This means that anyone on Ethereum can access the verified state of the L2 chain. Based Rollup cannot be verified on its underlying L1 Based Rollups publish the data needed to reconstruct its chain state on Ethereum, making Ethereum its Data Availability (DA) layer. This allows anyone to verify block hashes and retrieve transaction data from blocks. Based Rollups use Ethereum's consensus layer for transaction ordering, eliminating the need for its own consensus mechanism. Transaction execution in a Based Rollup occurs off-chain within its ecosystem, which means that the Based Rollup itself serves as its own execution layer. For example, existing Based Rollups, such as taiko and SpireLabs, although settled on Ethereum, run on the same L1 but maintain their own unique execution layer to execute transactions. </p><h2><span align-=\"\" background-origin:=\"\" background-position:=\"\" background-repeat:=\"\" background-size:=\"\" height:=\"\" width:=\"\"></span>What are the pros and cons of a Based Rollup design? </h2><p>The advantages of Based Rollups include inheriting Ethereum's security and liveness, potentially reducing transaction costs by eliminating additional ordering, enabling atomic composition of L2 transactions interacting with L1 state, simplifying the architecture without the need for separate consensus, ensuring data availability for all data on Ethereum, and providing strong censorship resistance. </p><p>However, like everything in crypto, Based Rollups have their concerns. Based Rollups rely on Ethereum's performance, which may limit scalability due to Ethereum's block space limitations. L2 operations are still associated with gas costs, which can be considerable. There is also the issue of MEV, where L1 validators may affect transaction ordering. The close connection with Ethereum's consensus and data layer may limit customization for specific use cases. </p><h2><span align-=\"\" background-origin:=\"\" background-position:=\"\" background-repeat:=\"\" background-size:=\"\" height:=\"\" width:=\"\"></span>Based Rollups FAQ</h2><p>In this section, we answer some common questions about Based Rollups. Our goal is to dispel specific misunderstandings about Based Rollups and provide clear information about various aspects of the based rollup architecture. </p><h3><span align-=\"\" background-origin:=\"\" background-position:=\"\" background-repeat:=\"\" background-size:=\"\" height:=\"\" width:=\"\"></span>How is MEV managed in based rollups? </h3><p>Most MEV benefits L1 validators because the incentive for L1 finders and block builders is to include rollup blocks in their L1 packages to capture this value, thereby encouraging L1 proposers to include these blocks. Currently, ~80% of Ethereum MEV comes from congestion and 20% from contention. If L2 MEV reflects this, a large portion may stay on L2. </p><h3><span align-=\"\" background-origin:=\"\" background-position:=\"\" background-repeat:=\"\" background-size:=\"\" height:=\"\" width:=\"\"></span>Is using rollup cheaper for users compared to the alternatives? </h3><p>Using L1 proposers as L2 sorters can save an intermediary step, potentially reducing costs by eliminating sorter signature verification. This cost savings applies not only to rollup-based, but also to shared sorting rollups, as permissionless block proposals promote competition, potentially reducing fees. </p><h3><span align-=\"\" background-origin:=\"\" background-position:=\"\" background-repeat:=\"\" background-size:=\"\" height:=\"\" width:=\"\"></span>Are rollup-based speeds limited to Ethereum's block time? </h3><p>Yes, rollup-based transaction confirmation times are tied to L1's block time, which is currently 12 seconds. However, rollup-based transactions can achieve instant pre-confirmation. This can be achieved through a mechanism similar to re-staking, where some L1 validators commit to including rollup-based blocks in their future L1 blocks. This is possible because validators know who will propose each block 32 blocks in advance. </p><h3><span align-=\"\" background-origin:=\"\" background-position:=\"\" background-repeat:=\"\" background-size:=\"\" height:=\"\" width:=\"\"></span>How “live” is rollup-based liveness? </h3><p>Order-based shares Ethereum’s liveness guarantees, fully inheriting its uptime. Even a slight drop in liveness (e.g., from 100% to 99%) can be exploited under adversarial conditions, leading to significant disruption and toxic MEV. </p><h3><span align-=\"\" background-origin:=\"\" background-position:=\"\" background-repeat:=\"\" background-size:=\"\" height:=\"\" width:=\"\"></span>What is the difference between order-based and shared ordering? </h3><p>Order-based can be viewed as a specialized version of shared ordering. Shared ordering, as a transaction ordering system across multiple rollups, aims to achieve economic efficiency, higher throughput, and faster confirmations than L1. It differs from rollup-based rollups in that it uses its own operators for consensus, making it more complex and not entirely dependent on Ethereum’s liveness. </p><h2><span align-=\"\" background-origin:=\"\" background-position:=\"\" background-repeat:=\"\" background-size:=\"\" height:=\"\" width:=\"\"></span>Conclusion</h2><p>In the first post of our “Rollups 2.0” series, we explored rollup-based rollups, which leverage Ethereum’s validators for transaction ordering, providing a path to decentralization, security, and cost efficiency. </p><p>As we continue in this series, we’ll dive deeper into enhanced rollups, native rollups, and hyperscale rollups — examining how these types of rollups address different aspects of Ethereum’s scalability. </p><p></p><p><mp-style-type></mp-style-type></p></div></div>",
