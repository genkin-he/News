Initially, investors seemed prepared for the economic difficulties brought about by the tariff war announced by US President Donald Trump. However, concerns soon shifted to whether Bitcoin had peaked and was about to enter a downtrend.</p><p>More worryingly, Bitcoin Archive points out that every past BTC bull run has peaked within 330 days of breaking the previous cycle's all-time high. February 4 was the 328th day.</p><p>However, Bitcoin quickly rebounded after the drop. The announcement on February 3 of suspending tariffs on Mexico and Canada, as well as a speech by President Trump's cryptocurrency czar David Sacks scheduled for February 4, seemed to reassure the market. </p><p>This raises the question of whether the market has rallied too quickly. Macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges remain, presenting Bitcoin traders with the risk of falling into a bull trap. </p><h2>Bitcoin Demand Remains Strong</h2><p>As the tariff war panic has shown, Bitcoin demand remains strong, continuing to absorb pullbacks — even at all-time highs above $90,000. </p><p>Glassnode’s analysis of Bitcoin’s bull run down suggests that demand for BTC could rise, potentially sparking a “second leg up” in the market. Historical data shows that in the past three cycles (2011-2015, 2015-2018, and 2018-2022), corrections averaged about 25%, followed by an acceleration in price performance during the last third of the bull market.

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p>Source: Denglian Community</p><p>Rollups have developed rapidly. Initially, <span href=\"https://research.2077.xyz/the-practical-guide-to-ethereum-rollups#classic-rollups\">classic rollups</span> provided a short-term solution to Ethereum's scalability challenges. Now, as the technology advances, we are building the next generation of rollups that not only further scale Ethereum, but also retain decentralization, security, and economic sustainability.</p><p>In a four-part series called \"Understanding the Next Generation of L2\", we explore some new types of rollups - Based rollups, Booster rollups, gigagas rollups, native rollups - and aim to introduce these designs to a wide audience. These rollups represent the future of Ethereum scaling, and given @2077Research’s commitment to making Ethereum research and development (R&amp;D) accessible, we thought it was important to educate the community on newer L2 designs. </p><p>Our goal is to quickly introduce these technologies and clarify the concepts involved. In this series, we will break down each rollup type, exploring their design, benefits, tradeoffs, and overall impact on the Ethereum roadmap. Whether you’re an Ethereum enthusiast, developer, or just curious about blockchain scalability, this series is for you. </p><p>The first post looks at Based Rollups — a proposed approach to building rollups that aims to mitigate issues with classic rollups, such as sorter centralization, lifecycle risk, and censorship resistance. We’ll explore how Based Rollups work, the benefits they provide, and the barriers to adoption of Based Rollups. </p><h2><span align-=\"\" background-origin:=\"\" background-position:=\"\" background-repeat:=\"\" background-size:=\"\" height:=\"\" width:=\"\"></span>What is Based rollup?</h2><p>If a rollup uses a sort-based approach to processing transactions, it is called a Based rollup. Sorting refers to how transactions are ordered in a rollup. Based sorting utilizes the validator set of the Layer 1 (L1) chain to sort transactions, rather than relying on a centralized entity (“sorter”) to sort transactions.</p><p>Today, traditional rollups have centralized sorters, which leads to several problems. These problems include censorship of user transactions, risk of single point of failure, and MEV monopoly (centralized sorters can extract MEV (maximum extractable value) from users due to private access to the memory pool).</p><p>Given the problems with centralized sorting, the Ethereum community has been looking for alternatives. Importantly, such alternative ordering designs must meet a key design goal: they must be as efficient and fast as their predecessors. </p><p>Based Ordering and Based Rollups are a positive step in this direction as they provide a new way to order transactions for rollups that inherits Ethereum’s censorship resistance, eliminates single points of failure, and avoids sacrificing speed for decentralization. We describe how Based Rollups work below. </p><h2><span align-=\"\" background-origin:=\"\" background-position:=\"\" background-repeat:=\"\" background-size:=\"\" height:=\"\" width:=\"\"></span>How do Based rollups work? <br/></h2><figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346801_image3.png\"/><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Description of @Spire_Labs' Based rollup architecture</span></figcaption></figure><p>The main difference between a Based rollup and any other type of rollup is the way transactions are ordered. In a Based rollup, transaction ordering is managed by the underlying L1 blockchain (in this case Ethereum). Specifically, in Based Rollup, “any next L1 proposer is free to include subsequent rollup blocks in the next L1 block, along with L1 finders and builders, without special permissions.” In a rollup-based architecture, a user’s transaction is directed to an L1 builder that has agreed to be the Ethereum and L2-based building blocks. The user indicates their maximum transaction fee, the L2 captures the base fee (set based on L2 network congestion) and forwards the priority fee (paid to incentivize transactions to include tips) to validators, who decide on transaction ordering. This arrangement allows Ethereum to not only secure all fees for its ecosystem, but also collect a portion of L2 tips, as well as fees for transaction settlement. Returning value to L1 makes Based Rollups a symbiotic relationship with Ethereum and dispels the notion that rollups are parasitic on Ethereum. Leveraging L1 proposers to provide L2 with a secure, reliable, and reliable blockchain for Ethereum users is a great way to make money. Another benefit of transaction ordering is that it eliminates intermediary steps in the transaction process. This can potentially lead to lower transaction costs by avoiding the need to verify signatures from centralized or decentralized orderers. </p><p>It is worth mentioning that this cost reduction is not unique to Based Rollups; any rollup that uses shared ordering may see similar benefits. Since proposed blocks on L1 are permissionless, this promotes a competitive environment among block builders, which may further reduce fees for users. </p><figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346802_image3.png\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Description of taiko Based rollup architecture</span></p><p>Since Based Rollup submits its proofs directly to Ethereum, its settlement is essentially on Ethereum. This means that anyone on Ethereum can access the verified state of the L2 chain. Based Rollup cannot be verified on its underlying L1 Based Rollups publish the data needed to reconstruct its chain state on Ethereum, making Ethereum its Data Availability (DA) layer. This allows anyone to verify block hashes and retrieve transaction data from blocks. Based Rollups use Ethereum's consensus layer for transaction ordering, eliminating the need for its own consensus mechanism. Transaction execution in a Based Rollup occurs off-chain within its ecosystem, which means that the Based Rollup itself serves as its own execution layer. For example, existing Based Rollups, such as taiko and SpireLabs, although settled on Ethereum, run on the same L1 but maintain their own unique execution layer to execute transactions. </p><h2><span align-=\"\" background-origin:=\"\" background-position:=\"\" background-repeat:=\"\" background-size:=\"\" height:=\"\" width:=\"\"></span>What are the pros and cons of a Based Rollup design? </h2><p>The advantages of Based Rollups include inheriting Ethereum's security and liveness, potentially reducing transaction costs by eliminating additional ordering, enabling atomic composition of L2 transactions interacting with L1 state, simplifying the architecture without the need for separate consensus, ensuring data availability for all data on Ethereum, and providing strong censorship resistance. </p><p>However, like everything in crypto, Based Rollups have their concerns. Based Rollups rely on Ethereum's performance, which may limit scalability due to Ethereum's block space limitations. L2 operations are still associated with gas costs, which can be considerable. There is also the issue of MEV, where L1 validators may affect transaction ordering. The close connection with Ethereum's consensus and data layer may limit customization for specific use cases. </p><h2><span align-=\"\" background-origin:=\"\" background-position:=\"\" background-repeat:=\"\" background-size:=\"\" height:=\"\" width:=\"\"></span>Based Rollups FAQ</h2><p>In this section, we answer some common questions about Based Rollups. Our goal is to dispel specific misunderstandings about Based Rollups and provide clear information about various aspects of the based rollup architecture. </p><h3><span align-=\"\" background-origin:=\"\" background-position:=\"\" background-repeat:=\"\" background-size:=\"\" height:=\"\" width:=\"\"></span>How is MEV managed in based rollups? </h3><p>Most MEV benefits L1 validators because the incentive for L1 finders and block builders is to include rollup blocks in their L1 packages to capture this value, thereby encouraging L1 proposers to include these blocks. Currently, ~80% of Ethereum MEV comes from congestion and 20% from contention. If L2 MEV reflects this, a large portion may stay on L2. </p><h3><span align-=\"\" background-origin:=\"\" background-position:=\"\" background-repeat:=\"\" background-size:=\"\" height:=\"\" width:=\"\"></span>Is using rollup cheaper for users compared to the alternatives? </h3><p>Using L1 proposers as L2 sorters can save an intermediary step, potentially reducing costs by eliminating sorter signature verification. This cost savings applies not only to rollup-based, but also to shared sorting rollups, as permissionless block proposals promote competition, potentially reducing fees. </p><h3><span align-=\"\" background-origin:=\"\" background-position:=\"\" background-repeat:=\"\" background-size:=\"\" height:=\"\" width:=\"\"></span>Are rollup-based speeds limited to Ethereum's block time? </h3><p>Yes, rollup-based transaction confirmation times are tied to L1's block time, which is currently 12 seconds. However, rollup-based transactions can achieve instant pre-confirmation. This can be achieved through a mechanism similar to re-staking, where some L1 validators commit to including rollup-based blocks in their future L1 blocks. This is possible because validators know who will propose each block 32 blocks in advance. </p><h3><span align-=\"\" background-origin:=\"\" background-position:=\"\" background-repeat:=\"\" background-size:=\"\" height:=\"\" width:=\"\"></span>How “live” is rollup-based liveness? </h3><p>Order-based shares Ethereum’s liveness guarantees, fully inheriting its uptime. Even a slight drop in liveness (e.g., from 100% to 99%) can be exploited under adversarial conditions, leading to significant disruption and toxic MEV. </p><h3><span align-=\"\" background-origin:=\"\" background-position:=\"\" background-repeat:=\"\" background-size:=\"\" height:=\"\" width:=\"\"></span>What is the difference between order-based and shared ordering? </h3><p>Order-based can be viewed as a specialized version of shared ordering. Shared ordering, as a transaction ordering system across multiple rollups, aims to achieve economic efficiency, higher throughput, and faster confirmations than L1. It differs from rollup-based rollups in that it uses its own operators for consensus, making it more complex and not entirely dependent on Ethereum’s liveness. </p><h2><span align-=\"\" background-origin:=\"\" background-position:=\"\" background-repeat:=\"\" background-size:=\"\" height:=\"\" width:=\"\"></span>Conclusion</h2><p>In the first post of our “Rollups 2.0” series, we explored rollup-based rollups, which leverage Ethereum’s validators for transaction ordering, providing a path to decentralization, security, and cost efficiency. </p><p>As we continue in this series, we’ll dive deeper into enhanced rollups, native rollups, and hyperscale rollups — examining how these types of rollups address different aspects of Ethereum’s scalability. </p><p></p><p><mp-style-type></mp-style-type></p></div></div>",

That’s a potential boon for users, but a blow to big tech stocks that have poured billions into their projects, and a blow to the idea that the U.S. is ahead of the rest of the world in AI.</p><p>It’s a big shift, though how much of a difference it will make remains to be seen. “We are still shocked that tech investors think DeepSeek will dramatically change the $2 trillion in AI spending expected over the next three years,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a research note.</p><p>Investor focus then almost immediately turned to earnings from Meta Platforms (META), Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). They did their best to reassure the market, and the first three succeeded, while the last failed. Overall, though, comments from tech company management gave investors some comfort, and many even saw a positive side.  </p><p>While investors are concerned about Silicon Valley's dominance in artificial intelligence, the S&amp;P 500 was essentially flat as of Thursday's close: the index did not fall again to the lows it hit last Monday, with 333 components rising and 169 falling. \"Stable short-term breadth is a sign of strength in the stock market,\" said Ed Clissold, strategist at Ned Davis Research.</p><p><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346792_image3.png\"/></p><p>Meanwhile, Tom Essaye, president of Sevens Report, pointed out that economic data also performed well. \"The fourth-quarter GDP data was slightly weak, but not particularly weak, consumer spending remained strong, and the U.S. economy was basically in a 'Goldilocks' state,\" he wrote in his research report. The Federal Reserve, which was on the sidelines, announced that it would keep interest rates unchanged after concluding a two-day meeting, which did not have much impact on the stock market. </p><p>All is not calm in Washington, D.C., however, and a sustained stock market rally is never a sure thing. A pleasant rally turned to a decline on Friday when President Donald Trump reiterated that he would impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada.</p><p>Starting on February 4, the United States will impose 25% tariffs on goods imported from Mexico and Canada, 10% tariffs on energy products imported from Canada, and 10% tariffs on China.</p><p>The speed with which the new tariffs have arrived appears to be undermining hopes that Trump will be able to use tariffs as a negotiating tool to any great extent. The new U.S. tariffs have already triggered threats of retaliation from other countries, and Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on goods imported from the European Union. </p><p>ING economist Inga Fechner wrote in a research note, \"Almost half of U.S. imports will be subject to higher tariffs, which could disrupt supply chains and severely affect the economies of the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p></p><p>Source: Zuoye Waiboshan</p><p></p><p><span leaf=\"\">I thought that the map opening was only for small islands, but I didn’t expect that the world-class hegemon would follow this old practice; I thought that the ETH L2 ecosystem was chaotic enough, but I didn’t expect that the world trade system has gradually broken down; I thought that Web3 settlement was just a dream, but I didn’t expect that stablecoins have become a new pillar.</span></p><p><span leaf=\"\">On February 1, 2025, Trump began to \"fulfill his promise\" and began to increase tariffs on Mexico and Canada. In addition to Canadian energy products, goods imported from the two countries will increase by an additional 25%.</span></p><p><span leaf=\"\">Although Trump’s style has always been to exert extreme pressure, the final tariffs may not necessarily come true 100%, but once the bow is drawn, there is no turning back. The core economic idea of ​​Trump 2.0 is to replace \"domestic taxes\" with tariffs, so that the United States can return to the good old days without IRS. </span></p><p><span leaf=\"\">Of course, Americans are not stupid enough to believe Trump's rhetoric and really think that increasing tariffs and stabilizing prices can coexist. In the completely deindustrialized United States, all goods are imported products. It's just that from the American temple to the people, they have entered a quasi-wartime state. In order to win the final victory, temporary pain is necessary. </span></p><h2><span leaf=\"\">Crypto War Economy</span></h2><p><span leaf=\"\">After the start of the tariff war 2.0, the crypto market was the first to bear the brunt. Bitcoin fell to 97,000, and the entire market entered a downward cycle, just as fragile as the previous A-share market. </span></p><p><span leaf=\"\">In theory, the crypto market is a global market. Even if you are not optimistic about the US tariff war against the world, there should be a large amount of funds entering the market for risk aversion, but the premise of all this is that the currency circle is indeed a global market. </span></p><p><span leaf=\"\">Unfortunately, the emergence of DeepSeek has broken the stereotype that the U.S. stock market is the global market. If you have a good memory, you will remember that not long ago, when DeepSeek V3 released a technical report on December 26, 2024, the cryptocurrency industry was the first to accept and recognize its advanced nature, earlier than the general public. </span></p><p></p><figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><span leaf=\"\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346787_image3.png\"/></span></figure><figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Image Description: Overall trend of AI Agent, Image source: Coingecko</span></figure><p></p><p></p><p><span leaf=\"\">AI Agent is still thriving at this time. The real crisis lies in the successive launches of $TRUMP and DeepSeek R1. From January 17 to January 20, in just three days, the world has experienced two waves of shock. The president will really issue currency, and Chinese AI will temporarily lead the United States. </span></p><p><span leaf=\"\">Or to put it this way, this wave of AI Agent narratives in the cryptocurrency circle is based on two premises:</span></p><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"><li><p><span leaf=\"\">American AI is the only one in the world, and AI Agent is first of all Pax Americana AI Agent. OpenAI needs to maintain its lead in algorithms, and Nvidia chips are irreplaceable in hardware;</span></p></li><li><p><span leaf=\"\">AI Agent has not generated real profits, nor has it attracted real users. The liquidity sucked away by $TRUMP will not flow back without thinking. It is still narrative economics, not a PMF product.</span></p></li></ol><p><span leaf=\"\">The world line converges and returns to the trade war.</span></p><p><span leaf=\"\">In the face of the sharp decline of Nvidia and other Magnificent 7 giants in the US stock market, the AI ​​Agent track and the chaos of the Ethereum Foundation and Binance seem insignificant. </span></p><p><span leaf=\"\">Nvidia's chips, the price of Bitcoin, if these are Plan A and B of the US revitalization plan, then they are currently being questioned. The only solution is to rebuild the confidence of the global capital market in the United States. </span></p><p><span leaf=\"\">Tariffs and trade wars will only be the first move. The core is the rise of US stocks and interest rate cuts. The United States needs to cut interest rates to stabilize the economy, but at the same time, as a global financial country, the stock market cannot have any problems, and can only rise but not fall. Therefore, there is only one option, which is the rise of US stocks. </span></p><p><span leaf=\"\">In normal economic theory, these two are not easy to have at the same time, but the magical $TRUMP can bypass the existing fiscal-monetary system, and tariffs and trade wars will create government financial resources in the short term. There is also Musk's layoffs. The remaining funds can only be gathered in the capital market, unless someone really goes to the United States to open a factory. </span></p><p><span leaf=\"\">In this system, the short-term driving force is that tariffs need to work, so it can be inferred that even if Canada compromises with Trump, Trump's tariffs on the world will only intensify. </span></p><p><span leaf=\"\">In the long run, the fiscal role of cryptocurrency will be inevitable, that is, either the US dollar-Federal Reserve system will get rid of its nominal independence and reach a closer political cooperation with Trump, or the Trump administration will continue to use unconventional means to \"command\" the US dollar. </span></p><p><span leaf=\"\">But there is no doubt that for cryptocurrency itself, the current driving force is no longer blockchain technology or decentralized concepts. After all, Vitalik himself admits that he has ultimate control over the Ethereum Foundation. The real master of the currency circle is already a real political force. The largest CEX must stand in line, the issuer and operator of USDT must stand in line, and even every coin trader must make his own choice. </span></p><p><span leaf=\"\">The wartime state has become a reality in 2025. </span></p><h2><span leaf=\"\">Two Worlds</span></h2><p><span leaf=\"\">Looking at the main theme of 2025, the fragmentation of world trade has become a reality. Regionalization has actually replaced the old globalization centered on the United States and based on the WTO mechanism. The only thing left is that the US dollar is still the global currency.</span></p><p><span leaf=\"\">In fact, Trump has repeatedly warned the BRICS countries not to challenge the status of the US dollar, but everyone understands that if the United States does not participate in global trade, it is very strange to use the currency of a non-trading country, but everyone also understands that no country or organization’s currency can challenge the status of the US dollar.</span></p><p><span leaf=\"\">It is rare in the world to be so entangled. </span></p><p><span leaf=\"\">Blockchain technology has been tried. The mBridge project in which the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) participated is one example. It focuses on settlement between CBDCs. The People's Bank of China, the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and other central banks and enterprises in many countries and regions have tried it.</span></p><p><span leaf=\"\">However, BIS cannot bridge the divided world. BIS has withdrawn from the mBridge project. The reason is that too many BRICS countries are involved. BIS may be accused by the West of helping Russia and other countries evade sanctions. BIS can only launch the Agorá project. The participants are South Korea, Japan, the European Union and other countries. It is clear at a glance that the East and the West are clearly divided.</span></p><p><span leaf=\"\">Web3 projects also continue to advance. The concept of PayFi has entered a long-term construction stage. Huma Finance hopes to open up cross-border settlement for enterprises in the post-Ripple era. The means can only be stablecoins, but the power of a project is ultimately limited. B2B has become the most mainstream choice, and ordinary people are ultimately out of reach. </span></p><p><span leaf=\"\">Web3 super individuals are at a loss. In the era of CEX explosion, holding Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even BNB can outperform, but in the PVP era, super individuals need to face the super-fast response of robots, the cannibalistic offensive of the currency issuing group, and the unscrupulous PUA of unscrupulous VCs. The old world is gone after all. </span></p><p><span leaf=\"\">Last year, Web3 settlement based on stablecoins may be the biggest trend in the industry, but it is hard to say now. After the AI ​​Agent was shut down, the entire industry entered a boring and lengthy soap opera mode, and began to complain about trivial matters. VCs said that they suffered from 6 times the return, and CEX said that they suffered from the market value of 100 billion and the transaction volume of 100 trillion for the platform currency. </span></p><h2><span leaf=\"\">Conclusion</span></h2><p><span leaf=\"\">There is no real empathy in this world, and humans cannot empathize with their own kind, but before the epic correction of the US stock market, I hope we still have a chance. </span></p><p><span leaf=\"\">From any angle, this DeepSeek surprise attack is just a preview of the next long and tense war. I hope we can be prepared before that. </span></p><p><mp-style-type></mp-style-type></p></div></div>",
