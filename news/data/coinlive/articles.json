            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p><strong>Is your current situation of speculating in cryptocurrencies in the past year the same: you are always one step behind the media in grabbing hot spots, you only chase high prices after seeing KOL propaganda, you can never hold on to the coins you bought, and you can never get out of them after holding on. </strong></p><p>In the final analysis, it‚Äôs not that you don‚Äôt have opportunities, but that the information is slow, the rhythm is chaotic, and the emotions collapse first. For example, in the recent TRUMP hot spot, many KOLs and smart money addresses made a lot of money in just a few days, but you are wandering between missing out and FOMO, and your anxiety is directly maxed out. <strong>What did these winners do right? </strong></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><img alt=\"5Zbxqgx1yK6Tdn2h7a3VtA9lrAGjGuT1D1MZX0FF.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7346728_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7346728\"/></strong></p><h2><strong>Can you really get information effectively? </strong>¬†</h2><p>Many people focus on the so-called \"smart money\" movements, but it is far from enough. <strong>One of the real keys is to capture the emotional fluctuations on social media, especially those led by</strong><strong>KOL</strong><strong>or the community. The heat of the market often comes from the fermentation of these hot topics - the discussion and community sentiment on social platforms are the real signals of short-term opportunities. </strong>Although everyone understands that the rise and fall of the market is often not only driven by technology, but also by the emotional fluctuations of social media, these emotions are always ignored. ¬†</p><p><strong>The most difficult thing is that the media will report the hot spots of the market at the first time, but you may not have enough interpretation ability to quickly judge the true value and potential impact of this information. </strong>Whenever you see news reported by a certain media, it is often biased or one-sided, and you can only rely on your intuition to filter out the valuable parts, ignoring the complex signals that may be hidden behind it. ¬†</p><p><strong>And now your time is fragmented. Every time you want to find key information, you will be overwhelmed by various scattered resources. News media, social platforms, and KOL's dynamics are all scattered in different places. As a result, you have to flip through more than a dozen tabs to piece together a little useful content, which is time-consuming and laborious, and finally find that the information is still incomplete. </strong>¬†</p><p>Don't mention those more experienced players. For example, when some people do currency analysis, they need to repeatedly try to search on Twitter with various keywords such as currency name, project name, contract address, etc. before they can find relevant content. Twitter itself has messy content and does not support information query classified by currency. High-quality information is like looking for a needle in a haystack. In addition, most of the content on Twitter is in English. If you want to understand it, you can only translate it one post at a time, which is really a waste of time. At the same time, mainstream media are constantly publishing reports about this information, but you lack the ability to analyze and interpret information in depth. ¬†</p><p>If you are a novice in the currency circle, the situation is even worse. You have no idea where to find relevant content, let alone which KOLs are worth paying attention to and which media information is high-quality. By the time you finally start to pay attention to a hot spot, the market opportunity has already slipped away. At this time, the rapid media coverage may have exacerbated market volatility and caused you to miss real opportunities. ¬†</p><p>But now, these problems are no longer problems! <strong>Because</strong><strong>OKX</strong><strong>has launched a new</strong><strong>‚Äú</strong><strong>Dynamics</strong><strong>‚Äù</strong><strong>feature and integrated it into</strong><strong>Web3</strong><strong>wallets!</strong><strong>If you have also encountered the above problems, then you should quickly experience this product feature!</strong>¬†</p><h2><strong>What is the use of the</strong><strong>OKX</strong><strong>‚Äú</strong><strong>Dynamics</strong><strong>‚Äù</strong><strong>feature?</strong>¬†</h2><p>In short, the<strong>OKX</strong><strong>‚Äú</strong><strong>Dynamics</strong><strong>‚Äù</strong><strong>feature is a one-stop industry information resource library, designed for users of different levels, whether you are a newbie or a veteran player, it can help you quickly find the matching content you need and improve the quality of trading decisions.</strong></p><p><strong>The \"Dynamics\" function helps you quickly obtain important information and intelligently classify it by real-time aggregation of industry media news, KOL dynamics and market discussions. </strong>It is organized not only by currency, but also by theme, effectively solving the problem of information overload and fragmentation. For those who are new to the industry, it helps you quickly find key content and influential KOL resources, allowing you to quickly grasp industry trends; while for experienced users, it helps you focus on the core content, avoid the interference of irrelevant information, and ensure that you always pay attention to the most important market dynamics. </p><p><strong>Secondly, another highlight of the \"Dynamics\" function is the intelligent screening through AI technology to accurately locate the core information. No matter which currency you are interested in, you no longer need to try keywords such as project name, token abbreviation, contract address, etc. on multiple platforms. AI will provide news, discussions and KOL opinions related to your interests based on your focus, allowing you to focus on truly valuable content. This precise screening mechanism improves the efficiency of information acquisition, helping you save time and speed up decision-making. </strong></p><p><strong>In addition, the built-in real-time translation function of </strong><strong>\"</strong><strong>Dynamics</strong><strong>\" solves the problem of global language barriers. </strong>The hot spots in the crypto market often heat up first from overseas discussions, but language barriers cause many users to miss key information. The OKX \"Dynamics\" function has built-in real-time translation technology, whether it is English information on Twitter or discussions in other languages, it can be presented synchronously in the language you are familiar with. From the views of KOLs in the Chinese and English circles to the preferences of other countries for Tokens, you can see at a glance and easily understand the global market dynamics. The \"Dynamics\" function not only breaks the boundaries of language, but also allows you to gain insight into market trends from a global perspective, make decisions from a broader perspective, and seize opportunities in changes. </p><h2><strong>How to use it quickly? </strong>¬†</h2><p><strong>OKX</strong><strong>launched</strong><strong>the</strong><strong>‚Äú</strong><strong>Following</strong><strong>the</strong><strong>news</strong><strong>feature</strong><strong>on</strong><strong>both</strong><strong>the</strong><strong>exchange</strong><strong>and</strong><strong>Web3</strong><strong>wallet</strong><strong>, becoming</strong><strong>the</strong><strong>first</strong><strong>exchange</strong><strong>to</strong><strong>provide</strong><strong>Twitter</strong><strong>and</strong><strong>news</strong><strong>aggregation</strong><strong>on</strong><strong>both</strong><strong>the</strong><strong>exchange</strong><strong>and</strong><strong>the ...you</strong><strong>with</strong><strong>the</strong><strong>news</strong><strong>feature</strong><strong>in</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>d</strong><strong>way</strong><strong>,</strong><strong>so</strong><strong>you</strong><strong>can</strong><strong>use</strong><strong>automatic</strong><strong>capture</strong><strong>information,</strong><strong>enabling</strong><strong> </strong></p><p>For DEX users, OKX's Web3 wallet function also brings huge improvements. Traditionally, when you make a trading decision, you usually need to check multiple information platforms, such as news websites, Twitter, or specialized analysis tools, and then go to DEX to trade. This process not only disperses information, but also leads to delays in decision-making. <strong>However, </strong><strong>OKX</strong><strong>'s </strong><strong>\" ...

By improving transparency, OKX ensures the openness and fairness of market information, helping users make more informed decisions. At the same time, the efficient operation of the platform enables every user to seize opportunities in the ever-changing market, achieve rapid response and accurate transactions.</p><p>OKX's \"Dynamic\" function is not only a reflection of technological innovation, but also a precise response to users' deep needs. <strong>It fundamentally solves two core problems: How to efficiently extract valuable information from complex data streams? And how to respond quickly when information is lagging? </strong></p><p>When information becomes the engine that drives the market forward, mastering the initiative of information flow becomes the key to determining the future direction. Through the \"Dynamic\" function, OKX is no longer limited to traditional information dissemination, but creates a new information ecology through real-time market dynamics and intelligent analysis. This means that users can receive key market information at the same speed and at the first time no matter where they are, breaking the time lag in information transmission and significantly improving the efficiency and accuracy of trading decisions. </p><p>The innovation of the \"Dynamic\" function is not only an optimization of the way of information transmission, but also breaks through the traditional information barriers through technical means, promoting the openness and transparency of the market. Users on the OKX platform are not only traders, but also participants in information flow and promoters of market evolution. In this sense, what OKX \"Dynamic\" provides is not only a trading tool, but also a new perspective, allowing you to gain insight into micro-changes in a complex market environment and go further. </p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p><p>This content is for reference only and does not constitute and should not be considered as (i) investment advice or recommendation, (ii) an offer or solicitation to buy, sell or hold digital assets, or (iii) financial, accounting, legal or tax advice.

            "title": "Bitwise: Trump's tariff war will ultimately benefit Bitcoin",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p>Author: Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer, Bitwise; Jeff Park, Portfolio Manager, Head of Alpha Strategies; Translator: 0xjs@ÈªÑÈáëË¥¢Áªè</p><p>The cryptocurrency market fell sharply in the past few days, with Bitcoin down about 5% and many other assets falling even more. As I wrote this article on Monday morning in London (where I was attending a conference), Ethereum fell 17%, Solana fell 8%, and XRP fell 18%.</p><p>The direct cause of the decline is concerns about a global trade war. Last weekend, President Trump imposed a 25% tariff on most imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on China, and the three countries announced corresponding response plans. The move caused the dollar to rise by more than 1% against other major currencies and caused stock futures and cryptocurrency prices to fall sharply.</p><p>Of course, since this is crypto technology, the trouble is not just that.</p><p>In the field of cryptocurrencies, due to the widespread use of leverage, sharp market fluctuations (especially on weekends with low liquidity) tend to be self-exacerbated. Negative news events cause prices to pull back, which causes leveraged traders to close their positions by selling, which causes prices to keep falling, forcing more people to close their positions. This process continues until leverage is exhausted. </p><p>Sure enough, the largest liquidation event in crypto history occurred in the 24 hours from Sunday night to Monday morning, with perhaps as much as $10 billion in leveraged positions being liquidated. </p><p>Bitwise investors tend to be long-term investors, so these short-term, leverage-driven pullbacks are viewed by most as opportunities rather than threats - as long as the news event is truly short-term. </p><p>So, is it really so? That's the trillion-dollar question. </p><p>My colleague Jeff Park, who leads Bitwise's Alpha team, is one of the sharpest minds at the intersection of macro and crypto. His view is that <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>Trump's economic game plan, including the implementation of tariffs, is actually a long-term positive catalyst for Bitcoin. </strong></span></p><p>I asked Jeff to share his perspective below:</p><p>The upshot is: <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\">Bitcoin wins, fiat loses. In either case, Bitcoin goes higher.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>To understand the long-term impact of tariffs on Bitcoin, there are two things to remember: 1) the curse of the ‚ÄúTriffin Dilemma,‚Äù and 2) President Trump‚Äôs long-term goals.</strong></span></p><p>The first is the ‚ÄúTriffin Dilemma.‚Äù Named after the Belgian-American economist who coined the term in the 1960s, the dilemma refers to the fact that being the world‚Äôs reserve currency has both advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>On the negative side, the dollar is structurally overvalued because other countries need it as a reserve currency (regardless of its price), and the U.S. must run a persistent trade deficit to supply dollars to the world. On the plus side, the U.S. government can continue to borrow at a lower cost than it ‚Äúshould‚Äù because there are consistent buyers for its debt. </p><p>Trump wants to eliminate the negatives and keep the positives. </p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>How does Trump plan to achieve this? Tariffs. </strong></span></p><p>Tariffs are usually temporary negotiating tools to achieve a goal - that seems to be the case this time. <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>We believe the ultimate goal is to reach a multilateral agreement that weakens the dollar without raising long-term interest rates. </strong></span>One possible way to do this is to force countries to reduce their dollar reserves while extending the maturity of Treasury bonds. This would suppress long-term interest rates while supporting the U.S. manufacturing base. </p><p>But how do you get countries to agree to this? You have to force them to the negotiating table. </p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\">The US has done this before. In 1985, West Germany, France, the UK, and Japan signed the famous Plaza Accord, which <strong>called for an orderly devaluation of the dollar against other currencies. </strong>The agreement was a huge boost to US manufacturers, which had previously struggled to compete on the global stage due to the strength of the dollar. (Why did these countries sign the agreement? One reason was‚Äîyou guessed it‚Äîthe fear of tariffs.)</span></p><p><strong>If Trump can bully his way to this outcome, there is no asset more favorable than Bitcoin. Lower interest rates will stimulate risk appetite among US investors, pushing up Bitcoin prices. Abroad, countries will face economic weakness and will resort to traditional economic stimulus to compensate, again pushing up Bitcoin prices.</strong></p><p>What if he fails? What if we get a prolonged tariff war? We firmly believe that the resulting economic weakness will lead to more money printing than ever before. Historically, such stimulus has been very bullish for Bitcoin.</p></div></div>",

            "title": "SEC Commissioner Peirce: Top Ten Tasks for the Crypto Working Group to Do in the Future",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p>Author: SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce; Translator: Deng Tong, Golden Finance</p><p>When I was a kid, my family made an annual road trip from Ohio to Maine and back. It was a different time. There were no cell phones to call for help if the car broke down. Paper maps and directions were written on scraps of paper, not cell phone apps that gave you step-by-step instructions. Forget booking a hotel online; you just looked for the sign in the distance and stopped to see if there was a vacancy. There were no podcasts or audiobooks, just a noisy radio trying to find a local station. Instead of watching videos on the back screen, my brothers and I scanned the license plates of passing cars and ‚Äúcollected‚Äù states in a technology-free game of road trip. Today‚Äôs road trips are very different. In most ways, technology has made them a more fun and less risky activity.</p><p>The crypto journeys that the newly announced Crypto Task Force[1] is embarking on should similarly be more fun and less risky than the ones the Commission has led the industry on for the past decade. On that last journey, the Commission refused to use the regulatory tools at its disposal and kept pumping the enforcement brakes as it lurched forward on a winding route with no one knowing where to go. But just as modern technology does not eliminate the risks of taking the open road, this new journey toward regulatory clarity remains perilous, and both the Commission and the public need to remain vigilant and aware of the risks and opportunities that may exist. I am grateful to have an excellent team of talented SEC staff accompanying me on this journey, and we look forward to engaging with the many passionate members of the public who will help us navigate this journey. With all of this help, I am hopeful that we can arrive in a better place than we ever imagined on our previous cryptocurrency journeys. Before I discuss the hopes and opportunities that the Working Group represents, let me start with some important disclaimers. </p><p>First, while I am currently entrusted with the important task of leading the SEC‚Äôs new Cryptocurrency Working Group, the views expressed are my own as a Commissioner and do not represent the views of the SEC or my fellow Commissioners. Commission positions always require a Commission vote. </p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>Second, it took a long time to get into this mess, and it will take some time to get out of it. </strong></span>The Commission has been involved in the crypto industry in one form or another for more than a decade. The first bitcoin exchange-traded product application came before us in 2013, and the same year the Commission filed a fraud case involving a crypto element. [2] In 2017, we issued the DAO Section 21(a) Report, which reflected the first application of the Howey test in this context. [3] Since then, there have been numerous enforcement actions, many no-action letters, some exemptions from relief, endless talk about crypto in speeches and statements, numerous meetings with crypto entrepreneurs, many interagency and international crypto working groups, discussions of certain aspects of crypto in proposed rulemakings, consideration of crypto-related issues in reviews of registration statements and other filings, and approval of numerous SRO-proposed rule changes to list crypto exchange-traded products. Throughout this time, the Commission‚Äôs treatment of cryptocurrencies has been marked by legal laxity and commercial impracticality. As a result, many cases remain in litigation, many rules remain in proposals, and many market participants remain in uncertainty. Determining how best to unravel all of these issues, including ongoing litigation, will take time. It will involve work across the agency and in collaboration with other regulators. Please be patient. The Task Force wants to achieve good results, but we need to do so in an orderly, practical, and legal manner. </p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>Third, the Task Force wants to get to a place where people are free to experiment and build interesting things, and where it is not a haven for fraudsters. </strong></span>One of the reasons that U.S. capital markets are so strong, efficient, and effective is that we have rules in place that are designed to protect investors and the integrity of our markets, and we enforce them. We have no tolerance for liars, cheaters, and scammers. As the Task Force works to help develop this regulatory framework, it will carefully consider anti-fraud protections. If the Commission finds that fraud is beyond our jurisdiction, it can refer the matter to sister regulators. If it does not fall within the jurisdiction of any regulator, the Commission can notify Congress of the loophole. </p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>Fourth, the Task Force is working to help create a regulatory framework that both achieves the Commission‚Äôs important regulatory goals (including protecting investors) and preserves the industry‚Äôs ability to provide products and services. </strong></span>That framework will be within the Commission‚Äôs statutory authority, and we will work with other regulators operating within their statutory authority. Existing regulations do not allow products under our jurisdiction to compete freely. Congress has set the parameters, and the Commission will apply them. Congress has also given us waivers, and the Commission will use them where appropriate. If Congress directs the Commission to impose requirements on market participants, SEC rules will not let you do whatever you want, whenever you want. Some of these rules will impose costs and other compliance burdens that some people may find irritating, and the Commission will use its enforcement tools to pursue violations when necessary. </p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>Fifth, Commission staff is working diligently to process applications for exemption relief, requests for no-action letters, and registration statements, but rising volumes may present challenges. </strong></span>Adherence to technical and legal requirements, sound legal analysis, and thorough and timely responses to staff questions help conserve Commission resources and achieve clearer regulatory goals more quickly and smoothly. As always, such diligence will help applications move more smoothly through the approval process; conversely, a lack of such diligence may result in unnecessary delays. First in does not mean first out. </p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>Sixth, a renewed commitment to a better regulatory environment should not be viewed as an endorsement of any cryptocurrency or token. </strong></span>The Commission does not endorse any product or service, regardless of whether such coin or token is within our jurisdiction; there is no such thing as an SEC stamp of approval. It‚Äôs easy to issue tokens, and if people want to buy a token or product that lacks a clear long-term value proposition, they should be free to do so, but they shouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the price drops one day. In this country, people generally have the right to make their own decisions, but that wonderful American freedom is matched by the equally wonderful American expectation that people must make their own decisions, not expect the government to tell them what to do or not do, or to bail them out if they do something terrible. </p><p>Now, with those rather cursory disclaimers, let‚Äôs talk about the work the Task Force is doing in partnership with staff across the Commission‚Äôs policy divisions. We will be working with the federal government, state securities regulators, and our international counterparts. We invite builders, enthusiasts, and skeptics to join us in exploring what the final rule should be and what interim measures might help foster innovation in the meantime. Commission staff has achieved one milestone‚Äîwithdrawing Staff Accounting Bulletin 121‚Äîbut there is much more work to do. [4] This list is not exhaustive, nor is it presented in order of priority or expected completion. </p><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\"><li><p><strong>Security Status:</strong>The status of crypto-assets under the securities laws is fundamental to addressing many other issues. <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>The Working Group is working to examine different types of crypto-assets. </strong></span></p></li><li><p><strong>Scooping:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>The Working Group will work to help identify some areas that fall outside the Commission‚Äôs jurisdiction. </strong></span>As a first step, the staff welcomes requests for no-action letters. No-action letters typically take the form of a staff statement in which the staff does not recommend an enforcement action to the Commission in response to the specific circumstances articulated in the letter. The statement addresses the specific situation but provides the public at large with a useful window into the staff‚Äôs thinking. </p></li><li><p><strong>Tokens and Token Offerings:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>The Working Group is also considering the possibility of recommending that the Commission take action to provide temporary prospective and retroactive relief for tokens or token offerings where the issuing entity or other entity willing to assume responsibility provides certain specific information, keeps that information current, and agrees not to contest the Commission‚Äôs jurisdiction in the event of a case involving allegations of fraud related to the purchase and sale of assets.</strong></span>These tokens would be deemed non-securities, so there would be no uncertainty as to whether they would be able to trade freely on secondary markets that are not registered with the SEC, as long as information is kept current and accurate. This approach would bridge the gap until more permanent rules or legislation are finalized. It would provide a path for existing tokens to move out of the fog of uncertainty that obscures a viable path forward and encourage greater disclosure. </p></li><li><p><strong>Registered Offerings:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>The Working Group will consider working with staff to recommend that the Commission modify existing registration pathways, including Regulation A and crowdfunding, so that there is a viable path for those interested in registering token offerings.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><strong>Special Purpose Broker-Dealers:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>The Working Group will explore possible updates to the no-action statement for special purpose broker-dealers, which has not been successful in its current form.</strong></span>An initial change we may recommend is to expand the statement to cover broker-dealers that custody crypto-asset securities as well as non-security crypto-assets. We will work with the public to identify additional barriers to registration. </p></li><li><p><strong>Custody Solutions for Investment Advisers:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>We will work with investment advisers to provide an appropriate regulatory framework within which advisers can safely, legally, and reliably custody client assets themselves or with third parties.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><strong>Crypto Lending and Staking:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>We need clarity on whether cryptocurrency lending and staking programs are subject to the securities laws, and if so, how. We plan to work to help address how to bring such programs into compliance with the law.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><strong>Crypto Exchange-Traded Products:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>The Commission has received a proposed rule change from an SRO to list new types of cryptocurrency exchange-traded products. </strong></span>The Working Group will work with staff to provide clear statements on the approach used in approving or denying these applications. The Working Group will also assist staff and the Commission in considering requests to modify certain features of existing exchange-traded products, including allowing for collateralization and physical creation and redemption. However, the Commission may have to make progress on custody and other issues before these changes can be implemented. </p></li><li><p><strong>Clearing Agencies and Transfer Agents:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>The Working Group also plans to examine the intersection of cryptocurrencies with the rules governing clearing agencies and transfer agents.</strong></span>We will continue to work with market participants who are interested in tokenizing securities or otherwise using blockchain technology to modernize traditional financial markets.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cross-border Sandboxes:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>Many cryptocurrency projects are international in nature. </strong></span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 112, 192);\"><strong>The Working Group is considering how to facilitate cross-border experimentation on a limited scale and temporary timeframe, and potentially on a more permanent, long-term approach. </strong></span></p></li></ol><p>This brief overview of how the Working Group sees the journey ahead is not exhaustive or definitive, but I hope it will be of interest to you. While there are many obstacles to ultimately developing sensible, clear rules, the journey will be exciting and rewarding if we work together. This is the beginning of a conversation‚Äîone we don‚Äôt want to have just with ourselves. </p><p><strong>Citations</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">[1] Press release, ‚ÄúSEC Crypto 2.0: Acting Chairman Uyeda Announces New Crypto Working Group,‚Äù January 21, 2025, https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025-30.

The real focus is: which Web3 track can seize the dividends of AI the fastest, and how to maximize the use of AI to achieve breakthroughs - decentralized finance (DeFi) is undoubtedly one of the most promising areas, and the intersection of the two - <strong>DeFAI (DeFi+AI), is becoming one of the fastest growing tracks in the crypto economy. </strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The essence of DeFAI is to make AI the \"autopilot\" of the on-chain world. The complexity of DeFi has always been the entry barrier for ordinary users, and DeFAI is expected to simplify the user experience through AI and attract more mainstream users: they can <strong>parse on-chain data in real time, and can also help you complete complex strategies such as cross-chain arbitrage, dynamic staking, and flash loan combinations</strong>, and even participate in protocol upgrades through DAO governance. Just like search engines allow ordinary people to surf the Internet without understanding the TCP protocol, DeFAI will allow every novice user to have hedge fund-level asset management capabilities.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Currently, some DeFAI projects have emerged. The author of this article, Daniele, is the founder of DeFAI's head project Hey Anon ($ANON). As a well-known DeFi developer, he has led the development of algorithmic stablecoin Wonderland, decentralized lending AbracadabraMoney, and DEX WAGMI. Today, Hey Anon, the company he founded, focuses on AI-driven DeFi automation tools. Its TypeScript-based solutions are designed to be integrated into DeFi protocols, enabling agents to manage on-chain interactions with unprecedented security and simplicity. Its market value ranks third in the CoinmarketCap DeFAI sector. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Daniele was inspired by DeepseekR1's breakthrough in open source AI reasoning and explored in depth how DeFi can benefit from AI technology. I believe everyone will be able to gain some new insights from his insights. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The following is the main text: </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Artificial intelligence is accelerating. Large language models (LLMs) are empowering everything from conversational assistants to DeFi multi-step transaction automation. However, the cost and complexity of deploying these models at scale remain major obstacles.

By providing powerful reasoning capabilities at low cost, it paves the way for widespread adoption from small development teams to large enterprises. While the Jevons Paradox suggests that infrastructure costs may rise due to surging demand, this phenomenon is ultimately good for the AI ‚Äã‚Äãecosystem‚Äîdriving hardware innovation, community contributions, and advanced application development. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">For DeFAI, AI agents coordinating financial operations on decentralized networks will have a significant ripple effect. Lower costs mean more complex agents, greater accessibility, and an expanding array of on-chain strategies. From yield aggregators to risk management, these advanced AI solutions can operate sustainably, opening up new paths for crypto adoption and innovation. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Deepseek R1 demonstrates how open source advances can catalyze entire industries‚Äîboth AI and DeFi. We stand on the threshold of a future where AI is no longer a tool for the privileged few, but will become a foundational element of everyday finance, creativity, and global decision-making‚Äîdriven by open models, economical infrastructure, and unstoppable community momentum. </p></div></div>",

Henry &amp; Partners' \"2024 Private Wealth Migration Report\" shows that South Korea ranks first in Asia's high-net-worth immigration. Economic, social and cultural factors have driven this immigration wave. Although not directly associated with the Web3 industry, these groups of people often act like canaries in a coal mine, foreshadowing changes in a country's business environment. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Against this backdrop, it is crucial to revisit South Korea's Web3 industry. This report explores the flow of capital, companies, and talent in South Korea's Web3 market, as well as the key challenges the industry must address. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">2. Capital Outflow: Offshore Exchanges and Accelerated On-Chain Transfers</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">South Korea's cryptocurrency market has grown rapidly. There are 15.6 million cryptocurrency investors holding $73 billion in assets. The average daily trading volume of cryptocurrency exchanges is now comparable to the combined trading volume of the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) and the Korea Stock Exchange (KOSDAQ). This reflects the enthusiasm of South Korean investors for crypto assets, driven by low stock market returns and political instability associated with martial law. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" data-href=\"\" src=\"https://image.blockbeats.cn/file_v6/20250126/90b9808a-3ea8-410b-8cdc-f2a269a8b8c9.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_50/format,webp\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">However, the outflow of crypto assets has reached a worrying level recently. During the martial law, service disruptions at major local exchanges undermined people's trust in the stability of these platforms. At the same time, diversified investment opportunities offered by foreign exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) further promoted capital migration.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Financial Services Commission of South Korea's Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) Survey in the first half of 2024 showed that fund transfers to out-of-town VASP wallets increased 2.3 times year-on-year. On-chain data confirms this trend, indicating that the migration of assets from local exchanges to foreign platforms continues to increase. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the long run, capital migration may harm South Korea's Web3 industry. Transaction fees and service revenue flow abroad, weakening the competitiveness of the local ecosystem and reducing investor protection. This also raises concerns about the decline in demand for the won and the increase in volatility of its value. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">3. Migration Wave: Moving Headquarters to Crypto-Friendly Countries</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">South Korea's Web3 companies are accelerating offshore migration. In 2024, Nexon's blockchain unit Nexpace and Klaytn and Line Finschia's Kaia Foundation moved to Abu Dhabi. WeMade's Wemix moved to Dubai. The Web3 industry is rapidly moving to countries with clearer and more favorable regulations. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">South Korea faces many obstacles in promoting Web3-related businesses. Companies are unable to open corporate accounts for cryptocurrency transactions, making it difficult to use crypto assets. This brings complexity to the monetization of crypto assets and creates problems in accounting, taxation, and business operations. For example, in the cryptocurrency payment business, Company A may receive crypto assets from consumers and need to settle payments with sellers in Korean won. Without a corporate account, monetizing assets is almost impossible. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Although South Korea has established a regulatory framework, the lack of specific guidelines for stablecoins, DeFi, and Web3 games has limited industry growth. The country's proactive regulatory approach restricts businesses that are not explicitly licensed. In contrast, the global market has benefited from regulatory sandboxes that support various demonstration projects. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Trump administration's stance on cryptocurrencies may highlight this difference, with a favorable regulatory environment overseas accelerating the migration of Web3 companies from South Korea. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">4. Brain drain: weakening the technological competitiveness of the Web3 industry</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The relocation of South Korean Web3 companies abroad may have a negative impact on the domestic Web3 talent pool. As companies move to countries with clearer and more favorable regulations, domestic job opportunities may decrease, leading to a brain drain. This may hinder the development of the domestic Web3 ecosystem.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The migration of talent is not just a problem for the Web3 industry in South Korea. South Korea has one of the highest rates of migration of key talent to the United States, especially those with master's and doctoral degrees. This trend is particularly evident in the technology-dependent Web3 industry and may harm the competitiveness of the industry.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In contrast, countries such as the United States and the United Arab Emirates promote the development of their Web3 industries through clear regulations and supportive policies. South Korea's unclear regulatory environment has accelerated the brain drain, which poses a long-term threat to South Korea's technological competitiveness and industrial ecosystem. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">5. Challenges and Opportunities of the Korean Web3 Market in 2025: Regulatory Reform and Industry Growth</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">South Korea has received global attention for its cryptocurrency trading volume. However, this trading volume has not promoted industry development and made the country a liquidity channel for global traders. This structure is not conducive to sustainable growth. South Korea urgently needs to make progress in business and technology to strengthen the Web3 ecosystem. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" data-href=\"\" src=\"https://image.blockbeats.cn/file_v6/20250126/d727ff35-0d3b-4c60-9f04-de6986b767fa.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_50/format,webp\"/></p><blockquote style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Source: Arthur Hayes</span></blockquote><p style=\"text-align: left;\">South Korea has been marginalized in the global Web3 development due to insufficient local innovation and regulatory uncertainty. This over-reliance on transaction volume rather than ecosystem building has led to a \"Korea discount\" in the international market.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In 2025, with the new government taking office, major changes are expected to occur in the global industry. South Korea is at a critical crossroads amid these changes. Positive moves include allowing cryptocurrency operators to open corporate accounts, developing stablecoin regulations, and advancing cryptocurrency legislation. However, these efforts are only scratching the surface. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">To make progress, South Korea must address risks, analyze global policy shifts, and develop a regulatory framework tailored to domestic circumstances. South Korea must shift from a singular focus on transaction volume to building a sustainable innovation hub characterized by outstanding business and technological leadership. </p></div></div>",
