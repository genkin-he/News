            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p>Author: danielesesta; Source: Coinspire</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> With the rapid development of AI technology, it is no longer a problem for everyone to believe that Web3 can benefit from AI. The real focus is: which Web3 track can seize the dividends of AI the fastest, and how to maximize the use of AI to achieve breakthroughs - decentralized finance (DeFi) is undoubtedly one of the most promising areas, and the intersection of the two - <strong>DeFAI (DeFi+AI), is becoming one of the fastest growing tracks in the crypto economy. </strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The essence of DeFAI is to make AI the \"autopilot\" of the on-chain world. The complexity of DeFi has always been the entry barrier for ordinary users, and DeFAI is expected to simplify the user experience through AI and attract more mainstream users: they can <strong>parse on-chain data in real time, and can also help you complete complex strategies such as cross-chain arbitrage, dynamic staking, and flash loan combinations</strong>, and even participate in protocol upgrades through DAO governance. Just like search engines allow ordinary people to surf the Internet without understanding the TCP protocol, DeFAI will allow every novice user to have hedge fund-level asset management capabilities.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Currently, some DeFAI projects have emerged. The author of this article, Daniele, is the founder of DeFAI's head project Hey Anon ($ANON). As a well-known DeFi developer, he has led the development of algorithmic stablecoin Wonderland, decentralized lending AbracadabraMoney, and DEX WAGMI. Today, Hey Anon, the company he founded, focuses on AI-driven DeFi automation tools. Its TypeScript-based solutions are designed to be integrated into DeFi protocols, enabling agents to manage on-chain interactions with unprecedented security and simplicity. Its market value ranks third in the CoinmarketCap DeFAI sector. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Daniele was inspired by DeepseekR1's breakthrough in open source AI reasoning and explored in depth how DeFi can benefit from AI technology. I believe everyone will be able to gain some new insights from his insights. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The following is the main text: </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Artificial intelligence is accelerating. Large language models (LLMs) are empowering everything from conversational assistants to DeFi multi-step transaction automation. However, the cost and complexity of deploying these models at scale remain major obstacles. The result is a new open source AI model, Deepseek R1, that delivers powerful inference capabilities at a lower cost—paving the way for millions of new users and application scenarios. </p><blockquote style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>This article will explore:</strong></blockquote><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>▶ Deepseek R1’s breakthrough in open source AI inference</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>▶ How low-cost inference and flexible licensing drive widespread adoption</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>▶ Why Jevons’ paradox suggests that efficiency gains may drive up usage (and costs)—but are still a net positive for AI developers</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>▶ How DeFAI benefits from the proliferation of AI in financial applications</strong></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Deepseek R1: Redefining open source AI</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Deepseek R1 is a new type of open source AI trained on extensive text LLM is optimized for reasoning and contextual understanding. Its outstanding features include: </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>• Efficient Architecture</strong>: Adopting a new generation of parameter structures, it can achieve near-top performance in complex reasoning tasks without the need for large GPU clusters. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>• Low Hardware Requirements</strong>: Designed to run on a small number of GPUs or even high-end CPU clusters, it lowers the barrier to entry for startups, independent developers, and the open source community. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>• Open Source License</strong>: Unlike most proprietary models, its permissive license allows companies to integrate directly into products—driving rapid adoption, plugin development, and professional fine-tuning. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This trend of democratizing AI is reminiscent of the early days of open source projects such as Linux, Apache, and MySQL—which ultimately drove the exponential growth of the technology ecosystem. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Value Proposition of Low-Cost AI</h2><ul class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Accelerate Adoption</strong></p></li></ul><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>• SMEs</strong>: Deploy AI solutions without relying on expensive proprietary services. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>• Developers</strong>: Free to experiment—from chatbots to automated research assistants, innovate and iterate on a budget. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>• Geographic Diversification</strong>: Emerging market companies can seamlessly access AI solutions to bridge the digital divide in industries such as finance, healthcare, and education. </p><ul class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Democratization of Reasoning</strong></p></li></ul><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Low-cost reasoning not only drives adoption, but also democratizes reasoning:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>• Localized models</strong>: Small communities can train Deepseek R1 with language-specific or domain-specific corpora (e.g., professional medical/legal data).</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>• Modular extensibility</strong>: Developers and independent researchers can build advanced plugins (e.g., code analysis, supply chain optimization, on-chain transaction verification) to break through licensing bottlenecks.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Overall, cost savings enable more experiments, accelerating overall innovation in the AI ​​ecosystem. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Jevons Paradox: Why Efficiency Improvement Drives Up Consumption</h2><ul class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>What is the Jevons Paradox?</strong></p></li></ul><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This theory states that efficiency improvements often lead to increased rather than reduced resource consumption. Initially discovered in the context of coal use, it means that when a process becomes more economical, people tend to expand its scale of use, offsetting (and sometimes exceeding) efficiency gains.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the context of Deepseek R1:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>• Low-cost model</strong>: Reduce hardware requirements, making AI more economical to run.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>• Result</strong>: More companies, researchers, and enthusiasts launch AI instances. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>• Effect</strong>: Although the cost of operating a single instance has decreased, the surge in total volume may push up overall computing power consumption (and costs). </p><ul class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Is this a negative? </strong></p></li></ul><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Not necessarily. The widespread use of models such as Deepseek R1 signals a surge in successful adoption and applications, which will drive: </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>• Ecosystem prosperity</strong>: More developers improve open source code functions, fix vulnerabilities, and optimize performance. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>• Hardware innovation</strong>: GPU, CPU, and dedicated AI chip manufacturers respond to surging demand and compete on price and energy efficiency. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>• Business Opportunities</strong>: Builders of analytical tools, process orchestration, specialized data pre-processing, and more will benefit from the surge in AI adoption.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Thus, while the Jevons Paradox suggests that infrastructure costs may rise, it is a positive signal for the AI ​​industry as a whole—promoting an innovative environment that can lead to economic deployment breakthroughs (such as advanced compression techniques or task offloading to specialized chips).</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Impact on DeFAI</h2><ul class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>DeFAI: When AI Meets DeFi</strong></p></li></ul><p style=\"text-align: left;\">DeFAI combines decentralized finance with AI automation, enabling agents to manage on-chain assets, perform multi-step transactions, and interact with DeFi protocols. This emerging space directly benefits from open-source, low-cost AI because:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>• 24/7 autonomy</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Agents can continuously scan DeFi markets, bridge assets between chains, and adjust positions. Low inference costs make 24/7 operations financially viable.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>• Infinitely scalable</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">When thousands of DeFAI agents need to serve different users or protocols simultaneously, low-cost models such as Deepseek R1 can control operating expenses.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>• Customization</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Developers can fine-tune open-source AI with DeFi-specific data (price feeds, on-chain analytics, governance forums) without paying high licensing fees. </p><ul class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>More AI agents, stronger financial automation</strong></p></li></ul><p style=\"text-align: left;\">With Deepseek R1 lowering the AI ​​threshold, DeFAI forms a positive cycle:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>• Agent explosion</strong>: Developers create professional robots (such as yield hunting, liquidity provision, NFT trading, cross-chain arbitrage)</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>• Efficiency improvement</strong>: Each agent optimizes the flow of funds, which may increase the overall activity and liquidity of DeFi</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>• Industry growth</strong>: More complex DeFi products emerge, from advanced derivatives to conditional payments, all coordinated by easily accessible AI</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The final result --- the entire The DeFAI field benefits from the virtuous cycle of <strong>\"user growth - agent evolution\"</strong>. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Outlook: Positive signals for AI developers</h2><ul class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>A thriving open source community</strong></p></li></ul><p style=\"text-align: left;\">After Deepseek R1 is open sourced, the community can:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">• Quickly fix vulnerabilities</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">• Propose inference optimization solutions</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">• Create field forks (such as finance, law, and healthcare)</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Collaborative development brings continuous model improvements and gives birth to ecological tools (fine-tuning frameworks, model service infrastructure, etc.)</p><ul class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>New profit paths</strong></p></li></ul><p style=\"text-align: left;\">AI developers in areas such as DeFAI can break through the traditional API call charging model:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>• Hosted AI instances</strong>: Provide enterprise-level Deepseek R1 hosting services with a friendly dashboard</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>• Service layer construction</strong>: Based on the open source model, integrate advanced functions such as compliance review and real-time intelligence for DeFi operators</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>• Agent marketplace</strong>: Host agent profiles with unique strategies or risk configurations, and provide subscription or performance sharing services</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">When the underlying AI technology can scale to millions of concurrent users without bankrupting the supplier, this business model will flourish</p><ul class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Low barriers = expanded talent pool</strong></p></li></ul><p style=\"text-align: left;\">With the reduced demand for Deepseek R1, more developers around the world can participate in AI experiments. This influx of talent:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">• Inspires innovative solutions to real-world and cryptographic problems;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">• Enriches the open source community with fresh ideas and improvements;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">• Releases global talent that was once shut out by high computing costs.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Conclusion</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The emergence of Deepseek R1 marks a key turning point: open source AI no longer requires expensive computing power or licensing fees. By providing powerful reasoning capabilities at low cost, it paves the way for widespread adoption from small development teams to large enterprises. While the Jevons Paradox suggests that infrastructure costs may rise due to surging demand, this phenomenon is ultimately good for the AI ​​ecosystem—driving hardware innovation, community contributions, and advanced application development. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">For DeFAI, AI agents coordinating financial operations on decentralized networks will have a significant ripple effect. Lower costs mean more complex agents, greater accessibility, and an expanding array of on-chain strategies. From yield aggregators to risk management, these advanced AI solutions can operate sustainably, opening up new paths for crypto adoption and innovation. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Deepseek R1 demonstrates how open source advances can catalyze entire industries—both AI and DeFi. We stand on the threshold of a future where AI is no longer a tool for the privileged few, but will become a foundational element of everyday finance, creativity, and global decision-making—driven by open models, economical infrastructure, and unstoppable community momentum. </p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Author: Jay Jo, Yoon Lee, Tiger Research; Translator: Luffy, Foresight News</span><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Key Points</strong></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>·  </strong>South Korea’s high cryptocurrency trading volume has attracted global attention, but unclear regulations and a lack of guidelines have hampered the industry’s development.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>·  </strong>The government prohibits the opening of real-name accounts for cryptocurrency trading for businesses. This restriction, coupled with an ambiguous regulatory framework, has led to an outflow of talent, capital, and businesses, weakening the competitiveness of the Web3 ecosystem.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>·  </strong>As the global Web3 industry is expected to develop rapidly under the Trump administration, South Korea must reform its regulatory policies to ensure the long-term sustainability of the industry. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">1. Introduction</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The inauguration of \"crypto-friendly president\" Trump and the establishment of the Crypto 2.0 TF of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will accelerate the structural changes in the global Web3 market. This is a critical turning point. Talent, capital, and enterprises may migrate to countries with sound regulatory frameworks, while the outflow from countries with regulatory uncertainty will intensify. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" data-href=\"\" src=\"https://image.blockbeats.cn/file_v6/20250126/963c5cd9-e47e-46f0-a8cd-acda3864a9f8.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_50/format,webp\"/></p><blockquote style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">2024 Capital Inflow/Outflow by Country, Data Source: Henry &amp; Partners</span></blockquote><p style=\"text-align: left;\">South Korea is also in this trend. Henry &amp; Partners' \"2024 Private Wealth Migration Report\" shows that South Korea ranks first in Asia's high-net-worth immigration. Economic, social and cultural factors have driven this immigration wave. Although not directly associated with the Web3 industry, these groups of people often act like canaries in a coal mine, foreshadowing changes in a country's business environment. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Against this backdrop, it is crucial to revisit South Korea's Web3 industry. This report explores the flow of capital, companies, and talent in South Korea's Web3 market, as well as the key challenges the industry must address. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">2. Capital Outflow: Offshore Exchanges and Accelerated On-Chain Transfers</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">South Korea's cryptocurrency market has grown rapidly. There are 15.6 million cryptocurrency investors holding $73 billion in assets. The average daily trading volume of cryptocurrency exchanges is now comparable to the combined trading volume of the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) and the Korea Stock Exchange (KOSDAQ). This reflects the enthusiasm of South Korean investors for crypto assets, driven by low stock market returns and political instability associated with martial law. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" data-href=\"\" src=\"https://image.blockbeats.cn/file_v6/20250126/90b9808a-3ea8-410b-8cdc-f2a269a8b8c9.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_50/format,webp\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">However, the outflow of crypto assets has reached a worrying level recently. During the martial law, service disruptions at major local exchanges undermined people's trust in the stability of these platforms. At the same time, diversified investment opportunities offered by foreign exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) further promoted capital migration.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Financial Services Commission of South Korea's Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) Survey in the first half of 2024 showed that fund transfers to out-of-town VASP wallets increased 2.3 times year-on-year. On-chain data confirms this trend, indicating that the migration of assets from local exchanges to foreign platforms continues to increase. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the long run, capital migration may harm South Korea's Web3 industry. Transaction fees and service revenue flow abroad, weakening the competitiveness of the local ecosystem and reducing investor protection. This also raises concerns about the decline in demand for the won and the increase in volatility of its value. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">3. Migration Wave: Moving Headquarters to Crypto-Friendly Countries</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">South Korea's Web3 companies are accelerating offshore migration. In 2024, Nexon's blockchain unit Nexpace and Klaytn and Line Finschia's Kaia Foundation moved to Abu Dhabi. WeMade's Wemix moved to Dubai. The Web3 industry is rapidly moving to countries with clearer and more favorable regulations. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">South Korea faces many obstacles in promoting Web3-related businesses. Companies are unable to open corporate accounts for cryptocurrency transactions, making it difficult to use crypto assets. This brings complexity to the monetization of crypto assets and creates problems in accounting, taxation, and business operations. For example, in the cryptocurrency payment business, Company A may receive crypto assets from consumers and need to settle payments with sellers in Korean won. Without a corporate account, monetizing assets is almost impossible. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Although South Korea has established a regulatory framework, the lack of specific guidelines for stablecoins, DeFi, and Web3 games has limited industry growth. The country's proactive regulatory approach restricts businesses that are not explicitly licensed. In contrast, the global market has benefited from regulatory sandboxes that support various demonstration projects. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Trump administration's stance on cryptocurrencies may highlight this difference, with a favorable regulatory environment overseas accelerating the migration of Web3 companies from South Korea. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">4. Brain drain: weakening the technological competitiveness of the Web3 industry</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The relocation of South Korean Web3 companies abroad may have a negative impact on the domestic Web3 talent pool. As companies move to countries with clearer and more favorable regulations, domestic job opportunities may decrease, leading to a brain drain. This may hinder the development of the domestic Web3 ecosystem.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The migration of talent is not just a problem for the Web3 industry in South Korea. South Korea has one of the highest rates of migration of key talent to the United States, especially those with master's and doctoral degrees. This trend is particularly evident in the technology-dependent Web3 industry and may harm the competitiveness of the industry.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In contrast, countries such as the United States and the United Arab Emirates promote the development of their Web3 industries through clear regulations and supportive policies. South Korea's unclear regulatory environment has accelerated the brain drain, which poses a long-term threat to South Korea's technological competitiveness and industrial ecosystem. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">5. Challenges and Opportunities of the Korean Web3 Market in 2025: Regulatory Reform and Industry Growth</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">South Korea has received global attention for its cryptocurrency trading volume. However, this trading volume has not promoted industry development and made the country a liquidity channel for global traders. This structure is not conducive to sustainable growth. South Korea urgently needs to make progress in business and technology to strengthen the Web3 ecosystem. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" data-href=\"\" src=\"https://image.blockbeats.cn/file_v6/20250126/d727ff35-0d3b-4c60-9f04-de6986b767fa.png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_50/format,webp\"/></p><blockquote style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Source: Arthur Hayes</span></blockquote><p style=\"text-align: left;\">South Korea has been marginalized in the global Web3 development due to insufficient local innovation and regulatory uncertainty. This over-reliance on transaction volume rather than ecosystem building has led to a \"Korea discount\" in the international market.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In 2025, with the new government taking office, major changes are expected to occur in the global industry. South Korea is at a critical crossroads amid these changes. Positive moves include allowing cryptocurrency operators to open corporate accounts, developing stablecoin regulations, and advancing cryptocurrency legislation. However, these efforts are only scratching the surface. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">To make progress, South Korea must address risks, analyze global policy shifts, and develop a regulatory framework tailored to domestic circumstances. South Korea must shift from a singular focus on transaction volume to building a sustainable innovation hub characterized by outstanding business and technological leadership. </p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">On February 3, the crypto market experienced a waterfall-like decline. Bitcoin once plunged to $91,000, and Ethereum plunged to below $2,100, reaching its lowest level since November. Other altcoins fell even more severely, with an average drop of more than 15%. Just as investors were panicking, funds flowed back during the North American trading session, and the market rebounded in a V-shaped manner. In the early hours of this morning, Bitcoin once hit $102,500, completely recovering yesterday's losses.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Before and after the Spring Festival holiday, Bitcoin has experienced short-term sharp declines many times. But it is worth noting that despite the large decline, Bitcoin has been quickly repaired every time, showing amazing market resilience. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc9FY5xMDwdsVqY661xUiULiB-WDM2takXPp9iJFf5ZF2qA3_aTV4sEZjfjei2Ux0OYui_XE8no7MmftNymeWoT-9kqaSl1yzazPPlGCLorAzyhVP2o1-DPV2BucILw_T7-kWQsqA?key=LrsLQvQP2GZON5t5x7VEGgWz\"/></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">DeepSeek has hit the market hard</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">On the eve of the Lunar New Year, the download volume of the domestic AI large model DeepSeek surpassed ChatGPT and topped the US APP Store, attracting the attention and coverage of the global technology, investment industry and media. Because the model is extremely low-cost, but its effect is comparable to that of AI products of American companies such as OpenAI, it has brought great shock to the global market, shaking the foundation of the AI ​​industry that has always believed that \"great effort can produce miracles\". A stone stirs up a thousand waves, and US technology stocks are immediately hit hard. Nvidia's stock price once fell by nearly 17%. The crypto market was also not immune to the impact. Bitcoin and Ethereum also fell by 6% and 7% respectively, and some altcoins lost double digits. However, after the plunge, the market rebounded quickly, and mainstream currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum quickly recovered their losses, showing strong market bullish confidence. Trump's tariff policy caused market panic. During the Spring Festival, the tariff stick promised by Trump during his campaign for the US presidency has gradually been implemented in recent days. On February 2, US President Trump signed an order to impose a 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian imports and a 10% tariff on China. The trade volume between the United States and these three countries is about 1.6 trillion US dollars. The relevant countries have also vowed to take retaliatory actions. The official start of the tariff war has shocked the global financial market.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The market is worried that a full-scale trade war will disrupt the global supply chain, raise inflation, cause the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again, and drag down the economy. Cryptocurrencies have fallen like waterfalls. Bitcoin once plunged to $91,000, Ethereum plunged to below $2,100, and many altcoins hit an all-time low.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">After the great turmoil in the global financial market, Trump said on Monday that after talking with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, he agreed to postpone the plan to impose a 25% tariff on the two neighboring countries for one month and continue negotiations. Market sentiment eased, and the crypto market rebounded in a V-shaped pattern. Bitcoin once reached $102,500, completely recovering yesterday's losses. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Is the bull market still on the way? </h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">During this period, Bitcoin has experienced sharp declines many times. Although each decline can be quickly repaired, these fluctuations are also constantly shaking investors' confidence, making market sentiment increasingly weak, triggering a debate on whether the bull market is still there. Overall, this round of bull market is still sustainable, mainly based on the following points:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">1. Tariff policy may only be a negotiating tool. During Trump's first term, tariff policies changed frequently and capriciously, and tariff threats were more of a bargaining chip than a long-term strategy. After Trump announced the imposition of tariffs on Mexico and Canada, the limited decline in technology stocks was a reaction to this. The market believed that Trump's \"false shot\" was intended to allow the Mexican and Canadian governments to crack down on drugs and illegal immigrants entering the United States. Sure enough, the next day, Trump said on social media that Mexico agreed to send 10,000 soldiers to the border to control illegal immigrants and drugs, and Canada would also take corresponding measures. The suspension of the tariff policy once again supported this view. Now it seems that Trump's wishful thinking is going well, and the negotiations with Mexico and Canada have yielded results. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">2. Trump's campaign promises are being fulfilled. Trump's crypto-friendly policies are being promoted and have been partially realized, such as the appointment of cryptocurrency-friendly officials and the issuance of executive orders, and the market's most concerned about the national strategic reserve of Bitcoin has also received further news. On Monday, Trump signed an executive order instructing the Treasury and Commerce Departments to submit a plan for a new U.S. sovereign wealth fund within 90 days and establish the fund within the next 12 months. Although Bitcoin was not explicitly mentioned when it was signed, the fund could become a tool for the government to purchase and hold cryptocurrencies. Cynthia Lummis, who first proposed that the United States establish a strategic reserve of Bitcoin and was appointed by the Trump administration as chairperson of the U.S. Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets, posted on X and used the Bitcoin symbol, implying that it was related to the Bitcoin strategic reserve. 3. Multiple BTC escape indicators did not appear. In every bull market, Bitcoin has shown obvious indicators of escaping the top. None of the 30 indicators currently recognized by the mainstream market, including the rainbow chart, ahr999 and other core indicators, has hit the target. In addition, the tops of all bull markets in history are not flat, but a needle, which does not give retail investors too much time to think. Now Bitcoin has stayed near $100,000 for more than a month, which is usually a sign that the bull market is still continuing. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdwaulWYVC2_QTCGeR6g2Ytmjcib0RUfI3HXJmCH3Bs35axUNgYlvnHUa4LL7A54KpUErWed4h9_3EZMnTnoRQizaDThSp5qDpcV1CSdq99D_1G6Fub_f8SyiWIMyLAb1kuLyRg-Q?key=LrsLQvQP2GZON5t5x7VEGgWz\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">On the whole, although the market volatility in early 2025 is intense, there are many signs that the current bull market still has the possibility of continuing to rise. Investors should remain cautiously optimistic and pay attention to policy changes and market indicators to cope with possible fluctuations and opportunities. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdy4ck2tzvCxzU9C2nu2svz3sEBmNCZMU1T5ObcrSbIzRlvOR8OSynOcQE0m RHUBVEWgXUQ0EV0W9kXy55XaOLoxJLLR4ET4yyFVkVPyUsaCzUKnn7iPcgVMQJql4PyMdnbR7_Ayg?key=LrsLQvQP2GZON5t5x7VEGgWz\"/></p><p ant-image=\"\" image_preview___3r7dm=\"\" style=\"text-align: As the official partner of the Argentine national team, 4E provides trading services covering more than 600 assets including cryptocurrencies, commodities, stocks, indexes, etc. It also supports financial products with an annualized rate of return of up to 5.5%.
