The market's reaction to news can tell investors everything about sentiment. In a bull market trend, the market shrugs off bad news, but rises as soon as good news comes. In a bear market trend, the opposite is true. The market shrugs off good news and falls as soon as bad news comes. It is important to observe early signs of a trend shift, and the market's reaction to news is an easy way to do this.",
