            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News Late Tuesday, XRP Ledger was suspended for more than an hour, sparking a heated debate between critics and supporters of the network. Ripple CTO David Schwartz confirmed that XRPL has resumed operation and user funds have not been lost, but the cause of the problem is still under investigation. Some believe that the network outage of more than 1 hour represents a failure of consensus, exposing the network to a critical coordinated attack vector, and criticized the obvious degree of centralization among a relatively small number of trusted validators. In response, Daniel Keller, CTO of blockchain infrastructure company Eminence, said the suspension was \"as planned\" to ensure the integrity of the ledger. \"Every solution has trade-offs. Suspending until a solution is found is one of them.\" \nThe XRP Ledger's network has a total of more than 200 validators. But the number of validators on the unique node list (UNL) trusted by each node is much smaller, and these validators participate in the consensus process. The unique node list (UNL) recommended by the XRPL Foundation contains at least 35 validators. By comparison, although not directly comparable, there are over 1 million active validators on Ethereum, while Bitcoin’s network has at least 65,000 nodes and thousands of miners worldwide.
