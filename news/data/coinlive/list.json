            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News Venture capital firm a16z issued an article stating that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) should stop holding DeFi protocols accountable for illegal activities that they did not instigate and cannot control.\nThe article pointed out: \"Holding people accountable for systems and activities over which they have no power or control will lead to adverse consequences. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice ignored this distinction and tried to do this by holding software developers accountable for the actions of third parties who use neutral tools that they originally created but no longer control.\"\nThe agency said that the \"biggest policy focus\" of the new U.S. presidential administration on cryptocurrencies should be \"codifying the correct and legal understanding of 'control' in the law.\"\na16z believes that this is particularly important for determining whether a cryptocurrency company qualifies as a \"funds transmission business\" because the business needs to comply with specific rules and obligations.\nAccording to the official website, a16z's venture capital investment portfolio covers more than 100 cryptocurrency companies, including DEXs such as Uniswap.",

            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News: Ethereum co-founder and Polkadot founder Gavin Wood said in an interview with Forbes recently that blockchains that ignore decentralization and resilience should not be considered Web3. Measuring the resilience of a blockchain usually comes down to assessing its degree of decentralization, and Wood identified several questions to assess this metric: Who makes protocol decisions? Does governance have a clear or low entry barrier? And the Nakamoto coefficient, which measures how many parties are needed to destroy the network. Finally, Wood drew attention to more \"diffuse concepts,\" such as whether a single entity can define a narrative and \"fundamentally transcend the ecosystem and stifle other narratives.\" He is satisfied with Polkadot's decentralization. According to Nakaflow data, Polkadot's current Nakamoto coefficient is 149, which means that at least 149 independent validators are required to unite to destroy the network. In comparison, some other major blockchains have much lower scores, such as Solana's score of 19 and Ethereum's score of only 2. However, for Polkadot, the high barrier to entry is still a problem. In addition, Wood also proposed the following five basic criteria for judging the potential of blockchain: \n1. Resilience: The cornerstone of Web3, resilience combines cryptography, decentralization and game theory to protect blockchain from attacks and ensure its long-term stability; \n2. Performance: Not only scalability, performance also measures the efficiency of a network in processing and completing tasks; \n3. Generality: The ability of blockchain to support multiple applications and programmability; \n4. Accessibility: The ease with which users, developers, applications and robots interact with the network; \n5. Coherence: The ability of a system to maintain fast and consistent communication in its network.",

Although the price of Bitcoin has remained above $100,000, the RSI has been in a consolidation state, indicating that the momentum of the underlying trend is weakening.\nLooking back at the correction and consolidation phases before 2024, strong buying opportunities have historically only occurred when the RSI fell to about 40%. At present, although the RSI is close to that level (48%), it has not yet reached it, so it may be too early to enter a new long position. A more strategic approach is to remain patient and wait for the best entry point.",

            "description": "According to Cointelegraph, El Salvador has increased its Bitcoin reserves by purchasing 12 Bitcoin during a recent market downturn. On February 4, the country acquired 11 Bitcoin for just over $1.1 million, averaging $101,816 per Bitcoin. An additional Bitcoin was later bought for $99,114, as reported by the government's Bitcoin Office tracker. This acquisition brings El Salvador's total Bitcoin holdings to 6,068 BTC, valued at over $554 million.\n\nThe Bitcoin Office announced in a February 4 post on X that El Salvador had accumulated 21 BTC over the week, with a total of 60 BTC purchased in the past 30 days. The post highlighted the growth of the world's first Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, emphasizing El Salvador's continued success in expanding its cryptocurrency assets.\n\nBitcoin experienced a 24-hour low of approximately $96,000 but has since recovered to around $98,000, though it remains below its intraday high of over $100,700, according to CoinGecko data. The recent Bitcoin purchases follow a $1.4 billion financing agreement between El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last month. As part of the agreement, the government agreed to reduce some of its Bitcoin-related activities.\n\nChanges implemented by El Salvador include making Bitcoin acceptance voluntary for the private sector and reducing government involvement in the Chivo crypto wallet. On January 29, Reuters reported that El Salvador's Congress quickly approved legislation to amend its Bitcoin laws to align with the IMF deal, which President Bukele had submitted shortly before.\n\nDespite the IMF agreement, El Salvador's government continues to invest in Bitcoin. The day after the deal was made, the country purchased $1 million worth of Bitcoin. National Bitcoin Office Director Stacy Herbert stated in late December that the country's Bitcoin strategy remains unchanged. A spokesperson from the Bitcoin Office also confirmed to Cointelegraph that El Salvador plans to continue buying Bitcoin, with intentions to \"intensify in 2025.\"",
