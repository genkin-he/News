            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News The U.S. Treasury Department said that Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) personnel assigned to the agency had \"read-only\" access to its sensitive $5 trillion payment system, and that no payments had been suspended or rejected as part of the ongoing review.\nTreasury officials provided this information in a letter to lawmakers, which is the first time to substantively detail the role of the Department of Government Efficiency staff assigned to the agency in the operations of the Bureau of Fiscal Services.\nAn unnamed official said in the letter late Tuesday: \"The ongoing review of the Treasury system will not result in the suspension or rejection of any payment instructions submitted to the Treasury by other federal agencies of the government. In particular, the review of the Bureau of Fiscal Services has not resulted in the delay or change of payments for obligations such as Social Security and Medicare.\"\nThe letter marks the first time that the Treasury Department has publicly acknowledged and explained the position held by Tom Krause, CEO of Cloud Software Group, who has ties to DOGE. In recent weeks, Krause has been described as a central staff member with ties to DOGE, pushing efforts to ensure access to payment systems, and ultimately obtaining access granted by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\nThe letter states that Krause is now a Treasury employee with \"read-only access to the Fiscal Service Payment System's coded data to continue this operational efficiency assessment.\" (CNN)",

Sacks met with several Republican legislators, including Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott, Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman, House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill, and House Agriculture Committee Chairman Glenn Thompson.\n\nPreviously, Sacks had indicated that the feasibility of Bitcoin reserves was under study, but he could not comment on whether sovereign wealth funds should hold cryptocurrencies.",
