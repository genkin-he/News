            "description": "According to BlockBeats, on February 5, QCP Capital released its latest analysis highlighting ongoing volatility in traditional financial markets amid developments in U.S. trade policy and high-risk tariff conflicts. The S&P 500 index struggles to maintain the 6000-point level, with last week's fluctuations leading to a pullback in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin briefly reached $92,000, while Ethereum fell to $2,100. Although the U.S. has delayed imposing tariffs on Mexico and Canada, the U.S.-China trade war remains a central concern for the market.\n\nIn terms of cryptocurrency regulation, authorities have established a dedicated task force to draft stablecoin regulations and assess the feasibility of Strategic Bitcoin Reserves (SBR). QCP Capital suggests that while Bitcoin's ability to stay above $90,000 demonstrates resilience, the presence of geopolitical risks and a lack of short-term positive catalysts warrant a defensive investment strategy.",
