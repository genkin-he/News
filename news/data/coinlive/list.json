FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill stated that institutions previously interested in engaging in crypto or blockchain activities faced significant resistance. This included repeated requests for additional information, prolonged periods of silence, and directives from regulators to pause or cease expansion of all crypto or blockchain activities. These actions conveyed to banks that proceeding would be extremely challenging, if not impossible, leading most banks to abandon their efforts. Looking ahead, the FDIC is actively reassessing its approach to supervising crypto-related activities and anticipates collaborating with the Digital Asset Market Working Group, established by an executive order on January 23, 2025.",

However, there are currently more than 2.6 million BTC in a loss, and the longer the price remains below the average withdrawal level in 2025, the greater the possibility of further decline.
