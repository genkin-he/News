            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News: US President Trump recently invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose comprehensive tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, sparking market concerns about the dominance of the US dollar. This move not only affects the global trade pattern, but may also prompt more investors to turn to Bitcoin as a safe haven. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, pointed out that the unconventional use of IEEPA may accelerate global de-dollarization and drive capital flows to decentralized assets such as Bitcoin to hedge against economic instability. Crypto derivatives trader Gordon Grant also believes that the frequent use of IEEPA may weaken the credit of the US dollar and make digital assets such as Bitcoin more attractive. (TheBlock)",
