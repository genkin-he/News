Although WazirX claims that creditors can recover up to 80% of their balances through its new DEX and recovery token model, its proposed recovery plan has sparked controversy.\nMany users remain skeptical, and some critics believe that the five-year delay is a strategic means to force creditors to accept a new platform rather than a real recovery move.",

            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News H.C. Wainwright analysts said that as Bitcoin breaks through $100,000 for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2024, the profits earned by miners will increase significantly.\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $16.7 billion in inflows during the quarter, almost four times the $4.3 billion in the third quarter, pushing the average BTC price to $83,432 during the quarter, up 36.7% from the previous quarter.\nAnalysts expect these trends to drive strong revenue growth and improved profit margins in mining companies' upcoming earnings reports. The mining industry expanded significantly, with listed miners increasing their operations by 46 EH/s, bringing total deployed capacity to 235.8 EH/s. The global network hash rate averaged 738 EH/s in the fourth quarter, up 17.3% from the third quarter. As of the beginning of the first quarter of 2025, the hash rate continues to climb, reaching 833 EH/s on February 2.\nRising BTC prices and increased mining activity pushed total BTC production up 16.4% month-on-month to 11,366 BTC, while transaction fees surged 59.4% to 1,553 BTC. This pushed total miner revenue up 41% to $3.7 billion. The total market capitalization of listed mining companies increased by 21% to US$28 billion, with AI-related mining companies outperforming their peers.\nLooking ahead, Q1 2025 is off to a strong start, with average BTC prices approaching $100,000 and ETF inflows reaching $5.7 billion. However, analysts warned that markets could be volatile due to ongoing trade tensions between the United States and Canada, Mexico and China. Despite short-term uncertainty, they see any weak nodes in BTC or mining as buying opportunities. (crypto.news)",
