            "description": "Ethereum saw some huge selling in the early trading hours of Monday as it dipped below the $2.1K mark â€“ a 25% dip from its opening price that day. This fall was a result of whale wallets liquidating their positions in $ETH. For instance, two dormant wallets sent $149M and $201M worth of $ETH to Bitfinex. These wallets were last active in 2019 when a withdrawal of 77,736 $ETH was made.

            "description": "According to Cointelegraph, decentralized liquidity protocol THORChain has taken significant steps to address its liquidity issues by converting its defaulted debt into equity. On January 23, THORChain halted its lending and savers programs for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to avert an insolvency crisis and restructure its debt. The platform paused ThorFi redemptions for 90 days, allowing the community to devise a stabilization plan.\n\nFollowing this suspension, the THORChain community proposed various restructuring plans to ensure the network's continued operation while compensating affected users. On February 2, the platform's node operators approved a proposal to convert its defaulted debt into tokens representing equity in the platform. This plan involves minting 200 million 'TCY' tokens and distributing them to affected users, with each token representing $1 of the platform's debt. The new token will receive 10% of the network's revenue indefinitely, providing users with the opportunity to claim one TCY per dollar owed. Maya Protocol's Aaluxx Myth, the pseudonymous author of the proposal, explained that TCY holders would receive 10% of fees in perpetuity, paid out in RUNE every 24 hours, similar to $MAYA, offering uncapped upside potential for new liquidity to bail out users. Risk-averse users can sell the RUNE to any asset of their choosing daily.\n\nAdditionally, the THORChain treasury plans to create a liquidity pool, allowing tokenholders to sell their claims at their discretion. The platform stated that this plan enables creditors to exit on their own terms as market demand for THORChain's revenue materializes in the token's price. While the protocol has established its plan, it is still finalizing the timeline and specifics.\n\nDespite the restructuring plan's intentions to repay investors, some community members have expressed concerns. One community member commented on X that the plan is complex and would require additional investment and trust in THORChain, which has a history of mismanaging money and trust. The user noted that new capital entering is 'permanently taxed' under the plan. Furthermore, the issuance of a new token granting holders 10% of the platform's revenue has raised questions about whether it qualifies as an unregistered security, potentially leading to legal action against THORChain. Another community member expressed skepticism about the tokens receiving revenue indefinitely, suggesting it might only last until the platform changes its policy. Cointelegraph reached out to THORChain for comment but had not received a response by the time of publication.",

            "description": "According to CoinDesk, the outlook for alternative cryptocurrencies remains uncertain compared to bitcoin, as the possibility of a renewed trade war between the United States and its major trading partners looms, potentially destabilizing the global economy. Despite this, some cryptocurrencies are showing promising signs of growth.\n\nOne such example is the XRP/BTC ratio, which is indicating a potential bullish trend. For the first time since 2017, the ratio is approaching a move above the upper Bollinger band on the monthly chart. This development suggests a possible significant bull run for XRP. Bollinger bands are volatility indicators that are set two standard deviations above and below a 20-period simple moving average of an asset's price. A break above the upper band typically signals a bullish market imbalance, with prices often maintaining upward momentum for several days.\n\nTraders who analyze price patterns often enter long positions when prices surpass the upper band, interpreting it as a sign of bullish market conditions. Breakouts that occur after extended periods of consolidation between the bands are generally considered more reliable. Notably, the XRP/BTC ratio experienced a nearly 200% surge following a Bollinger band breakout in April 2017, which resolved a period of low volatility trading with a bullish outcome. Observers are now watching to see if history will repeat itself in the current market climate.",

            "description": "According to CoinDesk, Howard Lutnick, chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald and U.S. President Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. Commerce Secretary, recently faced intense questioning from Senate Democrats regarding Cantor Fitzgerald's involvement with Tether, the issuer of the world's largest stablecoin, USDT. Lutnick appeared before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on January 29, following his testimony at the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald acts as Tether's primary custodian for U.S. Treasuries, managing a substantial portion of its reserves and holding convertible debt issued by Tether's parent company. The reserves backing USDT have long been a concern within the crypto industry. In 2023, Lutnick attempted to alleviate these concerns by associating Cantor's reputation with Tether, asserting that as its custodian, he was confident in Tether's financial backing. However, during the hearing, Lutnick appeared to temper his previous statements.\n\nLutnick stated, \"Cantor Fitzgerald is not conducting continuous diligence on Tetherâ€™s financial statements, but I believe my statements were accurate when made,\" retracting his earlier assertion that \"Tether has every penny, and it can produce liquidity on a momentâ€™s notice.\" On Polymarket, bettors currently assign a 10% probability of Tether becoming insolvent in 2025 and a 14% chance of it de-pegging during the year, indicating potential issues at the issuer. A contract regarding insolvency for 2024 averaged around 4% in the last quarter of the year.\n\nLutnick also confirmed that \"Cantor Fitzgerald made a convertible debt investment in the holding company that owns the Tether stablecoin business in April 2024,\" clarifying that this does not imply an ownership stake in the stablecoin issuer. \"Cantor Fitzgeraldâ€™s debt investment in Tether does not constitute an equity interest,\" he stated, dismissing concerns about deeper ties between the brokerage firm and Tether.\n\nCritics of Tether often call for an audit of the company's financial records due to USDT's significant role in the broader crypto ecosystem. While Lutnick acknowledged the necessity of such audits for U.S. dollar stablecoin issuers, he refrained from demanding one for Tether. When questioned about advocating for an independent audit within three months, he responded, \"Upon my confirmation as Secretary of Commerce, I will faithfully execute my duties consistent with applicable government ethics laws and regulations.\"\n\nAddressing concerns about his influence on crypto regulation, Lutnick denied allegations of pledging to \"defuse threats\" against Tether. \"I have never suggested to anyone that I would do anything improper with respect to Tether,\" he stated, cautioning that \"the U.S. Congress should be careful not to undermine dollar hegemony on blockchain through legislation.\"",
