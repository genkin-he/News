            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News Caroline Pham, the new acting chairwoman of the U.S. CFTC, said on Tuesday that the regulator has reorganized its enforcement division to \"refocus\" on fraud and \"stop regulating through enforcement.\" \nUnder the leadership of former chairman Rostin Behnam, the CFTC Enforcement Division had several working groups, one of which focused on insider trading, another on cybersecurity and emerging technologies, and a third aimed at combating environmental fraud. The new reorganization reduces the number of working groups to just two. \nThe newly established Complex Fraud Working Group is responsible for handling enforcement work on complex fraud and manipulation across all asset classes, from preliminary investigations to litigation. Deputy Director of Enforcement Paul Hayeck will serve as the acting head of the Complex Fraud Working Group. The Retail Fraud and General Enforcement Working Group will handle retail fraud and general enforcement work, led by Charles Marvine, deputy director of the agency's enforcement division. \n“This streamlined structure will be less regulatory and more efficient in enforcement,” Pham said in a press statement. “These much-needed changes will maximize the CFTC’s resources and take more action to go after fraudsters and other bad actors, rather than punishing good citizens.”\n\nAccording to the CFTC’s announcement, the new structure will “more effectively use the CFTC’s resources to prevent fraud, manipulation, and abuse and ensure market integrity,” as well as “strengthen governance and oversight of enforcement matters to prevent overreach and enhance consistency, fairness, and due process.” (CoinDesk)",

            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News Since the launch of World Liberty (WLFI) in October last year, market observers have questioned the Trump family's possible conflicts of interest, as the Trump administration has absolute influence on regulation. Normally, the promise of investment returns hinted at by Eric Trump, the second son of Trump, for the first time, may attract the scrutiny of regulators such as the U.S. SEC, which usually believes that this indicates that an asset is a security that it should regulate.\nRyne Miller, partner at Lowenstein Sandler LLP and former general counsel of the U.S. division of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, said: \"We are still exploring new models for the future intersection of cryptocurrency and securities law. What remains unchanged is that regulators will expect transparency and disclosure and will continue to be very active when fraud or other similar misconduct is suspected. What we do hope to change is that good-faith statements and actions about cryptocurrency projects will not immediately escalate into the risk of SEC enforcement investigations, which is a welcome change.\" According to blockchain data analysis company Nansen, World Liberty's digital wallets had a net inflow of about 21,177 ETH on Monday, worth about $55 million, a figure that includes both purchases and conversions of ETH derivatives into cryptocurrencies. Nansen also estimated that World Liberty's digital wallets received a total of about $340 million worth of ETH net inflows between January 18 and February 1 before the funds were sent to Coinbase Prime's wallets. WLFI said: \"We are making daily transfers of crypto assets in accordance with regular financial management to pay fees and expenses and to meet liquidity needs. To be clear, we are not selling tokens - we are just reallocating assets for daily business purposes.\" (Bloomberg) \nPrevious news, Trump's second son Eric Trump said on X that now is a great time to increase ETH holdings (In my opinion, it's a great time to add ETH.).",

            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News The Trump administration has appointed Luke Pettit, an assistant to Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, to a senior position in the U.S. Treasury Department. According to a notice on Congress.gov, Pettit has been nominated as Assistant Secretary of Financial Institutions. Pettit will be in charge of the Treasury Department's department office, which plays an important role in formulating policies to regulate banks, fintech companies (including digital asset companies), non-bank mortgage institutions and many other financial companies. The position requires Senate approval.\nPettit has served as a senior policy adviser to Hagerty, a Republican from Tennessee, for the past three years. According to his LinkedIn profile, before that, he was an economist on the Senate Banking Committee and served at Bridgewater Fund, the Monetary Affairs Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Washington, and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.\nHe will replace Graham Steele, who held the position during the Biden administration. Steele left the Treasury Department in January 2024.\nEthan Fallang, a former Rumble Inc. board member and protégé of Vice President JD Vance, has also been appointed to a senior position in the Treasury Department's Office of Financial Institutions. Fallang was a top candidate for the position of deputy assistant secretary for capital markets, according to people familiar with the matter, but it is unclear whether he has accepted the position.
