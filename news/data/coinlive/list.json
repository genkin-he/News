            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News On-chain data shows that Ionic on Mode suffered a loss of $8.6 million from an attack.\nOn-chain detective ZachXBT said on this matter: Ionic's predecessor was the Midas protocol. Midas suffered two hacker attacks in 2023, but the Ionic project used the old audit report of Midas in 2022 when it went online.\nIn this regard, ZachXBT once sent a private message to the team to question the security of Ionic's contracts. The team said that their code base was based on the Compound fork, and the vulnerability in Midas was due to a known vulnerability in the Compound code. These problems have been fixed by implementing whitelists and reentry attack circuit breakers in the new pool, emphasizing that Ionic is very safe.\nOdaily previously reported that the Ionic platform based on Mode was hacked, and hackers used unofficial fake LBTC (Lombard BTC) as collateral for lending on the Ionic platform. The team is investigating, and Odaily reminds users not to interact with it.",
