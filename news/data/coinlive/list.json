Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates twice this year, while Morgan Stanley joins Barclays and Macquarie Bank in predicting that the Federal Reserve will only cut interest rates by 25 basis points once this year, citing the uncertainty brought about by US President Trump's tariff policy. The Federal Reserve also maintained its benchmark overnight interest rate in the range of 4.25%-4.50% at its January policy meeting. Fed Chairman Powell said that further reducing borrowing costs now depends on whether the Federal Reserve can make further progress in reducing stubbornly high inflation. (Jinshi)",

            "description": "According to Odaily, CryptoQuant's data reveals that Bitcoin's funding rate has turned negative seven times within the past year. Historically, the previous six instances of negative funding rates have indicated a strong bullish trend for Bitcoin. This metric reflects the cost of holding leveraged positions in perpetual futures contracts, suggesting that traders have become excessively bearish, which often signals a local bottom and a potential for significant rebound.\n\nIf historical patterns repeat, the market may soon shift towards a bullish trend. Currently, traders are closely monitoring liquidity levels below $98,000, with $100,000 considered a strong support level to reignite price discovery. A breakthrough at this level could trigger increased buying pressure. To fully restore bullish momentum and alter market sentiment, Bitcoin needs to reclaim the $103,600 mark.",
