When we first decided on the inflation rate, we referred to Solana's inflation plan to keep it relatively simple because we didn't want to follow the Cosmos standard inflation plan (i.e. a permanent 10% inflation rate). Recently, the community consensus is that this number is still too high, and now Solana is also proposing to reduce the inflation rate, so it's time for Celestia to adjust. I think a 33% reduction is the right balance, which can effectively adjust the inflation curve without overly endangering the security of the crypto economy.\"",
