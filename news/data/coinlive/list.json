In particular, the review of the Bureau of Fiscal Services has not resulted in the delay or change of payments for obligations such as Social Security and Medicare.\"\nThe letter marks the first time that the Treasury Department has publicly acknowledged and explained the position held by Tom Krause, CEO of Cloud Software Group, who has ties to DOGE. In recent weeks, Krause has been described as a central staff member with ties to DOGE, pushing efforts to ensure access to payment systems, and ultimately obtaining access granted by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\nThe letter states that Krause is now a Treasury employee with \"read-only access to the Fiscal Service Payment System's coded data to continue this operational efficiency assessment.\" (CNN)",
