It is reported that in April last year, Laton Ventures launched a $35 million global game venture capital fund, focusing on the importance of artificial intelligence and Web3 technology in games. Laton Ventures' investment portfolio covers mobile game studios and innovative social game platforms. Its investors include more than 40 well-known game and technology industry entrepreneurs and senior executives from more than 10 countries, such as founders or former executives of Peak, Gram, Loop and Huuuge.

            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News QCP Capital posted on its official channel that the crypto market is still in a roller coaster of volatility. BTC briefly rebounded to $100,000 after news that the United States would postpone tariffs on Mexico and Canada by one month, suggesting possible trade mediation. However, the relief was short-lived as China retaliated with new tariffs, with the price of BTC falling back to $98,000. In addition, China has launched an antitrust investigation into Google, indicating that China is ready to escalate tensions by targeting major U.S. technology companies. Any resulting sanctions or restrictions could weigh on earnings and pose a significant risk to risky assets. As BTC climbed to $100,000 last night, the market also reacted to Trump's executive order directing officials to create a U.S. sovereign wealth fund. While some see this as a potential source of new demand for Bitcoin, the details remain unclear - especially about how to fund it. For now, trade uncertainty continues to cloud the outlook, and as of March, the options market is currently balanced between puts and calls.",
