            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News Ripple CTO David Schwartz confirmed that Ripple's XRP Ledger has resumed operation after the network outage prevented verification from being released for more than an hour.\nXRPL's browser page shows that network activity was frozen at block height 93927174 for 64 minutes before the blockchain was restarted at 10:58 am (UTC time) on February 4.\nSchwartz said in an X post on February 4: \"It looks like consensus is running, but verification has not been released, causing the network to be interrupted.\" He added that the validator operator must manually intervene to \"select a reasonable starting point\" to establish enough consensus to pull the network to a coordinated ledger flow. Schwartz said his observations were preliminary and Ripple was still investigating the root cause.\nSchwartz pointed out that only a very small number of unique node list validators were forced to make changes to restart the network, \"so it is possible that the network will recover spontaneously.\"\nIn addition, RippleX's X account noted that customer funds remained safe throughout the incident. XRPSCAN data shows that there are about 2 million transactions per day, performed by 30,000 to 60,000 unique senders. Therefore, about 88,000 transactions may be delayed due to the network suspension.",
