            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News Ethereum has reached the consensus required to increase the network's Gas limit, with 50% of validators supporting the change to help improve the network's scalability. The Gas limit is a key parameter that determines the network's transaction capacity. Previously, the Gas limit was capped at 30 million, and now it has exceeded 31 million. The Gas limit adjustment requires approval from more than half of the validators to take effect, and this adjustment was completed yesterday. Once more than 50% of validators express support, the block Gas limit will be automatically adjusted without a hard fork. This is the first time Ethereum has implemented such a change under the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. The last adjustment occurred in 2021, when the Gas limit doubled from 15 million units to 30 million units. According to gaslimit.pics, the average Gas limit over the past 24 hours was 31.5 million units, and it is expected to be adjusted to a maximum of 36 million units. Although the Dencun upgrade and proto-dank sharding technology have recently improved scalability, increasing the gas limit is still necessary as the demand and complexity of Ethereum decentralized applications increase.
