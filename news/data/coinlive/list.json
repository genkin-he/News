            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News According to a recent report by Glassnode, Bitcoin has absorbed about $450 billion in additional capital since November 2022, bringing the total realized market value to $850 billion, making it a global macro asset that countries and institutions are paying attention to.\nIt said that the growth of Bitcoin's realized market value was driven by its increasingly important role on the global stage, which attracted institutions and sovereign entities. The report emphasizes that the participation of nation-states in Bitcoin is a key factor, including Bhutan's participation in large-scale mining operations, El Salvador's establishment of Bitcoin as legal tender, and the United States' consideration of its potential as a strategic reserve asset.\nIn addition, Bitcoin also acts as a decentralized payment network. Over the past year, the Bitcoin network has processed an average of $8.7 billion in adjusted economic transactions per day, with a total transaction volume of $3.2 trillion.\nThe report also pointed out that new demand is now exploding, rather than a continuous inflow as in previous cycles. Compared with the peak in 2021, the participation of small retail investors has declined, while large entities have increased their holdings.\nDespite the favorable market conditions, Google search interest in Bitcoin has not yet reached the level of 2021. The investor base is changing, with retail participants showing more strategic accumulation behavior. \nThe launch of the US spot Bitcoin ETF has enabled institutional investors to gain investment opportunities, with net inflows exceeding $40 billion within one year of launch and combined AUM exceeding $120 billion.\nThe Bitcoin investor base has shown resilience during market corrections. Actual losses in the current cycle are lower than in previous cycles, with the only major event being the yen carry liquidation on August 5, 2024. The report also highlights that unlike past cycles, Bitcoin's declines are more controlled and actual volatility is lower. \nOverall, the price action in this cycle is characterized by a series of rallies followed by a period of consolidation, with a more stable market structure as more mature participants trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.",
