Martin Jr., the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. The statement stated that the judicial department had conducted a preliminary review of the relevant evidence and found that individuals and groups had clearly threatened DOGE employees. At present, the department is working closely with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies, and has initiated prosecutorial procedures. Musk commented on the article: \"Don't mess with DOGE.\"",

In light of potential fiscal stimulus responses from other countries, the UK may need to take U.S. President Donald Trump's other threats more seriously, including tax cuts and immigration policies that could drive inflation. These actions by Trump are expected to have a hawkish impact on UK policy.",
