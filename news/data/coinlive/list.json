            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News: Two people familiar with the matter revealed that the US SEC now requires its lawyers to obtain high-level approval before officially launching an investigation. The new requirements stipulate that law enforcement officers must obtain permission from politically appointed commissioners to issue subpoenas, request documents and compel testimony. Previously, staff had the power to independently launch formal investigations, and SEC commissioners oversaw the entire process.\nThe change came after changes in SEC leadership, including the departure of former Chairman Gary Gensler and Democrat Jaime Lizárraga last month. President Trump appointed Mark Uyeda as acting chairman, and the commission currently consists of three commissioners: Uyeda, Hester Peirce, and Caroline Crenshaw.\nAccording to Tyler Warner, a former bank consultant and current NFT market analyst, the new system will prevent \"malicious attacks.\" SEC commissioners will act more cautiously and are less likely to approve investigations without solid evidence.\nOn the other hand, this procedural change may bring the risk of legitimate fraud cases being missed or delayed. “It’s too early to say whether it’s a net positive or negative, although I’m leaning toward positive,” Warner added.\nUnder the previous administration, the SEC needed approval from two enforcement chiefs to formally launch an investigation (the source did not specify whether the commission formally voted to revoke the previous authorization), while enforcement staff could continue informal investigations without commissioner approval, including sending requests for information.
