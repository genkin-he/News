            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News Citi said in its latest research report that as the adoption of digital assets grows, the correlation between Bitcoin and the stock market is expected to weaken in the long term. Citi pointed out that although the stock market is still the main macro driver of the crypto market, the correlation between the stock market and crypto assets will gradually decline as the crypto asset market matures, the investor base expands, and technological advances and adoption rates increase. In addition, further clarification of US crypto regulation may bring more market volatility driven by non-macro factors. The report also mentioned that Bitcoin's volatility is expected to continue to decline as institutional adoption grows. At the same time, Bitcoin's correlation with gold is worth paying attention to, which may be an early signal of its \"value storage\" attribute.",

Citi highlights that while the stock market remains a primary macroeconomic driver for the crypto market, the maturing of the crypto asset market, expansion of the investor base, technological advancements, and increased adoption rates will gradually reduce this correlation. Additionally, clearer U.S. crypto regulations may introduce more market fluctuations driven by non-macro factors. The report also notes that Bitcoin's volatility is anticipated to continue decreasing with the growth of institutional adoption.

            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News MicroStrategy temporarily stopped buying Bitcoin after buying it for 12 consecutive weeks. Some analysts believe that the company may be brewing a strategic change, while others believe that this is a temporary move and the company intends to start accumulating Bitcoin again.\nAnalysis points out that Bitcoin is very important to MicroStrategy, but factors such as managing cash flow, stock performance, and efforts to raise funds may affect its buying mentality in the short term. Over time, market volatility, investor concerns, and regulatory uncertainty may all change, causing the company to be more cautious about important decisions in the near future.\nWhen management decides to stop acquisitions altogether, the increased tax burden may become a real burden. The company may face a huge tax bill for unrealized Bitcoin gains, which may exceed $19 billion. Financial planning must be carried out to cope with tax obligations, allowing the company to continue to adhere to the Bitcoin strategy.\nSince its recent inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 Index, MicroStrategy has been subject to various rules and regulations, such as lock-up periods, which sometimes prevent insider trading from occurring, which may be another reason why Bitcoin sales have been suppressed.\nHowever, there is little sign that MicroStrategy is abandoning its Bitcoin-centric strategy. The company's history suggests that any interruption in its buying spree is likely to be strategic rather than a sign of declining confidence in Bitcoin. The current period may be a period of recalibration, allowing MicroStrategy to optimize its resources before resuming Bitcoin accumulation. (Bitcoinist)",
