They all said that the industry needs clear supervision. In the past, the SEC's practices forced many crypto companies to leave the United States. In the future, we must ensure that innovation in the crypto field occurs in the United States and has clearer supervision, because offshore companies will bring greater risks, such as FTX's headquarters in the Bahamas.\nDavid Sacks also said that stablecoins are a top priority and can ensure the status of the US dollar.",

            "description": "According to Cointelegraph, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is charting a new course for the cryptocurrency industry, focusing on the evaluation of crypto assets' security status and the potential provision of \"retroactive relief\" for specific token offerings. This initiative is part of the efforts by the White House's newly established Crypto Task Force, as outlined in a statement by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce on February 4.\n\nThe Crypto Task Force is advocating for the SEC to take action that would offer temporary prospective and retroactive relief for coin or token offerings under certain conditions. These conditions include the provision and regular updating of specified information and an agreement not to challenge the SEC's jurisdiction in cases alleging fraud related to the purchase and sale of the asset. Peirce emphasized the importance of these measures in providing clarity and guidance for the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nFurthermore, the Task Force is reassessing whether certain crypto assets should be classified as securities. Peirce highlighted that determining the status of crypto assets under securities laws is crucial for addressing numerous other regulatory questions. The Task Force is diligently examining various types of crypto assets to ensure appropriate regulatory measures are in place. This story is still developing, and additional details will be provided as they emerge.",
