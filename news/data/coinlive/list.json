            "title": "SEC Requires Top-Level Approval for Launching Probes Under New Republican Leadership",
            "description": "According to Reuters - In a significant procedural shift, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now mandates that its lawyers obtain approval from its politically appointed leaders before initiating formal investigations, according to two sources familiar with the matter. This change reflects a new approach under the Trump administration's leadership, aiming to centralize decision-making and potentially slow the pace of SEC investigations.Changes in SEC ProceduresHistorically, the authority to launch formal orders of investigation—which allow the issuance of subpoenas for testimony or documents—was delegated to lower-level staff within the SEC. However, under the new guidelines, this authority must now be approved by the Commission itself, which currently consists of two Republicans and one Democrat, all appointed by the president.Impact on Enforcement AutonomyThis recent development marks a departure from previous norms at the agency, where such decisions were more decentralized. \"The move to centralize these decisions could lead to fewer impulsive probes and might be seen as an attempt to protect individuals from undue investigations,\" one source noted, speaking on condition of anonymity. However, critics argue that it restricts the autonomy of enforcement staff and could lead to delays in addressing potential violations.Leadership and Political InfluenceThe change comes as Republican Mark Uyeda leads the SEC, alongside Commissioner Hester Peirce and Democrat Caroline Crenshaw. The former chair, Gary Gensler, and Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga, both Democrats, exited the commission last month. Paul Atkins, a former SEC Commissioner nominated by President Trump to lead the agency, is pending confirmation. Atkins is anticipated to significantly shift the SEC's focus from the strategies employed during the Biden administration.Enforcement Practices and Industry ImpactSEC enforcement staff retain the ability to conduct informal inquiries, including sending out requests for information without requiring Commission approval. This setup maintains some level of investigative activity but centralizes more significant enforcement actions.During a recent industry conference panel, Steven Peikin, former SEC co-director of enforcement under Republican Jay Clayton, expressed his views on the changes. \"Centralizing formal order authority might reduce the wastage of resources but could also lead to a bottleneck in handling cases efficiently,\" he speculated.Presidential Influence and Future DirectionsPresident Trump’s executive order on his first day in office aimed to end the \"weaponization\" of the federal government, which includes agencies like the SEC. The full implications of this order are still unfolding, with ongoing debates about its impact on the SEC’s operational autonomy and its approach to capital market regulation.The new enforcement strategy under the current administration highlights a shift towards a regulatory environment that may be perceived as more business-friendly, potentially easing some of the rigorous oversight seen in previous years.",

            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News: Two people familiar with the matter revealed that the US SEC now requires its lawyers to obtain high-level approval before officially launching an investigation. The new requirements stipulate that law enforcement officers must obtain permission from politically appointed commissioners to issue subpoenas, request documents and compel testimony. Previously, staff had the power to independently launch formal investigations, and SEC commissioners oversaw the entire process.\nThe change came after changes in SEC leadership, including the departure of former Chairman Gary Gensler and Democrat Jaime Lizárraga last month. President Trump appointed Mark Uyeda as acting chairman, and the commission currently consists of three commissioners: Uyeda, Hester Peirce, and Caroline Crenshaw.\nAccording to Tyler Warner, a former bank consultant and current NFT market analyst, the new system will prevent \"malicious attacks.\" SEC commissioners will act more cautiously and are less likely to approve investigations without solid evidence.\nOn the other hand, this procedural change may bring the risk of legitimate fraud cases being missed or delayed. “It’s too early to say whether it’s a net positive or negative, although I’m leaning toward positive,” Warner added.\nUnder the previous administration, the SEC needed approval from two enforcement chiefs to formally launch an investigation (the source did not specify whether the commission formally voted to revoke the previous authorization), while enforcement staff could continue informal investigations without commissioner approval, including sending requests for information.
