The decision comes after achieving a significant breakthrough in fully end-to-end humanoid robot AI, developed independently by the internal team.\n\nFigure AI stated that OpenAI's focus does not align with embedded artificial intelligence, prompting the company to concentrate on its own research and development. Analysts suggest that OpenAI might be developing its own hardware. While Adcock did not disclose specific details, he promised to unveil unprecedented humanoid robot technology within the next 30 days.",

            "description": "During the recent market downturn triggered by President Trump's new tariff policies, the crypto industry faced a significant sell-off, erasing billions in value. However, some decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols have not only weathered the storm but also showcased a robust performance compared to traditional financial (TradFi) systems. Amid the market volatility, Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) saw declines of at least 35% and 25%, respectively, yet key DeFi protocols stood firm against the pressures.Marc Zeller, founder of the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI), emphasized the resilience of the Aave platform during the crisis, stating, \"Aave's goal is to remain healthy and minimize the pain.\" This sentiment was echoed by long-time Ethereum commentator Evan Van Ness who noted that, aside from some minor frontend outages, DeFi platforms have generally outperformed TradFi during this period.According to data from Block Analitica, Aave processed approximately $210 million in liquidations during the downturn. This compares to $263 million liquidated on Aave V2 from December 2020 to December 2022. Chaos Labs, a risk service provider, reported that this was the largest liquidation day on record, with over 80% of these liquidations occurring on the Aave Ethereum platform.One significant aspect of Aave's system is its approach to liquidations. \"Most importantly, compared to other venues, Aave does not force the closure of all user positions when liquidations occur. Only up to half can be used for liquidation, mitigating user losses,\" Zeller explained. This mechanism played a critical role in preserving user equity during the market's rapid movements.The efforts of DeFi developers to create secure and stable platforms have proven their worth, with protocols like Aave leading by example. The integration of Chainlink's smart value recovery solution is a forthcoming enhancement aimed at making liquidations more efficient and potentially more profitable for the protocol.Overall, the robust performance of DeFi protocols during the tariff-induced crisis highlights their potential as resilient alternatives to traditional financial systems, especially in times of significant economic stress.",
