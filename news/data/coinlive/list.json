            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News Polymarket predicts that the probability of \"the United States establishing a national Bitcoin reserve in 2025\" has risen to 47%. The cumulative bet amount for this prediction is currently $687,000, and the deadline is December 31, 2025.\nThe judgment criteria are that the US government holds any amount of Bitcoin in its reserves, excluding Bitcoin confiscated by the US government. The main source of judgment will be official information from the US government or the Federal Reserve, and will also refer to credible reports with consensus recognition.\nEarlier today, David Sacks, director of AI and cryptocurrency at the White House, said at a press conference in Washington on Tuesday about potential Bitcoin reserves: \"This is one of the top issues we will consider as a working group within the government. We are still waiting for some cabinet members in the working group to be confirmed, so it is still in a very early stage. But this is one of the top issues we have to consider.\"",

            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of Thailand is preparing to deploy a DLT-based debt instrument trading system, with the main goal of encouraging securities companies to engage in digital token trading.\nAccording to Jomkwan Kongsakul, deputy secretary-general of the SEC, the regulator has approved four digital token projects and is evaluating two more projects, focusing on green tokens and investment-driven programs.\nKongsakul explained that it takes 7-14 days to buy bonds from the primary market before they can be traded in the secondary market. Investors also face challenges such as limited access to certain products and the high cost and poor liquidity of some bonds.\nAt the same time, issuers need to deal with a lot of manual paperwork, which is prone to delays and errors. Therefore, the use of DLT is expected to ensure efficiency and simplify processes while addressing obstacles in the capital market.\nThe regulator aims to fully digitize the bond trading system in the primary and secondary markets, including settlement, trading, investor registration and return payment. Kongsakul promised that competition will remain open because companies with their own DLT infrastructure can build independent chains as long as they ensure interoperability within unified standards. Other companies can access the SEC’s public chain at an affordable cost. Going forward, multiple trading chains are likely to emerge, with all DLT-based systems interconnected through a shared ledger, which is expected to be completed soon.\nExisting financial products will remain but will be converted to digital counterparts to facilitate smooth trading on the DLT network. This approach facilitates fragmented trading at a lower cost and improves liquidity by bringing in more participants, while enabling real-time trading and reducing settlement issues.\nIn addition, the regulator is developing the SEC Open API data platform to provide comprehensive data on all listed companies, helping investors conduct better analysis and make more informed investment decisions.
