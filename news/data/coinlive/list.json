            "description": "According to Odaily, Federal Reserve Governor Jefferson has stated that there is no immediate need to further cut interest rates, citing the robust economy as a reason for a cautious approach. He anticipates that inflation will continue to decline, although this process may be gradual. In the medium term, interest rates are expected to decrease. The Federal Reserve is currently navigating uncertainties related to government policies, with expectations that economic growth and labor market conditions will remain strong.",

            "description": "MicroStrategy sold preferred stock units last week, a debt-like security with an 8% coupon. The shares were sold at $80 per share, 20% below the market price, effectively pushing the buyer's yield to 10%, a major concession to complete the deal.\nJames Dinsmore, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds Inc. who focuses on convertible securities, said: \"I can't remember the last time I saw something so low, and obviously there was some resistance to the initial pricing.\"\nNevertheless, the investor-friendly terms of the deal allowed the company to raise $563 million, more than double its initial target, as co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor is exploring a variety of capital structures to support his Bitcoin buying strategy. This demand shows the market's interest in this asset class, and the company said that although it is more expensive than the ultra-low interest convertible bonds and par stocks previously issued, it can use it to raise up to $2 billion this quarter.\nMicroStrategy did not respond to a request for comment.\n\"A 10% yield is not cheap capital, but I think it's appropriate given the company's profile,\" said David Clott, portfolio manager at Wellesley Asset Management. \"And they won't dilute existing investors like they did with the previous convertible bond issuance. This is a good result for them because they open up a new financing market.\" The plan is part of the company's broader plan to raise $42 billion over three years through a combination of stocks and fixed-income securities, and it is expected to turn to the latter this quarter. This is partly because the company raised nearly $17 billion through its stock sale plan, while it raised much less through convertible bonds. The company currently owns about $47 billion in Bitcoin, accounting for more than 2% of its total. (Bloomberg) Earlier, MicroStrategy announced that it would issue 7,300,000 shares of 8.00% Series A perpetual exercise preferred stock (\"perpetual exercise preferred stock\") on January 30, 2025, with a public offering price of $80.00 per share. The issuance and sale of the perpetually exercisable preferred stock is scheduled to close on February 5, 2025, subject to customary closing conditions.\nMicroStrategy estimates that the net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and MicroStrategy's estimated offering expenses, will be approximately $563.4 million. MicroStrategy intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin, and for working capital.",

            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News Caroline Pham, the new acting chairwoman of the U.S. CFTC, said on Tuesday that the regulator has reorganized its enforcement division to \"refocus\" on fraud and \"stop regulating through enforcement.\" \nUnder the leadership of former chairman Rostin Behnam, the CFTC Enforcement Division had several working groups, one of which focused on insider trading, another on cybersecurity and emerging technologies, and a third aimed at combating environmental fraud. The new reorganization reduces the number of working groups to just two. \nThe newly established Complex Fraud Working Group is responsible for handling enforcement work on complex fraud and manipulation across all asset classes, from preliminary investigations to litigation. Deputy Director of Enforcement Paul Hayeck will serve as the acting head of the Complex Fraud Working Group. The Retail Fraud and General Enforcement Working Group will handle retail fraud and general enforcement work, led by Charles Marvine, deputy director of the agency's enforcement division. \n“This streamlined structure will be less regulatory and more efficient in enforcement,” Pham said in a press statement. “These much-needed changes will maximize the CFTC’s resources and take more action to go after fraudsters and other bad actors, rather than punishing good citizens.”\n\nAccording to the CFTC’s announcement, the new structure will “more effectively use the CFTC’s resources to prevent fraud, manipulation, and abuse and ensure market integrity,” as well as “strengthen governance and oversight of enforcement matters to prevent overreach and enhance consistency, fairness, and due process.” (CoinDesk)",

            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News Since the launch of World Liberty (WLFI) in October last year, market observers have questioned the Trump family's possible conflicts of interest, as the Trump administration has absolute influence on regulation. Normally, the promise of investment returns hinted at by Eric Trump, the second son of Trump, for the first time, may attract the scrutiny of regulators such as the U.S. SEC, which usually believes that this indicates that an asset is a security that it should regulate.\nRyne Miller, partner at Lowenstein Sandler LLP and former general counsel of the U.S. division of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, said: \"We are still exploring new models for the future intersection of cryptocurrency and securities law. What remains unchanged is that regulators will expect transparency and disclosure and will continue to be very active when fraud or other similar misconduct is suspected. What we do hope to change is that good-faith statements and actions about cryptocurrency projects will not immediately escalate into the risk of SEC enforcement investigations, which is a welcome change.\" According to blockchain data analysis company Nansen, World Liberty's digital wallets had a net inflow of about 21,177 ETH on Monday, worth about $55 million, a figure that includes both purchases and conversions of ETH derivatives into cryptocurrencies. Nansen also estimated that World Liberty's digital wallets received a total of about $340 million worth of ETH net inflows between January 18 and February 1 before the funds were sent to Coinbase Prime's wallets. WLFI said: \"We are making daily transfers of crypto assets in accordance with regular financial management to pay fees and expenses and to meet liquidity needs. To be clear, we are not selling tokens - we are just reallocating assets for daily business purposes.\" (Bloomberg) \nPrevious news, Trump's second son Eric Trump said on X that now is a great time to increase ETH holdings (In my opinion, it's a great time to add ETH.).",
