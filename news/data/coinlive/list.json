            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News: Several American unions have applied to the court for a temporary injunction, requiring the Treasury Department to stop providing citizens' personal and financial data to Musk's Office of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and to recover the leaked information. The lawsuit stated that Scott Bessent, head of the Treasury Department, allowed DOGE to access the federal payment system, which contains confidential data of taxpayers, government employees and companies, which is suspected of being illegal. The union believes that this data sharing violates the privacy of members and asks the court to intervene and suspend related operations before the case is decided.\nThe Treasury Department responded that DOGE only has \"read-only\" permissions and the data is encrypted and will not affect the government payment process. But the union warned that if emergency measures are not taken, members' privacy may face irreversible infringement. (Bloomberg)",

This move not only affects the global trade pattern, but may also prompt more investors to turn to Bitcoin as a safe haven. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, pointed out that the unconventional use of IEEPA may accelerate global de-dollarization and drive capital flows to decentralized assets such as Bitcoin to hedge against economic instability. Crypto derivatives trader Gordon Grant also believes that the frequent use of IEEPA may weaken the credit of the US dollar and make digital assets such as Bitcoin more attractive. (TheBlock)",
