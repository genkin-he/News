            "description": "According to Odaily, Stronghold Digital Mining has agreed to pay more than $1.4 million in penalties and refunds following an investigation by U.S. federal agencies. The investigation revealed that the company violated energy market regulations while prioritizing its Bitcoin mining operations. Stronghold Digital, along with its subsidiary Scrubgrass Reclamation Company, operates the 85-megawatt Scrubgrass power plant in northwest Pennsylvania. This plant has been functioning as a capacity resource for the PJM Interconnection energy market from 2018 to 2022.\n\nThe settlement agreement, released by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on January 30, outlines Stronghold's contractual obligation to supply available power to the PJM grid to ensure grid reliability. However, the FERC enforcement office found that between June 2021 and May 2022, Stronghold failed to meet this obligation, diverting power to its Bitcoin mining operations instead.\n\nFERC's investigation revealed that Scrubgrass underreported its available power capacity in the market, accounting for 67% of day-ahead and 69% of real-time power. Instead of supplying this power to PJM, it was redirected to Bitcoin mining, comprising 57% of day-ahead and 59% of real-time power.\n\nAdditionally, the settlement order noted that Stronghold purchased power from PJM at wholesale prices 24% of the time, with some of this power being misclassified as \"station power\" rather than being used for essential plant operations.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Stronghold and Scrubgrass will repay $678,635 in improper earnings to PJM and pay a civil penalty of $741,365 to the U.S. Treasury. The company is also required to submit compliance reports for at least two years and provide market rules training for its employees.",

            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News According to ultrasound.money data, the supply of Ethereum is currently 120,521,523 ETH, which is about 383 more than the supply on the day of the merge upgrade. Jaehyun Ha, an analyst at Presto Research, said that the network's Dencun upgrade last year was the cause of the expansion of Ethereum's supply.\nJaehyun Ha said, \"With the launch of the Dencun upgrade, Ethereum added support for blob transactions, which is designed to handle large data loads (especially L2) more efficiently. These transactions use a separate fee unit called 'blob gas', which is different from the standard Gas fee applicable to regular transactions. As a large amount of transaction activity shifted to blob transactions, this change resulted in a decrease in the proportion of destroyed fees. Reducing fees means that even if overall network activity remains high or grows, the balancing effect that previously limited the net supply of ETH is now less obvious.\" (The Block)",

SkyBridge Capital holds $1.4 billion in digital assets, representing 57% of its total assets under management, while over 60% of Scaramucci's personal wealth is in Bitcoin. Scaramucci further noted that if institutions fully adopt cryptocurrencies, banks could custody them, retain them on their balance sheets, and leverage their capital to become major investors in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. He described this potential development as a profoundly impactful and powerful move.",

Despite enduring a two-year bear market and a market capitalization drop of over 70%, stablecoins continue to demonstrate robust growth. In 2024, stablecoin transactions reached $15.6 trillion, surpassing Visa and Mastercard's transaction volumes by approximately 119% and 200%, respectively. However, the monthly transaction count for stablecoins was 110 million, which is only 0.41% and 0.72% of Visa and Mastercard's transaction volumes. This indicates that the average transaction value for stablecoins is significantly higher than that of Visa and Mastercard.",
