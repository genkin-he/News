            "description": "According to Cointelegraph, the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization markets have reached an all-time high in terms of value tokenized onchain, with a total value locked (TVL) of $17.1 billion. This milestone, achieved in early February, marks a significant recovery for the sector, which has seen a 94% increase in TVL compared to the same period last year, as reported by industry analytics platform RWA.xyz. The surge in RWA tokenization markets coincides with a broader recovery in the crypto market, driven by news that U.S. President Donald Trump has temporarily halted tariffs targeting Canada and Mexico. Over the past 24 hours, the total crypto market capitalization has risen by approximately 7%, with RWA-related digital assets experiencing even greater gains. Notably, Chainlink (LINK), a blockchain oracle provider for real-world assets, saw its native token increase by 22%, reaching over $21. Similarly, Mantra (OM), a layer-1 blockchain focused on RWA, saw its token rise by 23% to $6, while Ondo Finance (ONDO), a DeFi platform, surged nearly 27% to $1.40. The RWA tokenization market's TVL began to rise sharply in early November, aligning with a broader crypto market surge. Since then, it has increased by approximately 26%, or $4 billion. Private credit accounts for nearly 70% of the onchain value, followed by U.S. Treasury debts at 21%, according to RWZ.xyz. Wall Street is also taking notice of the RWA tokenization market, which is projected to reach $30 trillion. Haqq Network co-founder Andrey Kuznetsov highlighted the transformative impact of asset tokenization on financial markets, noting that major financial institutions are preparing to lead this change. Eli Cohen, general counsel of the RWA tokenization platform Centrifuge, anticipates that the Trump administration will publicly renounce restrictive policies, further boosting RWA market growth in 2025.",
