            "description": "According to Odaily, CryptoQuant's data reveals that Bitcoin's funding rate has turned negative seven times within the past year. Historically, the previous six instances of negative funding rates have indicated a strong bullish trend for Bitcoin. This metric reflects the cost of holding leveraged positions in perpetual futures contracts, suggesting that traders have become excessively bearish, which often signals a local bottom and a potential for significant rebound.\n\nIf historical patterns repeat, the market may soon shift towards a bullish trend. Currently, traders are closely monitoring liquidity levels below $98,000, with $100,000 considered a strong support level to reignite price discovery. A breakthrough at this level could trigger increased buying pressure. To fully restore bullish momentum and alter market sentiment, Bitcoin needs to reclaim the $103,600 mark.",
