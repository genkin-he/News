            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News According to a recent report by Glassnode, Bitcoin has absorbed about $450 billion in additional capital since November 2022, bringing the total realized market value to $850 billion, making it a global macro asset that countries and institutions are paying attention to.\nIt said that the growth of Bitcoin's realized market value was driven by its increasingly important role on the global stage, which attracted institutions and sovereign entities. The report emphasizes that the participation of nation-states in Bitcoin is a key factor, including Bhutan's participation in large-scale mining operations, El Salvador's establishment of Bitcoin as legal tender, and the United States' consideration of its potential as a strategic reserve asset.\nIn addition, Bitcoin also acts as a decentralized payment network. Over the past year, the Bitcoin network has processed an average of $8.7 billion in adjusted economic transactions per day, with a total transaction volume of $3.2 trillion.\nThe report also pointed out that new demand is now exploding, rather than a continuous inflow as in previous cycles. Compared with the peak in 2021, the participation of small retail investors has declined, while large entities have increased their holdings.\nDespite the favorable market conditions, Google search interest in Bitcoin has not yet reached the level of 2021. The investor base is changing, with retail participants showing more strategic accumulation behavior. \nThe launch of the US spot Bitcoin ETF has enabled institutional investors to gain investment opportunities, with net inflows exceeding $40 billion within one year of launch and combined AUM exceeding $120 billion.\nThe Bitcoin investor base has shown resilience during market corrections. Actual losses in the current cycle are lower than in previous cycles, with the only major event being the yen carry liquidation on August 5, 2024. The report also highlights that unlike past cycles, Bitcoin's declines are more controlled and actual volatility is lower. \nOverall, the price action in this cycle is characterized by a series of rallies followed by a period of consolidation, with a more stable market structure as more mature participants trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.",

            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News Crypto research company Kaiko pointed out in its latest report that cryptocurrencies are in a tricky situation. Bitcoin and Ethereum short-term funding rates (usually used as an indicator of market sentiment) are low, indicating that investors are struggling to find a clear direction. At the same time, the end-of-month option expiration shows a balance, which means that traders are betting that volatility will be short-lived, and the wave of liquidations in the derivatives market has also exacerbated volatility. The open interest of Bitcoin and Ethereum on mainstream CEXs fell by 4% and 12% respectively last weekend.\nSince December last year, South Korea's cryptocurrency trading volume has fallen sharply, and altcoins led by XRP and DOGE continued to face strong selling pressure throughout January. Taking Upbit as an example, large DOGE orders dominate the high price range, which may indicate that large traders or whales are leading the sell-off and may be taking profits. XRP is the most actively traded asset on Upbit in January, with a cumulative trading volume of approximately US$790 million, more than twice that of DOGE.\nIn addition, most Meme tokens have lagged behind the broader market, but the frenzy is far from over, and major U.S. exchanges such as Coinbase are currently considering switching from an \"allow list\" to a \"block list\" strategy to more effectively manage the influx of Meme coins. But for Trump, investors never know what will happen. Kaiko analyst Adam McCarthy said: \"He (Trump) is like a toddler who is testing his limits.\"",

            "description": "According to BlockBeats, on February 5, the three major U.S. stock indices closed higher on Tuesday, continuing the recovery trend from Monday's V-shaped reversal. Strong corporate earnings have bolstered investor optimism. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3%, the S&P 500 increased by 0.72%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.35%. Major tech stocks saw significant gains, with Apple, Tesla, and Google each rising over 2%.\n\nIn contrast, the cryptocurrency market experienced a downturn. Bitcoin, which had been striving to maintain the $100,000 mark, faced a significant pullback, dropping to around $96,000 this morning. This decline was attributed to the lack of specific details on U.S. Bitcoin reserves in David Sacks' speech and escalating U.S.-China trade tensions, which increased market uncertainty. The downturn in Bitcoin led to a broader decline in altcoins. Ethereum fell 3.2% over the past 24 hours, currently priced at $2,718, while SOL decreased by 4.5% to $205. Bitcoin's market dominance has risen from a December low of 53% to 61%, reaching a four-year high, indicating a shift of funds from altcoins to Bitcoin.\n\nInvestors are currently focused on the upcoming U.S. non-farm payroll data due on Friday, along with speeches from several Federal Reserve officials and the latest developments in the U.S.-China trade war. This week also marks a busy earnings season for U.S. stocks. Industry statistics reveal that out of 211 S&P 500 companies that have reported fourth-quarter earnings, 76.8% have exceeded analysts' expectations, further boosting investor confidence.",
