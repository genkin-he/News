            "title": "Industry insiders: Key DeFi protocols successfully withstood pressure during the tariff crisis and outperformed TradFi during the crisis",
            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News: Driven by Trump's tariffs on major US trading partners, the market sold off sharply, causing billions of dollars in total market value to evaporate from the crypto industry. However, some DeFi founders see this as a bullish signal.\nSeveral developers said that despite ETH falling by at least 35% and SOL falling by about 25%, several key protocols withstood the stress test. Marc Zeller, founder of Aave Chan Initiative (ACI), the Aave contribution team, said in a private message: \"Aave's goal is to stay healthy and minimize pain.\"\nIn addition, Evan Van Ness, a long-time Ethereum commentator, said: \"Except for some isolated incidents of front-end downtime, it's good to see that Sky is running well. In times of crisis, DeFi performs better than TradFi.\" According to data source Block Analitica, Sky has 19 new liquidation positions involving assets worth more than $8 million. MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen said: \"From what I understand, everything is going smoothly.\"\nTo put the situation into perspective, risk services provider Chaos Labs said that Aave processed about $210 million in liquidations during the market downturn. In comparison, according to a previously published report, about $263 million was liquidated on Aave V2 between December 2020 and December 2022.\n\"Rapid market volatility led to a large number of liquidation events in the lending and perpetual contract markets, marking the largest day of liquidations ever,\" Chaos said in a status report, noting that more than 80% of liquidations occurred on the Aave Ethereum mainnet.\n\"Most importantly, compared to other venues, Aave does not force all user positions to close when liquidations occur. Only up to half are available for liquidation, mitigating user losses,\" said Zeller. According to Block Analytica data, the amounts of these liquidated positions ranged from tens of thousands of dollars to less than $100.\nZeller believes that the performance of the protocol, and many other decentralized protocols, shows that the effort to design secure platforms that simply “work properly” is worth it. He noted that the Aave team is working to integrate Chainlink’s smart value recovery solution to make liquidations more efficient and more profitable for the protocol. (The Block)",

            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News Crypto-friendly U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent quickly got to work after taking on the role of acting director of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Now, Bessent has essentially put the CFPB on lockdown.\nStaff will cease any litigation, investigations, or enforcement proceedings and avoid making public statements. According to a memo, the effective date of any previously approved rules will also be suspended.\nThe shift is seen as particularly beneficial to the crypto industry, which was also a target of former CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. The CFPB proposed last month to expand the agency's electronic funds regulation to cryptocurrencies.\nWhile the rule is unlikely to be finalized, even the existence of such a proposal could affect pending litigation matters. The wording in the proposal could also be adopted by states, several of which already have nearly identical electronic funds transfer regulations.\nThe Trump administration has not yet nominated anyone to serve as CFPB director. (Blockworks)\nYesterday's news that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is currently serving as the acting director of the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) indicates that the Trump administration may shift the strict law enforcement and regulatory approach under Rohit Chopra. Chopra was previously fired by the Trump administration. The Biden-era official imposed billions of dollars in fines and consumer compensation on banks such as Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup during his tenure.",

Although WazirX claims that creditors can recover up to 80% of their balances through its new DEX and recovery token model, its proposed recovery plan has sparked controversy.\nMany users remain skeptical, and some critics believe that the five-year delay is a strategic means to force creditors to accept a new platform rather than a real recovery move.",
