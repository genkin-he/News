            "description": "Odaily Planet Daily News: The U.S. Congress recently proposed the \"2025 U.S. Artificial Intelligence Capability Decoupling from China Act\", which prohibits Americans from assisting China in promoting AI and prohibits Americans from downloading or using DeepSeek. Otherwise, it will be classified as a crime and may be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $1 million.\nThe bill states that if American individuals or companies cooperate with Chinese colleges, universities or laboratories on AI, they may be breaking the law. Illegal companies may be fined up to $100 million. In addition, non-U.S. citizens involved in technology transfer may face deportation.\nThe bill was proposed by Republican Senator Josh Hawley, who served as the Attorney General of Missouri and participated in investigations into suspected election interference by large technology companies, including investigations of Google and Facebook.\nThe United States has previously banned government officials and others from using the DeepSeek application, including major administrative agencies such as the Department of Defense and Congress.

Schwartz said his observations were preliminary and Ripple was still investigating the root cause.\nSchwartz pointed out that only a very small number of unique node list validators were forced to make changes to restart the network, \"so it is possible that the network will recover spontaneously.\"\nIn addition, RippleX's X account noted that customer funds remained safe throughout the incident. XRPSCAN data shows that there are about 2 million transactions per day, performed by 30,000 to 60,000 unique senders. Therefore, about 88,000 transactions may be delayed due to the network suspension.",
