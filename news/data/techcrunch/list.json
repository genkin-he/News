            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">AI is changing how we shop online, making our experiences more personalized. Smart assistants recommend products, negotiate deals, and even handle customer service. Big retailers and smaller businesses are using AI to improve search, supply chains, and checkout. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If AI companies (and their investors) have their way, shopping will soon be focused on chatting with an assistant, with businesses automating everything behind the scenes. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dubai-based <a href=\"https://www.qeen.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">Qeen.ai</a> (stylized as qeen.ai) is working to make this a reality in the Middle East and beyond. The startup has raised $10 million to scale its platform, which provides autonomous AI agents for e-commerce businesses.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prosus Ventures, a major e-commerce investor, led the seed round, which is not only one of the largest in the Middle East’s AI industry but in MENA overall. The VC believes Qeen.ai is well-positioned to bring AI-driven automation to merchants as AI agents reshape online marketplaces.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founders <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mibrahimi/?originalSubdomain=ca\" rel=\"nofollow\">Morteza Ibrahimi </a>(CEO), <a href=\"https://ae.linkedin.com/in/ahmadkhwileh\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ahmad Khwlieh</a> (CTO), and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dina-alsamhan-3a5aa024/?originalSubdomain=ae\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dina Alsamhan</a> (CBO) started Qeen after years of working on AI at Google and DeepMind. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ibrahimi, in an interview with TechCrunch, said that they honed in on e-commerce in part opportunistically: all three had worked at Google Ads in various roles during their time with the search giant, and they and saw first-hand how other alums built highly successful e-commerce businesses. On top of their AI expertise, the trio knew how to run ads and optimize SEO exceptionally well and thought it could be a strong combination.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-google-and-deepmind-background\">Google and DeepMind background</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">E-commerce has been steadily growing for years, but apart from certain spikes (particularly during holiday periods) it still accounts for between 15% and 20% of retail sales (even in a mature market like the U.S. it was only just over 16% at of the last quarter, per the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/www/data/pdf/ec_current.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Census Bureau</a>). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Qeen’s thesis is that this could grow if the e-commerce processes were run better. Success in e-commerce, they believed, should be about great products and operational efficiency — not just who can game the ad system best. That insight led them to build a platform that helps e-commerce sellers grow without relying on ads as their primary driver.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The global e-commerce market is expanding fast, driven by changing consumer behavior, digital payments, and better logistics. In MENA, the market is expected to hit $50 billion by 2025, with Saudi Arabia and the UAE leading the growth.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Qeen.ai is tapping into this boom by developing AI-powered marketing agents designed for e-commerce businesses across MENA. These fully automated agents handle content creation, marketing, and conversational sales, allowing small and mid-sized merchants to compete without relying on expensive agencies or deep ad expertise. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike traditional solutions, Qeen’s AI continuously learns from consumer interactions using its proprietary RL-UI technology, refining marketing strategies in real-time for better results.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-google-ads-to-ai-driven-e-commerce\">From Google ads to AI-driven e-commerce</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While AI-powered sales and customer service tools often struggle with high churn rates, as businesses frequently switch platforms, Qeen.ai claims to see stronger retention in e-commerce and marketing. Ibrahimi attributes this to how deeply Qeen’s AI agents integrate into merchants’ workflows, making them a core part of daily operations rather than a replaceable tool.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A key feature driving engagement is dynamic text personalization, which adjusts content based on user behavior and device type. For example, an iPhone user might see product details in bullet points for quick reading, while a laptop user gets a detailed paragraph. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since launching its Dynamic Content agent in Q2 2024, Qeen.ai has served over 15 million users, generated 1 million SKU descriptions, and helped merchants increase sales by 30%, according to the company.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We worked with a client to optimize their content and SEO. After using our AI plugins, their search volume increased by 40%, and their Google ranking improved from 22 to 18—all with zero manual effort. The entire process was fully autonomous,” said Ibrahimi, giving another instance where Qeen’s AI capabilities have shone. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Qeen employs a subscription-based pricing model and incorporates value-based pricing, a growing trend in AI services. Currently, qeen generates revenue through two subscription models: content automation, where businesses pay per active SKU, typically $0.10 to $0.20 per SKU per month. Then its AI marketing agent whose pricing is based on per-interaction volume. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ibrahimi declined to disclose the number of businesses using qeen, as well as revenue growth metrics. Notable clients include Dubai Store, 6th Street, and Jumia.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-standing-out-with-talent\">Standing out… with talent</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ibrahimi left DeepMind in early 2023 to co-found the startup. That same year, the company raised a $2 million pre-seed round before launching its product in June 2024. With its recent $10 million seed round, qeen has raised a total of $12 million in under a year.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During this time, AI-powered marketing agents have gained traction worldwide, with several startups, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, entering the space. Competitors like YC-backed Unusual and Rankai are tackling similar challenges, so how does Qeen stand out?</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Well, for one, most of these AI startups focus on developed markets, while Qeen instead is prioritizing the Middle East first—a region largely underserved by AI-driven marketing automation tools. According to Ibrahimi, Qeen will serve small businesses across MENA, establish a strong foothold, and then expand globally.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deep tech expertise and a strong talent pool give Qeen an edge over new entrants, the chief executive added. Two of its co-founders earned PhDs in AI over a decade ago, long before AI became mainstream. Ibrahimi himself previously led a DeepMind research team specializing in self-learning, goal-driven AI agents—the same technology that now powers Qeen.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the most exciting things we’ve seen is the quality of AI talent here,” Ibrahimi said. “We’ve attracted great talent both locally and internationally—people have left the Bay Area, Europe, and the UK to come here and build with us.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Qeen.ai currently employs over 25 people across the UAE and Jordan.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The seed funding will support qeen’s growth strategy by expanding its AI platform, scaling its team, and attracting more customers, it said. Wamda Capital, 10X Founders Fund, and Dara Holdings are among the other investors in this round.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Tabular data is a broad term that encompasses structured data that generally fits into a specific row and column. It can be a SQL database, a spreadsheet, a .CSV file, etc.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While there has been tremendous progress on artificial intelligence applied to unstructured and sequential data, these large language models are fuzzy by design. They are built to manipulate input tokens to generate a coherent output without necessarily following a fixed structure. The best LLMs are also either expensive to access via an API or expensive to run on your own cloud infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And yet, many companies already have a data strategy with a data warehouse or data lake to centralize all important data and some data scientists that can leverage this data to improve the company’s strategy. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">French startup <a href=\"https://www.neuralk-ai.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Neuralk-AI</a> is an artificial intelligence company has been working on AI models focused on tabular data. The company this week announced $4 million in funding.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Data with real value for companies is data that was identified a long time ago, structured in the form of a table, and used by the data scientists of these companies to create all their machine learning algorithms,” Nueralk-AI co-founder and Chief Scientist Officer Alexandre Pasquiou told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Neuralk-AI thinks there’s an opportunity in revisiting AI model development, but with a specific focus on structured data. At first, it plans to offer its model as an API to data scientists working for commerce companies because these companies <em>love</em> data — think product catalogs, customer databases, shopping cart trends, etc.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Today, LLMs are great for search, natural user interaction, and answering questions based on unstructured documents. But it has some limitations the moment we go back to classic machine learning, which is really based on classic tabular data,” Pasquiou said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Neuralk-AI, retailers can automate complex data workflows with smart deduplication and enrichment. But they could also use the company’s models to detect fraud, optimize the product recommendations, and generate sales forecasts that could be used for inventory management and product pricing.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fly Ventures led the company’s $4 million round with SteamAI also participating. Several business angels also invested in the startup, such as Thomas Wolf from Hugging Face, Charles Gorintin from Alan, and Philippe Corrot and Nagi Letaifa from Mirakl.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The team is still actively working on its models. It plans to test with a group of leading French retailers and commerce startups, such as E.Leclerc, Auchan, Mirakl, and Lucky Cart.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Within three or four months, we’ll release the first version of our model and the public benchmark on which we’ll be able to rank our model compared to the state-of-the-art in this space,” Pasquiou said. “And in September, the idea is to be the best tabular foundation model in everything related to representation learning.”</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://www.presentations.ai/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Presentations.ai</a>, an Indian startup that uses AI to help companies quickly generate presentation decks, has raised $3 million in a seed round led by Accel to scale its software that has emerged from beta after amassing millions of users.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Presentations are ubiquitous throughout a business journey — whether a large corporation or a startup — to acquire new customers, update investors, and communicate milestones internally. Yet, businesses still struggle, spending hours cracking compelling presentations, which is even more critical when targeting clients or investors.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People struggle to take the first draft of a presentation,” said Sumanth Raghavendra, co-founder and CEO of Presenations.ai, in an exclusive interview.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Bengaluru-based startup has made that easier with its AI-powered platform, used by over 5 million people worldwide since its public beta launch in 2023, according to the company. “We want to be the ChatGPT for presentation. Think about making a presentation using AI, using that same construct that ChatGPT operates under,” Raghavendra told TechCrunch.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2958816\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1280\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/presentation-ai-team.jpg\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/presentation-ai-team.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/presentation-ai-team.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/presentation-ai-team.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/presentation-ai-team.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/presentation-ai-team.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/presentation-ai-team.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/presentation-ai-team.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/presentation-ai-team.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/presentation-ai-team.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/presentation-ai-team.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/presentation-ai-team.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/presentation-ai-team.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/presentation-ai-team.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/presentation-ai-team.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/presentation-ai-team.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/presentation-ai-team.jpg?resize=708,472 708w\" width=\"1920\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Presentations.ai team, with Sumanth Raghavendra on the far right in the second row (in a green shirt)</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Presentations.ai</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2019, Presentations.ai saw ChatGPT’s emergence in late 2022 as the moment to come out of stealth and start onboarding new users. The startup amassed a million users within three months of its public beta and is currently making “millions of dollars” in profit, Raghavendra said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before Presentations.ai, Raghvendra founded Deck App Technologies, which developed an app to help people create business content using smartphones. However, he noted that the earlier venture had a “limited degree of success” as mobile devices did not become an instrument to create content other than videos.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the years, Raghvendra said that his team had created IPs around building presentations that helped Presentations.ai to emerge as a competitive player even in the crowded space where both <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/20/prezent-ai-secures-20m-to-gamify-deck-presentations/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">startups</a> and even <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/microsoft-launches-its-ai-presentation-coach-for-powerpoint/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">big tech companies</a> like Google and Microsoft are trying to ease presentation-building using generative AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Because we have been doing this for so many years, I’m fairly confident that we are far ahead of anybody else, and the proof of the pudding for us is that a lot of users who come in pay us to use our software. They have typically tried other competitors, including whatever Google or Microsoft has,” Raghvendra asserted.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After gaining initial traction, the startup transitioned from a completely free experience for beta testers into a freemium offering in early 2024. Since then, Raghvendra told TechCrunch it has “tens of thousands” of paying users who pay for its service, starting at an annual price of $200 per user in the U.S., with different tiers and localized pricing across markets.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup utilizes “frontier” LLMs along with its own small language models created for specific tasks, such as deciding which chart best fits a particular topic. It also uses text-to-image models Flux and Stable Diffusion to help users quickly generate images to be used in the presentations with prompts.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Presentations.ai provides tools including theme palettes and presentation styles to generate decks based on user preferences. It also offers features including an AI-powered design assistant to create presentations based on different ideas, sharing and real-time sync, and multilingual support.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similarly, the startup provides brand templates to match the style of users’ particular brands. It also lets people export their presentations to a PowerPoint file for further editing or as a PDF.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Presentations.ai specifically includes “guardrails” to assure enterprise customers it has a high bar against the competition. These guardrails, Raghvendra said, are built using the data pipelines the startup has built over time to restrict hallucination, the colloquial term of AI-generated inaccurate or misleading content. The platform also lets enterprises restrict access to sensitive data they do not want to be shared with other users, such as the financial information with the CFO that the front-line staff should not access.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup also allows hosting a private instance of the software. Additionally, it provides organization-wide licenses to let employees collaborate on a particular presentation.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Raghvendra told TechCrunch the startup plans to use the seed funding to launch a dedicated presentation agent to create presentations within any application. It also plans to have an enterprise sales team.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, Raghvendra said the startup has spent “zero” on its marketing. Also, since it owns IPs, the executive said its AI patent costs are relatively lower and have higher profitability margins than other startups enabling presentations using AI.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup gets 20% of its revenues from the U.S. followed by India. It also counts the U.K., Germany, Australia, Canada, and the Middle East among its key markets. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The seed round included participation from learned Indian entrepreneurs including Paytm’s Vijay Shekhar Sharma, CRED’s Kunal Shah, Freshworks founder Girish Mathrubhootham, and RedBus’ Phanindra Sama, among others.</p>\n</div>",

TechCrunch has reached out to the FCC for more information.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Candeub has long been a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/washingtonbytes/2019/06/12/to-protect-free-speech-reform-section-230-dont-put-it-into-the-usmca/#30d15246ea23\" rel=\"nofollow\">vocal critic</a> of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. Section 230 protects tech companies and online service providers from prosecution based on what their users post on their platforms. The argument against repealing Section 230 is that tech entities, including social media companies, would become liable for what is posted on their platforms, which could lead to censorship.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2020, Candeub was one of the lead writers on an <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/27/administration-fcc-trump-crackdown-383330\" rel=\"nofollow\">administrative petition</a> that asked the FCC to get involved with the ongoing debates around social media content moderation. The debates were sparked after Donald Trump accused social media sites of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/section-230-hearing-big-tech/\">censoring conservative voices</a> after companies like X — Twitter at the time — moderated his inaccurate claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That attempt to curb Section 230’s power wasn’t successful. More recent challenges have also failed. In 2023, the Supreme Court took <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/18/supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-twitter-and-google-avoiding-the-issue-of-section-230-for-now/\">Google and Twitter’s</a> respective sides in adjacent cases that tried to hold the platforms accountable for allowing content from the Islamic State that promoted the terrorist organization.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The conversation around Section 230 was already likely to come up during this administration again. Candeub joins the FCC alongside recently appointed chairman Carr, who has already <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/trumps-fcc-pick-has-said-he-wants-to-ban-tiktok-challenge-section-230/\">been vocal</a> about hoping for changes to Section 230 during this administration.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Candeub previously served as an advisor to the FCC in the early 2000s. He joined the Trump Administration in 2019 as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Telecommunications and Information and <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2020/08/12/adam-candeub-commerce-telecom\" rel=\"nofollow\">also assumed the role</a> of Acting Assistant Secretary. He joined the Department of Justice as Deputy Associate Attorney General in the waning weeks of Trump’s presidency in late 2020. Candeub is currently a law professor at Michigan State University; he first joined its law faculty back in 2004.</p>\n\n</div>",

Kinly was <a href=\"https://www.bankingdive.com/news/greenwood-acquires-neobank-kinly-killer-mike-ryan-glover-fintech/649189/\" rel=\"nofollow\">sold in 2023 to Greenwood</a>, itself a digital banking platform for Black and Latino individuals and businesses. Kinly – formerly called First Boulevard and Tenth – had raised a total of about $20 million in funding from investors such as Gabrielle Union, Marshawn Lynch, Kevin Durant, Forerunners Ventures, Point72 Ventures, Barclays, Anthemis Group. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bradley is also a limited partner in venture funds, including Cowboy Ventures and Ganas Ventures, and sits on the investment committee of the <a href=\"https://www.captablecoalition.com/investor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cap Table Coalition</a>, a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/07/these-folks-are-working-to-bring-more-diversity-to-the-venture-lp-investing-pool/\">group</a> trying to pull in investors that have been historically left out of the investing process. Richie Serna, whose day job is CEO at payments startup (and Stripe competitor) Finix, helped build CTC. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stripe <a href=\"https://stripe.com/startups/partners\" rel=\"nofollow\">operates a startup partner program</a> in which it says it works with venture capital firms and startup accelerators “to bring exclusive Stripe benefits” to portfolio companies. In recent years, it has acquired a number of startups. Most recently, it announced it was in talks <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/stripe-in-talks-to-acquire-bridge-for-1-billion/\">to acquire stablecoin platform Bridge</a> for a whopping $1 billion. Last July, <strong> </strong>Stripe made its third acquisition in a 14-month period and at least the <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/stripe/company_financials\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">15th total</a> over its lifetime when it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/26/stripe-acquires-payment-processing-startup-lemon-squeezy/\">picked up 13-person Lemon Squeezy</a>, a merchant of record that calculated and paid global sales tax for digital products, handling legal processing and fees in every country. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Want more fintech news in your inbox?

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">It’s never been easier to create and publish art than it is now, and if you believe the companies building tech around AI, the production process is going to get even more efficient. That’s especially the case with video production, with companies of all sizes using large language models to build tools that let you whip up decent quality videos and animation with a few prompts and actions.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Popular tools in this space include Google’s Veo 2, OpenAI’s Sora, Runway, Luma AI, and Shanghai-based Hailuo. Now, a South Korean startup called <a href=\"https://www.cinamon.io/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Cinamon</a> is ramping up efforts to claim a part of this burgeoning market — it recently raised a $8.5 million Series B round to continue building its animated video generation platform “CINEV,” slated to be launched in beta in the first half of 2025. Altos Venture, an existing backer, as well as Saehan Venture Capital invested in this round. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cinamon’s pitch is that its platform provides a video generator that can let you build 3D environments, direct scenes and actions, place characters, edit camera angles, and more — all with text prompts and sliders. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to its CEO Doosun Hong, the company’s approach fundamentally differs from existing AI video generators, which create videos by generating pixels using text, images and videos as reference materials. In contrast, CINEV combines a 3D asset library, AI motion generation, and a filmmaking-focused large language model to first construct 3D scenes complete with characters and elements, and then lets you edit them using its suite of video production and editing tools. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2958425\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1472\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1714px) 100vw, 1714px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png 1714w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=150,129 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=300,258 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=768,660 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=680,584 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=1200,1031 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=1280,1099 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=430,369 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=720,618 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=900,773 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=800,687 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=1536,1319 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=668,574 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=437,375 437w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=718,617 718w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=618,531 618w\" width=\"1714\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Some of the video generation and editing tools in CINEV. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cinamon</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Cinamon</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our approach enables easier direction and editing without consistency/physics issues, making it particularly suitable for longer-form content like films and dramas,” Hong said. “We envision CINEV to be complementary to existing AI video tools, potentially enabling new workflows where CINEV’s output could serve as high-quality reference material for other AI video platforms.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cinamon started life in 2019 as Cinamon Games, a subsidiary of content production firm Vonvon. Cinamon initially set up a JV with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/24/can-korean-digital-storytelling-platforms-captivate-north-american-and-european-audiences/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NAVER WEBTOON</a>, a Korean digital storytelling platform, to create Maybe, an interactive storytelling app. Facing growing data privacy concerns, Vonvon merged with Cinamon Games later in 2019 to focus solely on storytelling in the social content space. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While its competitors like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/16/a-quibi-like-app-called-reelshort-hit-record-downloads-and-revenue-this-month/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Crazy Maple Studio</a> started offering animated interactive story apps, fiction apps, storytelling apps and short-form videos, Cinamon instead chose to focus on creating 3D animation tools that could speed up and scale animation production for content creators and studios. Even though it cost more investment than tools for 2D content, they saw greater scalability potential.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2022, the startup began building its 3D animation platform, and later integrated AI features to enhance production efficiency. In September that year, South Korean gaming company Krafton, Naver Z (a unit of Korean internet giant Naver), and SNOW, (a camera app run by Naver), invested $10 million in Cinamon’s Series A.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Going forwards, Cinamon plans to use its investors’ IPs and 3D assets to bolster its offering. Krafton has substantial intellectual property and 3D assets used in its Battleground games, while Naver Z operates the Zepeto metaverse platform. Cinamon says CINEV can help extend these IPs beyond gaming by enabling content creators to use these IPs, and potentially drive user acquisition for Krafton and NaverZ. Cinamon also entered Nvidia’s startup accelerator, <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Inception, last August</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our potential users include comic, manga, webtoon artists, web novel writers, game developers, video creators and traditional animators looking for easier workflows,” Hong said. “In 2025, we plan to focus on customers [ranging] from individual creators to content IP companies looking for easier, faster, cheaper ways to create Anime, VTuber, and cinematic video game content.”</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cinamon plans to use the new capital for hiring more AI engineers and for R&amp;D. The startup has a team of 60 staff with expertise in 3D graphics, AI, gaming, and content production. This Series B brings its total capital raised so far to $18.5 million (25 billion KRW).</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has pledged to make artificial general intelligence (AGI) — which is roughly defined as AI that can accomplish any task a human can — openly available one day. But in a <a href=\"https://ai.meta.com/static-resource/meta-frontier-ai-framework/?utm_source=newsroom&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_content=Frontier_AI_Framework_PDF&amp;utm_campaign=Our_Approach_to_Frontier_AI_blog\" rel=\"nofollow\">new policy document</a>, Meta suggests that there are certain scenarios in which it may not release a highly capable AI system it developed internally.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The document, which Meta is calling its Frontier AI Framework, identifies two types of AI systems the company considers too risky to release: “high risk” and “critical risk” systems. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Meta defines them, both “high-risk” and “critical-risk” systems are capable of aiding in cybersecurity, chemical, and biological attacks, the difference being that “critical-risk” systems could result in a “catastrophic outcome [that] cannot be mitigated in [a] proposed deployment context.” High-risk systems, by contrast, might make an attack easier to carry out but not as reliably or dependably as a critical risk system.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Which sort of attacks are we talking about here? Meta gives a few examples, like the “automated end-to-end compromise of a best-practice-protected corporate-scale environment” and the “proliferation of high-impact biological weapons.” The list of possible catastrophes in Meta’s document is far from exhaustive, the company acknowledges, but includes those that Meta believes to be “the most urgent” and plausible to arise as a direct result of releasing a powerful AI system.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Somewhat surprising is that, according to the document, Meta classifies system risk not based on any one empirical test but informed by the input of internal and external researchers who are subject to review by “senior-level decision-makers.” Why? Meta says that it doesn’t believe the science of evaluation is “sufficiently robust as to provide definitive quantitative metrics” for deciding a system’s riskiness.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If Meta determines a system is high-risk, the company says it will limit access to the system internally and won’t release it until it implements mitigations to “reduce risk to moderate levels.” If, on the other hand, a system is deemed critical-risk, Meta says it will implement unspecified security protections to prevent the system from being exfiltrated and stop development until the system can be made less dangerous.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta’s Frontier AI Framework, which the company says will evolve with the changing AI landscape, appears to be a response to criticism of the company’s “open” approach to system development. Meta has embraced a strategy of making its AI technology openly available — albeit <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/we-finally-have-an-official-definition-for-open-source-ai/\">not open source by the commonly understood definition</a> — in contrast to companies like OpenAI that opt to gate their systems behind an API. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Meta, the open release approach has proven to be a blessing and a curse. The company’s family of AI models, called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/06/meta-unveils-a-new-more-efficient-llama-model/\">Llama</a>, has racked up hundreds of millions downloads. But Llama has also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/meta-says-its-making-its-llama-models-available-for-us-national-security-applications/\">reportedly</a> been used by at least one U.S. adversary to develop a defense chatbot. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In publishing its Frontier AI Framework, Meta may also be aiming to contrast its open AI strategy with Chinese AI firm DeepSeek’s. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/deepseek-the-countries-and-agencies-that-have-banned-the-ai-companys-tech/\">DeepSeek</a> also makes its systems openly available. But the company’s AI has few safeguards and can be easily steered to <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/01/31/harmful-and-toxic-output-deepseek-has-major-security-and-safety-gaps-study-warns\" rel=\"nofollow\">generate toxic and harmful outputs</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[W]e believe that by considering both benefits and risks in making decisions about how to develop and deploy advanced AI,” Meta writes in the document, “it is possible to deliver that technology to society in a way that preserves the benefits of that technology to society while also maintaining an appropriate level of risk.”</p>\n</div>",
