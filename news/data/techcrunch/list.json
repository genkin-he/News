Breaches of the law’s rules on prohibited use-cases can attract the stiffest penalties: up to 7% of global turnover (or €35 million, whichever is greater).</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The guidelines are designed to ensure the consistent, effective, and uniform application of the AI Act across the European Union,” the Commission wrote in a <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/commission-publishes-guidelines-prohibited-artificial-intelligence-ai-practices-defined-ai-act\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>. However it acknowledged that the guidance it has produced is not legally binding — it will, ultimately, be up to regulators and courts to enforce and adjudicate the AI Act. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The guidelines provide legal explanations and practical examples to help stakeholders understand and comply with the AI Act’s requirements,” the Commission added, saying the initiative “underscores [its] commitment to fostering a safe and ethical AI landscape”. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The guidelines — which can be <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/redirection/document/112367\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">downloaded here</a> — have been published today in draft form. This is because formal adoption and application remains pending as the EU still needs to produce translations in the bloc’s myriad official languages. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the AI Act <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/01/the-eus-ai-act-is-now-in-force/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">became law across the region last year</a> its implementation continues, with additional compliance deadlines set to kick in over the coming months and years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enforcement is likely to be further staggered — even in the case of the prohibited use-cases — since EU Member States have until August 2 to designate the bodies responsible for overseeing the rulebook.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> </p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Autonomous vehicle company Cruise is laying off 50% of its workforce — cuts that extend to the CEO and several other top executives — as it prepares to shut down operations. What remains of Cruise will move under parent company General Motors as the automaker directs its resources towards improving  its hands-free driver assistance system Super Cruise — and eventually rolls out personal autonomous vehicles. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The layoffs were announced by Craig Glidden, Cruise’s president and chief administrative officer, according to a companywide email that TechCrunch has viewed and verified with sources. Individuals who were affected received a separate email from Cruise Chief Human Resources Officer Nilka Thomas.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The layoffs come nearly two months after GM said it would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/11/gm-is-giving-up-on-cruise-robotaxis-pivots-to-personal-autonomous-vehicles/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">no longer fund the development</a> of a commercial robotaxi business and would instead focus on building personal autonomous vehicle technology. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CEO Marc Whitten will depart from Cruise this week, along with Thomas, chief safety officer Steve Kenner, and global head of public policy Rob Grant.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mo Elshenawy, Cruise’s chief technologist, will stay on through the end of April to help with the transition. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear exactly how many employees are affected, but two sources at Cruise estimate the company’s current headcount at around 2,100 based on the number of members on a Slack channel for company announcements. That means more than 1,000 employees might have been impacted by the layoffs.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to Cruise for more information. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sources at the company told TechCrunch they haven’t been given details on severance yet, but per an email from Thomas, they will remain on the company’s payroll through April 5 and benefits through the end of April. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The automaker expects to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/gm-expects-to-save-up-to-1-billion-on-cruise-costs/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">save up to $1 billion annually</a> by ending its Cruise robotaxi development program., according to details shared during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call. At the time, CFO Paul Jacobson said the projected cost savings were based on the assumption that “Cruise employees will be fully integrated into GM by mid-year.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In mid-January, Cruise management started to extend retention offers to employees, almost all of whom were engineers, according to sources familiar with the matter. In an email to Cruise employees, CEO Marc Whitten indicated that next steps would come after the Cruise board met. That meeting happened on Monday, according to one source. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Cruise employees were initially <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/11/cruise-employees-blindsided-by-gms-plan-to-end-robotaxi-program/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blindsided</a> by GM’s decision to pull the plug on the robotaxi development program, they have been expecting such an announcement for weeks. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sources who spoke to TechCrunch said they have been hardly working and in a state of limbo since GM’s announcement as they awaited next steps. On Monday afternoon, Glidden sent a Slack message to employees saying that he expects to share “some news regarding the transition plans tomorrow” and advised staffers to “plan on working from home.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Thank you for your patience during this time – we know the uncertainty has been difficult but you have navigated the past weeks with grace and professionalism,” Glidden wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Glidden had previously served as GM’s executive vice president of legal and policy, but the automaker assigned him his role at Cruise <a href=\"https://www.getcruise.com/news/blog/2023/important-updates-from-cruise/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">in November 2023</a>, following a Cruise safety incident that led to the company’s downfall. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On October 2, 2023, a Cruise robotaxi ran over a pedestrian who had been flung into its path by a human-driven vehicle. The robotaxi then dragged the pedestrian, who was stuck under the car, some 20 feet as it attempted a pullover maneuver. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cruise officials did not immediately share that relevant bit of information with authorities, and when it was revealed, California’s Department of Motor Vehicles and Public Utilities Commission<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/24/dmv-immediately-suspends-cruises-robotaxi-permit-in-california/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> immediately suspended</a> the company’s permits to operate. Cruise then grounded its entire robotaxi fleet across the U.S., and much of its leadership team stepped down, including co-founder and CEO Kyle Vogt. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After installing new leadership, including a permanent Chief Safety Officer, Cruise was gearing up for a relaunch at the start of this year in Austin. The company had spent much of 2024 testing in Phoenix, Dallas, Houston, and the Bay Area and beefing out its safety systems. Two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch the company had been ready to implement a retrofitted sensor solution internally referred to as Project Rhino that would have solved for the October 2 incident by creating additional visibility and awareness underneath the car.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In June 2024, GM injected another $850 million into Cruise, bringing its total spend on the company since acquiring most of Cruise’s shares in 2016 close to $10 billion. In September, Mo Elshenawy, president and chief technologist of Cruise, threw a huge party for Cruise staffers that some read to be a sign that the company was moving forward. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story is developing …</em></p>\n</div>",

            "title": "How Max Altschuler accidentally founded a VC firm that just raised another $54M",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Four years after accidentally launching a VC firm, GTMfund founder and general partner Max Altschuler has raised a second $54 million fund. He was aiming for $50 million. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GTMfund is one of a rising crop of “operator led” funds, meaning the limited partner investors are people who have worked, or are currently working, at successful tech companies (known in VC parlance as “operators”).  </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They are, for the most part, active at their current company, or maybe just finished a run at a company that went from zero to a couple hundred million in revenue,” Altschuler tells TechCrunch. The LPs include people from places like AWS, OpenAI, Procore, Rippling, and Snowflake, he says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These LPs are largely marketing and sales experts, known in Silicon Valley-speak as “go to market,” hence the name GTMfund. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to contributing their cash, LPs also help mentor the portfolio companies in sales strategies — an area where many startups need help — and with hiring salespeople. They also help the fund find and evaluate young startups companies worth investing in.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first fund, launched in 2021, had about 250 operators and just a couple of institutional investors. It backed companies like AI composer Writer (valued at $1.9 <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/generative-ai-startup-writer-raises-200m-at-a-1-9b-valuation/\">billion in its last raise in November</a>), AI data center tech Atlan (that last raised $105 million at a $750 million valuation), and security compliance Vanta (last raised $150 million at $2.45 billion), among others.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With that track record, Fund II attracted 300 operator LPs, as well as six institutions including Bain Capital Ventures, HarbourVest, Inovia Capital, and Franklin Park.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And Altschuler finds himself swept into leading a rising emerging fund. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That wasn’t actually his initial intention. Altschuler was once employee No. 8 at Udemy, running sales through its early days. He later helped with startup community SaaStr and advised for a few startups, then launched his own blog called Sales Hacker, which he sold to Outreach in 2018 (though he has since bought it back). He began to angel invest, writing early checks for Gong and Carbon Health. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">People in Altschuler’s considerable network kept asking him to show them how to angel invest. So he decided to try doing that.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He emailed a list of GTM people and shared an idea: “What if we raised a million dollars between 20 to 50 of us and put it into 10 companies and then meaningfully supported those companies?” he suggested. “And it went gangbusters. We ended up raising $22 million for Fund I.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LPs in the fund can opt to do as much or as little as they want to assist, from silent investing to being highly involved with portfolio companies. GTMfund has also built out community functions: like a deal flow channel where LPs can chat; and it hosts six dinners a year as well as an annual retreat.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s become, for me, just a labor of love. It’s a lot of fun,” he said. “I’m getting the same out of it as our LPs are. I love working with all these different founders, all these different companies to help them on this kind of niche topic of GTM.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GTMfund’s structure as an operator fund isn’t common, but it also isn’t unheard-of. For instance, Mallun Yen founded Operator Collective in 2019, which launched out of the gate with $45 million, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/20/operator-collective-was-early-to-bring-on-operators-as-lps-now-its-doubling-down/\">raised a second $92 million in 2022</a> and also has an enviable portfolio. Another more recent example is Ashley Mayer’s Coalition which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/28/coalition-wants-to-make-more-women-operators-and-investors-at-the-same-damn-time/\">launched in 2022 with $12.5 million</a>. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for GTMfund’s second fund, Altschuler says the goal is to back about 40 early-stage companies at pre-seed, seed, and the occasional Series A — with check sizes of between half a million and $1.5 million.</p>\n</div>",

The first feature, dubbed Commissioned Digital Remarques, allows creators to add personalized sketches and signatures to digital comics. The second, Unlimited Digital Covers, expands platform-wide access to alternative comic book covers.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Commissioned Digital Remarques brings the tradition of in-person comic customization into the digital realm. At conventions, waiting in line for an artist’s sketch or signature is a major part of the fan experience. In the comics world, a remarque is a small sketch or doodle made on a book’s cover or pages, often integrating with existing artwork. The sketches are less time-intensive than full character illustrations but still highly valued by collectors.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In DSTLRY’s take on things, it’s the creators who set both the price and turnaround time. Like the books themselves, once a digital comic is remarqued, users can then turn around and sell or trade the remarqued issues on DSTLRY.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When former Comixology executives, David Steinberger and Chip Mosher, first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/13/comixology-vets-return-with-their-own-publishing-company/\">announced the company in 2023</a>, collectability was a tentpole feature. Forced scarcity in the form of limited editions has been deeply engrained in comics for decades now. While Steinberger and Mosher were quick to note that DSTLRY would never be an NFT marketplace, limited editions still play a major role in its built-in comics marketplace — and business model.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Variant covers – when a publisher releases multiple covers for a single issue — have played a key role in comic book collectability for decades. The phenomenon took off during the 1990s comics speculator boom, when things like holograms and holofoil were all the rage. While the bottom has fallen out of the market in the intervening decades, collectors still play a major role in the ecosystem.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new Unlimited Digital Covers feature means that both the main and alternative covers remain in digital circulation for the life of the book. Some scarcity will remain, however. Along with remarques, “collectible variants” are available for a single week after the book’s release. After that, users have to buy or trade for them in the DSTLRY Marketplace.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, all products bought and sold through the site’s built-in secondary market continue to generate royalties for creators. That’s a key difference between the DSTLRY model and the traditional resale market, wherein artists and writers don’t get a cut when back issues are sold.</p>\n\n</div>",

With Invites, users can create and share invitations on their iPhone, RSVP, contribute to Shared Albums, and curate event soundtracks.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To create an invitation, you need an iCloud+ subscription. However, anyone can RSVP, regardless of whether they have an Apple Account or Apple device.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When creating an invitation, users can select a photo from their library or pick one from the app’s gallery. The app integrates with Maps and Weather to give guests directions to the event and to notify them about the forecast for that day.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Participants can contribute photos and videos to a dedicated Shared Album within each invite as a way to save their memories and relive the event at a later time. A collaborative playlist feature lets Apple Music subscribers create a soundtrack for the event that guests can access right from the invite.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, users can create unique event invitations using Apple’s Image Playground to produce original images for invites. Plus, users can leverage Apple Intelligence’s Writing Tools to compose invitations. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hosts can view and manage their events, share invitations with a link, and review RSVPs. They have to option to select which details to show in an invite preview, such as the event background or a home address.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the other hand, guests can view and respond to an invitation through the app or on the web. Attendees can control how their information shows up to others, and they have the option to leave or report events.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With Apple Invites, an event comes to life from the moment the invitation is created, and users can share lasting memories even after they get together,” said Brent Chiu-Watson, Apple’s senior director of Worldwide Product Marketing for Apps and iCloud in <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/introducing-apple-invites-a-new-app-that-brings-people-together/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">a press release</a>. “Apple Invites brings together capabilities our users already know and love across iPhone, iCloud, and Apple Music, making it easy to plan special events.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple Invites is available for free on the App Store for all iPhone models running iOS 18 or later and can be accessed on the web at <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/invites/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">icloud.com/invites</a>.</p>\n</div>",

According to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-lieutenant-gsa-ai-agency/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a report</a> from Wired citing multiple sources, the Musk ally described the plan to run the office like a “startup software company” during a Monday meeting.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/technology/musk-allies-ai-government.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">notes</a> that the cost-cutting measure arrives as the department is said to be eyeing a 50% budget cut. The paper adds that Shedd is looking to build a centralized government contract database designed for AI analysis. Such a strategy sits comfortably at the intersection of smaller government and increased AI reliance advocated by the Silicon Valley investors and executives rising through the government ranks under the Trump administration.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The TTS is a division of the General Services Administration that helps federal agencies improve their tech practices.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",
