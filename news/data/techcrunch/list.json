In its latest earnings report, Alphabet <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/snippet/2960051/alphabet-brushes-off-deepseek-fears-with-mammoth-75b-capex-spend/\">announced</a> it would boost capital expenditures to $75 billion — a whopping 42% increase — to accelerate its AI progress.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alphabet is betting that cheaper AI will massively boost demand for its services, rather than making it basically free and threatening its business models. The company noted it stands to benefit from this rise in usage — known as inference — thanks to its billions of existing users.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Part of the reason we are so excited about the AI opportunity is we know we can drive extraordinary use cases because the cost of actually using it is going to keep coming down, which will make more use cases feasible,” Pichai said during the earnings call. “And that’s the opportunity space. It’s as big as it comes, and that’s why you’re seeing us invest to meet that moment.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/29/zuck-shrugs-off-deepseek-vows-to-spend-hundreds-of-billions-on-ai/\">similar comments</a> in Meta’s earnings call last week, pledging to spend “hundreds of billions” on AI in the long term despite all the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/how-deepseek-changed-silicon-valleys-ai-landscape/\">DeepSeek buzz.</a></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether this all pans out is unclear, but for now, tech giants can afford the AI bills, and when (or if) they’ll slow down is anyone’s guess.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">On a clear spring evening in Michigan, the stars aligned — just not in the way Upfront Ventures partner Nick Kim expected.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He’d just led <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/06/oursky-lands-9-5m-seed-to-build-out-developer-platform-for-space-data/\">a $9.5 million seed round</a> for OurSky, a software platform for space observational data, and was eager to see what its telescope partner PlaneWave Instruments could do. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But when they rolled out the telescopes that night at PlaneWave’s manufacturing facility, he was stuck waiting. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It took them quite a long time to get the first image. I’m talking like, multiple hours. And these are the people who make the telescopes! They were using all this, like, off-the-shelf, open source software that they kind of cobbled together,”  Kim said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kim wasn’t upset, though. He was excited. “This is why OurSky needed to exist, right? This is the problem,” he remembered thinking. “What a perfect match.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was such a good match that, now, OurSky and PlaneWave are merging to create a new company called <a href=\"https://observable.space/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Observable Space</a>. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OurSky founder Dan Roelker and PlaneWave founder Richard Hedrick say this will make the telescopes easier to use. And they also believe the tighter integration will open up new markets — especially as they leverage their position as the only U.S.-based telescope manufacturer. They already count NASA, the U.S. Space Force, and Georgia State University’s Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy as customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My dream was to integrate all the components on the telescope, even the parts we don’t sell, and then integrate the control of the telescope,” Hedrick said in an interview. “It was very obvious for us to be working together.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Roelker, who was SpaceX’s VP of software engineering from 2015 to 2019, said telescope users have to deal with what he called a “mash of integration bullsh–.” PlaneWave’s vertical strategy combined with OurSky’s software will eliminate those headaches, he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Solving that integration problem is an opportunity for Observable Space to grow the market, Roelker said. (The platform OurSky has built will continue on in that name, and the telescopes will continue to be sold under the PlaneWave brand.)</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That can involve a number of things, like letting users tap multiple telescopes at a single site — or even around the world — to mimic the capabilities of a much larger telescope, or sending communications to and from space via laser, all while lowering cost.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Squeezing more out of his high-quality telescopes sold Hedrick on the merger. It will make the tech more approachable and affordable for enthusiasts and institutions alike.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hedrick said one of those institutions recently designed some one-meter telescopes and had them custom-built by someone else. “And they were like, ‘God, if you had existed, we never would have done that,’” he said.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-new-business\">New business</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the cost to get to orbit shrinks, more companies are sending things to space, Roelker said. That means there is increased demand for the ability to locate and track objects orbiting the Earth, communicate with spacecraft, and enable defense and intelligence applications. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Observable Space can be a key player in that new economy, according to Mislav Tolusic, managing partner at dual-use venture fund Marlinspike, which has invested in Observable Space.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Every day you’re relying on space,” Tolusic said in an interview. “If you take out GPS constellations, we’re in trouble economically. It’s a big, big, big deal. A lot of systems stop functioning. And guess what? The future is going to be even more dependent on that infrastructure.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tolusic praised PlaneWave’s quality, and noted Hedrick built up the company at a time when basically all telescope manufacturing is overseas — which he believes is an advantage. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you want to replicate that [in the U.S.], you have to go figure out how to make those fine lenses, how to make gimbals — and not just how to design them but how to spit them out by the thousands,” he said.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jordan Noone, general partner at Embedded Ventures, explained his fund’s investment with a specific example of what OurSky and PlaneWave can do as a combined company. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shortly before the merger, Noone was at Mount Wilson Observatory in Los Angeles for a demo of the companies’ products working together. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He told TechCrunch that the teams pulled an observation request from the queue on OurSky’s platform: a satellite operator had lost radio contact with its spacecraft. The OurSky and PlaneWave teams located it quickly. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What he described was a much smoother experience than Kim’s demo in Michigan, and served as proof in his mind that Observable Space was a good bet to make. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Many of the world’s most valuable companies, like Apple, Nvidia — they’re hardware/software platform combos,” Noone said. “Companies that approach just one of those two can have a lot of inherent value, but the combination of both in today’s world is extremely powerful.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-star-wars-or-star-trek\">Star Wars or Star Trek?</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Observable Space has about 100 employees, with the manufacturing operations remaining in Michigan, some engineering happening in Los Angeles, California, and an observatory outside Washington, D.C. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s already revenue-generating, and the combined company has raised $11 million to date, including funding from In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s nonprofit strategic investment arm.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hedrick and Roelker said the two companies have fit together easily, since they were both focused on such different businesses and didn’t have massive back-office operations.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Going through the merger process itself was actually really valuable, because when you’re going through it, a lot of issues pop up,” Roelker said. “You actually get a really good sense of how you’re going to work together. And I think both Rick and I felt really good about that, because we actually went through some really hard things during the merger.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked, the pair did not describe those “hard things,” and Hedrick instead quipped: “We had to decide on whether [the company] was going to be Star Wars or Star Trek.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The answer?</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Battlestar Galactica,” Roelker said.</p>\n</div>",

I would say that the overall environment of uncertainty is benefiting our business,” he said on the call.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Among the appealing features that attract users to Snapchat is Spotlight, which serves as the company’s alternative to TikTok. Many creators are already on the platform, and more will likely join if TikTok goes offline in the U.S. again. Over the past year, Snap has onboarded thousands of creators into its Snap Star program, and the number of creators posting content grew by more than 40% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, says the company.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spiegel also highlighted the growth of Snapchat’s public content. He added, “I think in Q4 we actually reached a billion public posts a month on Snapchat. So the public content ecosystem is growing in a really nice and healthy way, and so we’re just going to continue our focus there when it comes to our strategy and participation.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the fourth quarter, the company reported that it reached 453 million daily active users, an increase of 39 million from the previous period. Snap reported a revenue of $1.55 billion, up from $1.36 billion the previous year.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The uncertainty surrounding TikTok has not only benefited Snap but has also affected the broader social media landscape, with several apps, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/xiaohongshu-rednote-chinas-answer-to-instagram-hits-no-1-on-the-app-store-as-tiktok-faces-us-shutdown/\">including the Chinese-owned RedNote</a>, YouTube, and Meta seeing boosts in user engagement. </p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">As a university student, Dalton Signor was troubled by how many people around him smoked or vaped, including his grandmother and 14-year-old sister.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Signor (pictured center) felt that existing smoking cessation medicines, whether patches, gums, or lozenges, are not very effective because they take too long to start working. “They take about 30 minutes to provide relief, but the average person relapses in 11 minutes,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, three years ago, he set out to develop a withdrawal-inhibitor inhaler because delivering medication directly to the lungs allows for rapid absorption into the bloodstream, providing faster relief. He dropped out of the university to work on this problem, creating Miist Therapeutics, attracting Jeff Schuster (pictured left), a physicist who has<a href=\"https://patents.justia.com/inventor/jeffrey-a-schuster?page=3\" rel=\"nofollow\"> dozens of patents</a> for developing inhaled medicines, as CTO and co-founder, and his long-term friend and biomedical engineer Eric Ezerins (pictured right) as head of R&amp;D.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Three years after launching, Miist announced it secured $7 million in seed funding from investors including Refactor Capital, 1517 Fund, and Freeflow Ventures.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Refractor’s solo GP Zal Bilmoria said he initially wasn’t convinced that Miist’s approach would be effective. But when Signor presented him with the results of the company’s Phase I trial, the former Andreessen Horowitz partner who helped launch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/18/zal-bilimoria-refactor-capital-venture-capital/\">that firm’s first Bio Fund</a>, instantly changed his mind.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The small study showed that smokers who used Miist’s inhaler eliminated 92% of their cravings in only two minutes, a 10X improvement over the existing standard of care. “It’s game-changing,” Bilmoria said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Signor explained that Miist’s technology produces particles that are 50% smaller than other inhalers, which means the medicine is deposited deeper in the lungs, where the lining is just one cell thick, leading to faster absorption into the bloodstream.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Miist calls its invention an inhaler, it looks and acts like a vaping device. Signor said that its vape-like properties may help with the psychological aspects of quitting.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When people quit, they miss taking the five-minute smoke break and like having that part of their day to themselves,” he said, adding that even though the medicine could be delivered in one inhalation, Miist chose to spread it out over seven puffs to mimic the behaviour of smoking.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2959994\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1280\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=708,472 708w\" style=\"width:934px;height:auto\" width=\"1920\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Miist</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nicotine addiction is not the only health issue where rapid release makes a big difference.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company recently launched a program for migraines. For someone in the throes of a migraine the difference between fast-acting and slow-absorbing medication can be significant. It not only provides faster relief, but can also help avert a much longer, untreatable attack.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although several nasal inhaler formulations of migraine drugs currently exist, Miist anticipates that its oral inhaler will be more effective.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Miist is gearing up to run a Phase II trial of its smoking cessation tech that uses the active ingredient in standard nicotine replacement therapy, like Nicorette. It is also currently testing triptans, a class of migraine drugs, in the lab, Signor said. Signor envisions that the inhaler can one day also be used to administer other medicines for other conditions, such as anxiety control.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Miist is not the only startup developing a vape-like device for smoking cessation and migraines. Qnovia has raised over $35 million at an estimated $350 million valuation from investors including Blue Ledge Capital, DG Ventures, and Vice Venture,<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2024/10/25/qnovia-respirx-nicotine-replacement-therapy-nrt-new-device-to-quit-smoking/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Forbes reported</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Qnovia, like Miist, needs FDA clearance before selling its device in the US. If approved, they will be the first prescription-approved smoking cessation treatment to come to market in <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5347897/#:~:text=On%2011%20May%202006%2C%20the,had%20experienced%20suicidal%20behaviour%202.\" rel=\"nofollow\">nearly two decades</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some may view vaping as an unorthodox method of drug delivery. However, Refractor’s Bilmoria believes that its effectiveness should override people’s reservations.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s unbelievable to me that the pharma industry has overlooked this opportunity,” he said.</p>\n</div>",

The change was first spotted by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-04/google-removes-language-on-weapons-from-public-ai-principles\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bloomberg</a>. The company appears to have updated its public AI principles page, erasing a section titled “applications we will not pursue,” which was <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250130075626/https://ai.google/responsibility/principles/\" rel=\"nofollow\">still included</a> as recently as last week.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asked for comment, the company pointed TechCrunch to <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/ai/responsible-ai-2024-report-ongoing-work/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a new blog post</a> on “responsible AI.” It notes, in part, “we believe that companies, governments, and organizations sharing these values should work together to create AI that protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security.”</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s <a href=\"https://ai.google/responsibility/principles/\" rel=\"nofollow\">newly updated AI principles</a> note the company will work to “mitigate unintended or harmful outcomes and avoid unfair bias,” as well as align the company with “widely accepted principles of international law and human rights.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In recent years, Google’s contracts to provide the U.S. and Israeli militaries with cloud services have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/18/google-fires-28-employees-after-sit-in-protest-over-controversial-project-nimbus-contract-with-israe/\">sparked internal protests from employees</a>. The company has maintained that its AI is not used to harm humans, however, the Pentagon’s AI chief recently told TechCrunch that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/19/the-pentagon-says-ai-is-speeding-up-its-kill-chain/\">some company’s AI models are speeding up the U.S. military’s kill chain.</a></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

We have a zero-tolerance policy against such targeting and will terminate our relationship with any customer that violates our terms of service.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These comments come after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/whatsapp-says-it-disrupted-a-hacking-campaign-targeting-journalists-with-spyware/\">WhatsApp alleged on Friday that Paragon’s spyware was used in a hacking campaign</a> that targeted around 90 journalists and other members of civil society. Since then, at least two people have come forward claiming they were among the targets: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/journalist-targeted-on-whatsapp-by-paragon-spyware-i-feel-violated/\">Italian journalist Francesco Cancellato</a>, and Sweden-based Libyan activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/03/critic-of-italy-libya-migration-pact-told-he-was-target-of-israeli-spyware\" rel=\"nofollow\">Husam El Gomati</a>. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fleming did not respond to a series of specific questions, including asking for more details about who Paragon considers to be a U.S. ally and a democracy; what exactly its terms of service say about the prohibition of targeting journalists and members of civil society with its spyware; whether the company can and does investigate allegations of abuse, such as those made by WhatsApp; whether the company is investigating WhatsApp’s allegations; and if Paragon has ever terminated a contract because of such violations.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\"> </p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about Paragon Solutions?

Thanks to undercover video recordings of members of the “Gioventù Meloniana,” Fanpage showed that a number of them made racist and antisemitic remarks, used the N-word, and chanted Nazi and pro-Italian dictator Benito Mussolini slogans. The investigation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/27/italy-fascist-chants-national-youth\" rel=\"nofollow\">prompted opposition parties</a> to criticize Meloni. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I feel violated,” Cancellato, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/journalist-targeted-on-whatsapp-by-paragon-spyware-i-feel-violated/\">who spoke of learning that his phone was targeted</a>, told TechCrunch. “You ask yourself, why me?

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Cybersecurity company SailPoint is hoping to go public — again. This time, the company plans to sell $1 billion worth of stock and hit an $11.5 billion valuation in its planned IPO.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s how the math works out for a proposed offering it <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250204490452/en/SailPoint-Announces-Launch-of-Initial-Public-Offering\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> Tuesday of 47.5 million shares, at between $19 to $21.  SailPoint’s owner, Thoma Bravo, plans to also sell 2.5 million shares.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SailPoint offers identity management wares to enterprises and is a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/okta-lays-off-180-employees-nearly-one-year-after-last-workforce-reduction/\">competitor to $16 billion market-cap Okta</a>. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t Sailpoint’s first time as a public company. It was publicly traded until Thoma Bravo took SailPoint private in 2022, valuing it at $6.9 billion at the time. The private equity giant will still own over 87% of the company after the IPO.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2030781/000119312525019604/d885522ds1a.htm#rom885522_7\" rel=\"nofollow\">said in its S-1 filing</a> that it’s on track for $813 annual recurring revenue, as of October. SailPoint reported annual net losses of just over $395 million on about $700 million in revenues as of January 2024; the company said it has more than $1 billion in debt, with its balance sheet showing debt of $1.5 billion. SailPoint said it will use the proceeds to address its debt, as well as fund operations.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the financial sophistication of SailPoint’s owners, the stock may very price above that range, and easily bypass that hoped-for cash haul and valuation.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founder Mark McClain, who stayed on as CEO after Thoma Bravo acquired the company, still has a relatively tiny stake of just over 3.6 million shares. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Not many founding CEOs find themselves in a position to introduce their company to the public market for a second time, but I am grateful to be able to do precisely that,” he remarked in his <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2030781/000119312525019604/d885522ds1a.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">prospectus letter</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because SailPoint isn’t a startup, this IPO, which could happen next week, won’t be a boon for any venture capitalists. But the success of the offering will be closely watched by them. VCs and startups are still reading the tea leaves on the timing to bring <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/01/here-are-all-the-ipos-reported-to-be-in-the-works-for-2025/\">their many IPO-ready tech startups public</a>. Should retail investors gobble the stock, this will be another signal that 2025 could be a good year to not just open a window, but a door.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then again, even if investors are hungry for this IPO, other factors could slow other offerings. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stock-market-stocks-djia-dow-jones-sp500-trump-tariffs-impact/plan\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wall Street grew plenty nervous</a> over the Trump Administration’s plans to start a North America tariff trade war, although those plans have now been postponed for at least a month. Should policy events keep rattling the markets, tech startups may just continue to stay under cover. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",
