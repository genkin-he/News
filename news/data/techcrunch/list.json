            "title": "Cruise to slash workforce by 50% after GM cuts funding to robotaxi operations",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Autonomous vehicle company Cruise is laying off 50% of its workforce — cuts that extend to the CEO and several other top executives — as it prepares to shut down operations. What remains of Cruise will move under parent company General Motors as the automaker directs its resources towards improving  its hands-free driver assistance system Super Cruise — and eventually rolls out personal autonomous vehicles. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The layoffs were announced by Craig Glidden, Cruise’s president and chief administrative officer, according to a companywide email that TechCrunch has viewed and verified with sources. Individuals who were affected received a separate email from Cruise Chief Human Resources Officer Nilka Thomas.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The layoffs come nearly two months after GM said it would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/11/gm-is-giving-up-on-cruise-robotaxis-pivots-to-personal-autonomous-vehicles/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">no longer fund the development</a> of a commercial robotaxi business and would instead focus on building personal autonomous vehicle technology. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CEO Marc Whitten will depart from Cruise this week, along with Thomas, chief safety officer Steve Kenner, and global head of public policy Rob Grant.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mo Elshenawy, Cruise’s chief technologist, will stay on through the end of April to help with the transition. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear exactly how many employees are affected, but two sources at Cruise estimate the company’s current headcount at around 2,100 based on the number of members on a Slack channel for company announcements. That means more than 1,000 employees might have been impacted by the layoffs.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to Cruise for more information. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sources at the company told TechCrunch they haven’t been given details on severance yet, but per an email from Thomas, they will remain on the company’s payroll through April 5 and benefits through the end of April. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The automaker expects to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/gm-expects-to-save-up-to-1-billion-on-cruise-costs/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">save up to $1 billion annually</a> by ending its Cruise robotaxi development program., according to details shared during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call. At the time, CFO Paul Jacobson said the projected cost savings were based on the assumption that “Cruise employees will be fully integrated into GM by mid-year.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In mid-January, Cruise management started to extend retention offers to employees, almost all of whom were engineers, according to sources familiar with the matter. In an email to Cruise employees, CEO Marc Whitten indicated that next steps would come after the Cruise board met. That meeting happened on Monday, according to one source. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Cruise employees were initially <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/11/cruise-employees-blindsided-by-gms-plan-to-end-robotaxi-program/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blindsided</a> by GM’s decision to pull the plug on the robotaxi development program, they have been expecting such an announcement for weeks. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sources who spoke to TechCrunch said they have been hardly working and in a state of limbo since GM’s announcement as they awaited next steps. On Monday afternoon, Glidden sent a Slack message to employees saying that he expects to share “some news regarding the transition plans tomorrow” and advised staffers to “plan on working from home.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Thank you for your patience during this time – we know the uncertainty has been difficult but you have navigated the past weeks with grace and professionalism,” Glidden wrote. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Glidden had previously served as GM’s executive vice president of legal and policy, but the automaker assigned him his role at Cruise <a href=\"https://www.getcruise.com/news/blog/2023/important-updates-from-cruise/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">in November 2023</a>, following a Cruise safety incident that led to the company’s downfall. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On October 2, 2023, a Cruise robotaxi ran over a pedestrian who had been flung into its path by a human-driven vehicle. The robotaxi then dragged the pedestrian, who was stuck under the car, some 20 feet as it attempted a pullover maneuver. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cruise officials did not immediately share that relevant bit of information with authorities, and when it was revealed, California’s Department of Motor Vehicles and Public Utilities Commission<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/24/dmv-immediately-suspends-cruises-robotaxi-permit-in-california/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> immediately suspended</a> the company’s permits to operate. Cruise then grounded its entire robotaxi fleet across the U.S., and much of its leadership team stepped down, including co-founder and CEO Kyle Vogt. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After installing new leadership, including a permanent Chief Safety Officer, Cruise was gearing up for a relaunch at the start of this year in Austin. The company had spent much of 2024 testing in Phoenix, Dallas, Houston, and the Bay Area and beefing out its safety systems. Two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch the company had been ready to implement a retrofitted sensor solution internally referred to as Project Rhino that would have solved for the October 2 incident by creating additional visibility and awareness underneath the car.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In June 2024, GM injected another $850 million into Cruise, bringing its total spend on the company since acquiring most of Cruise’s shares in 2016 close to $10 billion. In September, Mo Elshenawy, president and chief technologist of Cruise, threw a huge party for Cruise staffers that some read to be a sign that the company was moving forward. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story is developing …</em></p>\n</div>",

            "title": "How Max Altschuler accidentally founded a VC firm that just raised another $54M",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Four years after accidentally launching a VC firm, GTMfund founder and general partner Max Altschuler has raised a second $54 million fund. He was aiming for $50 million. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GTMfund is one of a rising crop of “operator led” funds, meaning the limited partner investors are people who have worked, or are currently working, at successful tech companies (known in VC parlance as “operators”).  </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They are, for the most part, active at their current company, or maybe just finished a run at a company that went from zero to a couple hundred million in revenue,” Altschuler tells TechCrunch. The LPs include people from places like AWS, OpenAI, Procore, Rippling, and Snowflake, he says.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These LPs are largely marketing and sales experts, known in Silicon Valley-speak as “go to market,” hence the name GTMfund. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to contributing their cash, LPs also help mentor the portfolio companies in sales strategies — an area where many startups need help — and with hiring salespeople. They also help the fund find and evaluate young startups companies worth investing in.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first fund, launched in 2021, had about 250 operators and just a couple of institutional investors. It backed companies like AI composer Writer (valued at $1.9 <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/generative-ai-startup-writer-raises-200m-at-a-1-9b-valuation/\">billion in its last raise in November</a>), AI data center tech Atlan (that last raised $105 million at a $750 million valuation), and security compliance Vanta (last raised $150 million at $2.45 billion), among others.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With that track record, Fund II attracted 300 operator LPs, as well as six institutions including Bain Capital Ventures, HarbourVest, Inovia Capital, and Franklin Park.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And Altschuler finds himself swept into leading a rising emerging fund. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That wasn’t actually his initial intention. Altschuler was once employee No. 8 at Udemy, running sales through its early days. He later helped with startup community SaaStr and advised for a few startups, then launched his own blog called Sales Hacker, which he sold to Outreach in 2018 (though he has since bought it back). He began to angel invest, writing early checks for Gong and Carbon Health. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">People in Altschuler’s considerable network kept asking him to show them how to angel invest. So he decided to try doing that.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He emailed a list of GTM people and shared an idea: “What if we raised a million dollars between 20 to 50 of us and put it into 10 companies and then meaningfully supported those companies?” he suggested. “And it went gangbusters. We ended up raising $22 million for Fund I.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LPs in the fund can opt to do as much or as little as they want to assist, from silent investing to being highly involved with portfolio companies. GTMfund has also built out community functions: like a deal flow channel where LPs can chat; and it hosts six dinners a year as well as an annual retreat.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s become, for me, just a labor of love. It’s a lot of fun,” he said. “I’m getting the same out of it as our LPs are. I love working with all these different founders, all these different companies to help them on this kind of niche topic of GTM.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GTMfund’s structure as an operator fund isn’t common, but it also isn’t unheard-of. For instance, Mallun Yen founded Operator Collective in 2019, which launched out of the gate with $45 million, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/20/operator-collective-was-early-to-bring-on-operators-as-lps-now-its-doubling-down/\">raised a second $92 million in 2022</a> and also has an enviable portfolio. Another more recent example is Ashley Mayer’s Coalition which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/28/coalition-wants-to-make-more-women-operators-and-investors-at-the-same-damn-time/\">launched in 2022 with $12.5 million</a>. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for GTMfund’s second fund, Altschuler says the goal is to back about 40 early-stage companies at pre-seed, seed, and the occasional Series A — with check sizes of between half a million and $1.5 million.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">DSTLRY, a <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/games/dstlry-raises-5m-for-digital-comics-publishing-and-marketplace/\" rel=\"nofollow\">venture-backed</a> digital comic books marketplace, on Tuesday added a pair of features designed to bring customization to the platform. The first feature, dubbed Commissioned Digital Remarques, allows creators to add personalized sketches and signatures to digital comics. The second, Unlimited Digital Covers, expands platform-wide access to alternative comic book covers.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Commissioned Digital Remarques brings the tradition of in-person comic customization into the digital realm. At conventions, waiting in line for an artist’s sketch or signature is a major part of the fan experience. In the comics world, a remarque is a small sketch or doodle made on a book’s cover or pages, often integrating with existing artwork. The sketches are less time-intensive than full character illustrations but still highly valued by collectors.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In DSTLRY’s take on things, it’s the creators who set both the price and turnaround time. Like the books themselves, once a digital comic is remarqued, users can then turn around and sell or trade the remarqued issues on DSTLRY.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When former Comixology executives, David Steinberger and Chip Mosher, first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/13/comixology-vets-return-with-their-own-publishing-company/\">announced the company in 2023</a>, collectability was a tentpole feature. Forced scarcity in the form of limited editions has been deeply engrained in comics for decades now. While Steinberger and Mosher were quick to note that DSTLRY would never be an NFT marketplace, limited editions still play a major role in its built-in comics marketplace — and business model.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Variant covers – when a publisher releases multiple covers for a single issue — have played a key role in comic book collectability for decades. The phenomenon took off during the 1990s comics speculator boom, when things like holograms and holofoil were all the rage. While the bottom has fallen out of the market in the intervening decades, collectors still play a major role in the ecosystem.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new Unlimited Digital Covers feature means that both the main and alternative covers remain in digital circulation for the life of the book. Some scarcity will remain, however. Along with remarques, “collectible variants” are available for a single week after the book’s release. After that, users have to buy or trade for them in the DSTLRY Marketplace.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, all products bought and sold through the site’s built-in secondary market continue to generate royalties for creators. That’s a key difference between the DSTLRY model and the traditional resale market, wherein artists and writers don’t get a cut when back issues are sold.</p>\n\n</div>",

With Invites, users can create and share invitations on their iPhone, RSVP, contribute to Shared Albums, and curate event soundtracks.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To create an invitation, you need an iCloud+ subscription. However, anyone can RSVP, regardless of whether they have an Apple Account or Apple device.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When creating an invitation, users can select a photo from their library or pick one from the app’s gallery. The app integrates with Maps and Weather to give guests directions to the event and to notify them about the forecast for that day.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Participants can contribute photos and videos to a dedicated Shared Album within each invite as a way to save their memories and relive the event at a later time. A collaborative playlist feature lets Apple Music subscribers create a soundtrack for the event that guests can access right from the invite.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, users can create unique event invitations using Apple’s Image Playground to produce original images for invites. Plus, users can leverage Apple Intelligence’s Writing Tools to compose invitations. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hosts can view and manage their events, share invitations with a link, and review RSVPs. They have to option to select which details to show in an invite preview, such as the event background or a home address.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the other hand, guests can view and respond to an invitation through the app or on the web. Attendees can control how their information shows up to others, and they have the option to leave or report events.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With Apple Invites, an event comes to life from the moment the invitation is created, and users can share lasting memories even after they get together,” said Brent Chiu-Watson, Apple’s senior director of Worldwide Product Marketing for Apps and iCloud in <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/introducing-apple-invites-a-new-app-that-brings-people-together/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">a press release</a>. “Apple Invites brings together capabilities our users already know and love across iPhone, iCloud, and Apple Music, making it easy to plan special events.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple Invites is available for free on the App Store for all iPhone models running iOS 18 or later and can be accessed on the web at <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/invites/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">icloud.com/invites</a>.</p>\n</div>",

There’s no shortage of apps that can insert someone into a photo, or make a person appear to say something they didn’t actually say. But most deepfakes — and video deepfakes in particular — fail to clear the uncanny valley. There’s usually some tell or obvious sign that AI was involved somewhere. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Not so with OmniHuman-1 — at least from the cherry-picked samples the ByteDance team released.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s a fictional Taylor Swift performance:</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"global-consent eu-consent tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" data-iframe-height=\"375\" data-iframe-sandbox=\"\" data-iframe-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CVVNK06LVac?feature=oembed\" data-iframe-width=\"500\"></div>\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s a TED Talk that never took place:</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"global-consent eu-consent tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" data-iframe-height=\"281\" data-iframe-sandbox=\"\" data-iframe-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V_ZjvRmHZOI?feature=oembed\" data-iframe-width=\"500\"></div>\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And here’s a deepfaked Einstein lecture: </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"global-consent eu-consent tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" data-iframe-height=\"375\" data-iframe-sandbox=\"\" data-iframe-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n6HKcS2pj0Q?feature=oembed\" data-iframe-width=\"500\"></div>\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the ByteDance researchers, OmniHuman-1 only needs a single reference image and audio, like speech or vocals, to generate a video. The output video’s aspect ratio is adjustable, as is the subject’s “body proportion” — i.e. how much of their body is shown in the fake clip.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OmniHuman-1 can also edit existing videos, even modifying the movements of a person’s limbs. It’s truly astonishing how convincing the result can be: </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"global-consent eu-consent tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" data-iframe-height=\"375\" data-iframe-sandbox=\"\" data-iframe-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4-PKhdg_YS4?feature=oembed\" data-iframe-width=\"500\"></div>\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Granted, OmniHuman-1 isn’t perfect. The ByteDance team says that “low-quality” reference images won’t yield the best videos, and the system seems to struggle with certain poses. Note the weird gestures with the wine glass in this video: </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"global-consent eu-consent tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" data-iframe-height=\"375\" data-iframe-sandbox=\"\" data-iframe-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z8pXnnOgC9w?feature=oembed\" data-iframe-width=\"500\"></div>\n</div></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, OmniHuman-1 is easily heads and shoulders above previous deepfake techniques, and it may well be a sign of things to come. While ByteDance hasn’t released the system, the AI community tends not to take long to reverse-engineer models like these.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The implications are worrisome. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, political deepfakes spread like wildfire around the globe. On election day in Taiwan, a Chinese Communist Party-affiliated group <a href=\"https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/final/en-us/microsoft-brand/documents/MTAC-East-Asia-Report.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">posted AI-generated, misleading audio of a politician throwing</a> his support behind a pro-China candidate. In Moldova, deepfake videos depicted the country’s president, Maia Sandu, resigning. And in South Africa, <a href=\"https://africacheck.org/fact-checks/meta-programme-fact-checks/will-real-slim-shady-please-stand-eminem-video-endorsing\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">a deepfake</a> of rapper Eminem supporting a South African opposition party circulated ahead of the country’s election.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deepfakes are also increasingly being used to carry out financial crimes. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriswestfall/2024/11/29/ai-deepfakes-of-elon-musk-on-the-rise-causing-billions-in-fraud-losses/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Consumers are being duped by deepfakes of celebrities</a> offering fraudulent investment opportunities, while <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">corporations are being swindled out of millions</a> by deepfake impersonators. According to <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/financial-services-industry-predictions/2024/deepfake-banking-fraud-risk-on-the-rise.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Deloitte</a>, AI-generated content contributed to more than $12 billion in fraud losses in 2023, and could reach $40 billion in the U.S. by 2027. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last February, hundreds in the AI community <a href=\"https://openletter.net/l/disrupting-deepfakes\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">signed an open letter calling for strict deepfake </a><a href=\"https://openletter.net/l/disrupting-deepfakes\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">regulation</a>. In the absence of a law criminalizing deepfakes at the federal level in the U.S., more than 10 states have enacted statutes against AI-aided impersonation. California’s law — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/02/judge-blocks-californias-new-ai-law-in-case-over-kamala-harris-deepfake-musk-reposted/\">currently stalled</a> — would be the first to empower judges to order the posters of deepfakes to take them down or potentially face monetary penalties.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unfortunately, deepfakes are hard to detect. While <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/05/meta-deepfake-labels/\">some social networks</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/google-adds-new-disclosures-for-ai-photos-but-its-still-not-obvious-at-first-glance/\">search engines</a> have taken steps to limit their spread, the volume of deepfake content online continues to grow at an alarmingly fast rate. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.jumio.com/about/press-releases/global-identity-survey-2024/\" rel=\"nofollow\">In a May 2024 survey</a> from ID verification firm Jumio, 60% of people said they encountered a deepfake in the past year. Seventy-two percent of respondents to the poll said they were worried about being fooled by deepfakes on a daily basis, while a majority supported legislation to address the proliferation of AI-generated fakes.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Swiss startup <a href=\"https://logicstar.ai\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">LogicStar</a> is bent on joining the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/15/what-exactly-is-an-ai-agent/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AI agent</a> game. The summer 2024-founded startup has bagged $3 million in pre-seed funding to bring tools to the developer market that can do autonomous maintenance of software applications, rather than the more typical AI agent use-case of code co-development.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LogicStar CEO and co-founder Boris Paskalev suggests the startup’s AI agents could end up partnering with code development agents — such as, say, the likes of Cognition Labs’ Devin — in a business win-win.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Code fidelity is an issue for AI agents building and deploying software, just as it is for human developers, and LogicStar wants to do its bit to grease the development wheel by automatically picking up and fixing bugs wherever they may crop up in deployed code. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As it stands, Paskalev suggests that “even the best models and agents” out there are unable to resolve the majority of bugs they’re presented with — hence the team spying an opportunity for an AI startup that’s dedicated to improving these odds and delivering on the dream of less tedious app maintenance.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To this end, they are building atop large language models (LLMs) — such as OpenAI’s GPT or even China’s DeepSeek — taking a model-agnostic approach for their platform. This allows LogicStar to dip into different LLMs and maximize its AI agents’ utility, based on which foundational model works best for resolving a particular code issue.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Paskalev contends that the founding team has the technical and domain-specific knowledge to build a platform that can resolve programming problems which can challenge or outfox LLMs working alone. They also have past entrepreneurial success to point to: he sold his prior code review startup, DeepCode, to cybersecurity giant Snyk back in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/snyk-acquires-deepcode-to-boost-its-code-review-smarts/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">September 2020</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the beginning we were thinking about actually building a large language model for code,” he told TechCrunch. “Then we realized that that will quickly become a commodity… Now we’re building assuming all those large language models are there. Assuming there’s some actually decent [AI] agents for code, how do we extract the maximum business value from them?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He said that the idea built on the team’s understanding of how to analyze software applications. “Combine that with large language models — then focus into grounding and verifying what those large language models and the AI agent actually suggest.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-test-driven-development\">Test-driven development</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What does that mean in practice? Paskalev says LogicStar performs an analysis of each application that its tech is deployed on — using “classical computer science methods” — in order to build a “knowledge base”. This gives its AI agent a comprehensive map of the software’s inputs and outputs; how variables link to functions; and any other linkages and dependencies etc. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, for every bug it’s presented with, the AI agent is able to determine which parts of the application are impacted — allowing LogicStar to narrow down the functions needing to be simulated in order to test scores of potential fixes. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Per Paskalev, this “minimized execution environment” allows the AI agent to run “thousands” of tests aimed at reproducing bugs to identify a “failing test”, and — through this “test-driven development” approach — ultimately land on a fix that sticks.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He confirms that the actual bug fixes are sourced from the LLMs. But because LogicStar’s platform enables this “very fast executive environment” its AI agents can work at scale to separate the wheat from the chaff, as it were, and serve its users with a shortcut to the best that LLMs can offer.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What we see is [LLMs are] great for prototyping, testing things, etc, but it’s absolutely not great for [code] production, commercial applications. I think we’re far from there, and this is what our platform delivers,” he argued. “To be able to extract those capabilities of the models today, we can actually safely extract commercial value and actually save time for developers to really focus on the important stuff.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enterprises are set to be LogicStar’s initial target. Its “silicon agents” are intended to be put to work alongside corporate dev teams, albeit at a fraction of the salary required to hire a human developer, handling a range of app upkeep tasks and freeing up engineering talent for more creative and/or challenging work. (Or, well, at least until LLMs and AI agents get a lot more capable.)</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the startup’s pitch touts a “fully autonomous” app maintenance capability, Paskalev confirms that the platform will allow human developers to review (and otherwise oversee) the fixes its AI agents call up. So trust can be — and must be — earned first. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The accuracy that a human developer delivers ranges between 80 to 90%. Our goal [for our AI agents] is to be exactly there,” he adds.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s still early days for LogicStar: an alpha version of its technology is in testing with a number of undisclosed companies which Paskalev refers to as “design partners”. Currently the tech only supports Python — but expansions to Typescript, Javascript and Java are billed as “coming soon”. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The main goal [with the pre-seed funding] is to actually show the technology works with our design partners — focusing on Python,” adds Paskalev. “We already spent a year on it, and we have lots of opportunity to actually expand. And that’s why we’re trying to focus it first, to show the value in one case.”</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup’s pre-seed raise was led by European VC firm Northzone, with angel investors from DeepMind, Fleet, Sequoia scouts, Snyk and Spotify also joining the round. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a statement, Michiel Kotting, partner at Northzone, said: “AI-driven code generation is still in its early stages, but the productivity gains we’re already seeing are revolutionary. The potential for this technology to streamline development processes, reduce costs, and accelerate innovation is immense. and the team’s vast technical expertise and proven track record position them to deliver real, impactful results. The future of software development is being reshaped, and LogicStar will play a crucial role in software maintenance.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LogicStar is operating a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKE5SROAvar8h5BIHAAATYYd2G3I2dpJyxaJPFdsYkbu4mrw/viewform\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">waiting list</a> for potential customers wanting to express interest in getting early access. It told us a beta release is planned for later this year.  </p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Two space startups have merged to create the next generation of telescopes",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">On a clear spring evening in Michigan, the stars aligned — just not in the way Upfront Ventures partner Nick Kim expected.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He’d just led <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/06/oursky-lands-9-5m-seed-to-build-out-developer-platform-for-space-data/\">a $9.5 million seed round</a> for OurSky, a software platform for space observational data, and was eager to see what its telescope partner PlaneWave Instruments could do. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But when they rolled out the telescopes that night at PlaneWave’s manufacturing facility, he was stuck waiting. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It took them quite a long time to get the first image. I’m talking like, multiple hours. And these are the people who make the telescopes! They were using all this, like, off-the-shelf, open-source software that they kind of cobbled together,”  Kim said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kim wasn’t upset, though. He was excited. “This is why OurSky needed to exist, right? This is the problem,” he remembered thinking. “What a perfect match.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was such a good match that, now, OurSky and PlaneWave are merging to create a new company called Observable Space. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OurSky founder Dan Roelker and PlaneWave founder Richard Hedrick say this will make the telescopes easier to use. And they also believe the tighter integration will open up new markets – especially as they leverage their position as the only U.S.-based telescope manufacturer. They already count NASA, the U.S. Space Force, and Georgia State’s Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy as customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My dream was to integrate all the components on the telescope, even the parts we don’t sell, and then integrate the control of the telescope,” Hedrick said in an interview. “It was very obvious for us to be working together.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Roelker, who was SpaceX’s VP of software engineering from 2015 to 2019, said telescope users have to deal with what he called a “mash of integration bullsh–.” PlaneWave’s vertical strategy combined with OurSky’s software will eliminate those headaches, he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Solving that integration problem is an opportunity for Observable Space to grow the market, Roelker said. (The platform OurSky has built will continue on in that name, and the telescopes will continue to be sold under the PlaneWave brand.)</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That can involve a number of things, like letting users tap multiple telescopes at a single site — or even around the world — to mimic the capabilities of a much larger telescope, or sending communications to and from space via laser, all while lowering cost.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Squeezing more out of his high-quality telescopes sold Hedrick on the merger. It will make the tech more approachable and affordable for enthusiasts and institutions alike.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hedrick said one of those institutions recently designed some one-meter telescopes and had them custom built by someone else. “And they were like, ‘God, if you had existed, we never would have done that,’” he said.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-new-business\">New business</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the cost to get to orbit shrinks, more companies are sending things to space, Roelker said. That means there is increased demand for the ability to locate and track objects orbiting the Earth, communicate with spacecraft, and enable defense and intelligence applications. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Observable Space can be a key player in that new economy, according to Mislav Tolusic, managing partner at dual-use venture fund Marlinspike, which has invested in Observable Space.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Every day you’re relying on space,” Tolusic said in an interview. “If you take out GPS constellations, we’re in trouble economically. It’s a big, big, big deal. A lot of systems stop functioning. And guess what? The future is going to be even more dependent on that infrastructure.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tolusic praised PlaneWave’s quality, and noted Hedrick built up the company at a time when basically all telescope manufacturing is overseas – which he believes is an advantage. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you want to replicate that [in the U.S.], you have to go figure out how to make those fine lenses, how to make gimbals – and not just how to design them but how to spit them out by the thousands,” he said.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jordan Noone, general partner at Embedded Ventures, explained his fund’s investment with a specific example of what OurSky and PlaneWave can do as a combined company. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shortly before the merger, Noone was at Mount Wilson Observatory in Los Angeles for a demo of the companies’ products working together. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He told TechCrunch that the teams pulled an observation request from the queue on OurSky’s platform: a satellite operator had lost radio contact with its spacecraft. The OurSky and PlaneWave teams located it quickly. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What he described was a much smoother experience than Kim’s demo in Michigan, and served as proof in his mind that Observable Space was a good bet to make. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Many of the world’s most valuable companies, like Apple, Nvidia – they’re hardware/software platform combos,” Noone said. “Companies that approach just one of those two can have a lot of inherent value, but the combination of both in today’s world is extremely powerful.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-star-wars-or-star-trek\">Star Wars or Star Trek?</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Observable Space has about 100 employees, with the manufacturing operations remaining in Michigan, some engineering happening in Los Angeles, California, and an observatory outside Washington, D.C. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s already revenue-generating, and the combined company has raised $11 million to date, including funding from In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s non-profit strategic investment arm.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hedrick and Roelker said the two companies have fit together easily, since they were both focused on such different businesses and didn’t have massive back office operations.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Going through the merger process itself was actually really valuable, because when you’re going through it, a lot of issues pop up,” Roelker said. “You actually get a really good sense of how you’re going to work together. And I think both Rick and I felt really good about that, because we actually went through some really hard things during the merger.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked, the pair did not describe those “hard things,” and Hedrick instead quipped: “We had to decide on whether [the company] was going to be Star Wars or Star Trek.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The answer?</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Battlestar Galactica,” Roelker said.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Sotira lands $2M to help brands offload and monetize their surplus inventory",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">An estimated <a href=\"https://www.netsuite.com/portal/resource/articles/inventory-management/obsolete-inventory.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">20% to 30% of all inventory</a> in the U.S. is surplus, with much of it ending up in landfills. A startup called <a href=\"https://www.sotira.co/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Sotira</a> wants to help address this problem: It leverages AI to help companies offload and monetize their surplus inventory. Sotira partners with brands to offload millions of pounds of surplus grocery, health and wellness, and cosmetics goods all over the United States. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To fuel its mission, the company has closed a $2 million pre-seed funding round. Sotira plans to use the new funding to expand its operations nationally, specifically the midwest and southeast.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup, which exhibited at TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield 200 2024, was founded by CEO Amrita Bhasin and CTO Gary Kwong. The pair met at UC Berkeley and bonded over their shared interest in the ecommerce and logistics space. Bhasin and Kwong were both running their own companies that were focused on selling previously owned, new, or used products. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The duo then started running a liquidation business together because they wanted to understand how the space operated before jumping into starting a company. They decided to cast a wide net before zeroing in on their mission with Sotira. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We learned that the market opportunity for monetizing overstock is huge,” Bhasin told TechCrunch. “It is a multi-billion-dollar market, and it is a very old-school manual space, like the people we’re talking to are doing things on pen and paper. They’ve never heard of ChatGPT, they don’t know what AI is. And so that pretty much was the catalyst for us starting the company. We were like, there is a market opportunity here.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sotira helps to offload products that are nearing their expiration date, items that are facing storage capacity issues, and products that have been over-ordered. Vetted suppliers can sign up for Sotira and link their storage capacity or inventory. Sotira then matches the products to a buyer that will then pick up pallets from the supplier’s warehouse. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Buyers are verified, brick-and-mortar stores all over the country. They can share the UPC codes of the kind of inventory they purchase, and Sotira will use AI to match them with inventory. Sotira automates compliance and facilitates transactions and logistics with buyers so suppliers get paid out upon pickups. Sotira’s goal is to clear surplus within a few days of receiving inventory data. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the past, brands would have had to identify the stock they would not be able to sell to their primary purchasers, and then call up different liquidators to compare offers and manually negotiate prices. Sotira has brought this process online and allows suppliers to clear up inventory much faster.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sotira charges a monthly fee for access; it also takes a percentage of revenue from each transaction on its platform. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Sotira is beneficial for suppliers and buyers, Bahsin says Sotira is also proud of its ability to open up affordable access to premium products that people may otherwise be unable to access. For instance, Sotira works with a lot of CPG beverage brands that end up offloading their excess inventory to discount grocery stores. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the economy right now, where you currently look at how rapidly grocery prices are increasing, these are the categories consumers purchase the most,” Bahsin said. “There is so much value in opening affordable access to these items. A lot of the buyers we work with are in rural areas. They’re in areas that they may be more impoverished, where consumers actually rely on purchasing from over-stock stores, like they won’t purchase from a Whole Foods, they’re purchasing from a discount grocery store.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bahsin also noted that since <a href=\"https://www.cbs8.com/article/news/local/new-california-law-requires-large-venues-donate-leftover-food-instead-of-throwing-it-away/509-e06c8377-3ff4-4965-925b-5fb319b28fed\" rel=\"nofollow\">California has passed legislation</a> to stop grocery stores from dumping food and beverages, Sotira can now approach these companies and inform them that there’s a market for their surplus inventory. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sotira plans to expand beyond food, beverage, health, and cosmetics in the future and move into the apparel space. The company is getting interest from brands that want help moving their excess clothing and shoes, Bhasin said. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sotira’s pre-seed funding included participation from Unusual Ventures, Night Capital, K5 Global, Ritual Capital, and others. </p>\n</div>",
