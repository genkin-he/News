I would say that the overall environment of uncertainty is benefiting our business,” he said on the call.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Among the appealing features that attract users to Snapchat is Spotlight, which serves as the company’s alternative to TikTok. Many creators are already on the platform, and more will likely join if TikTok goes offline in the U.S. again. Over the past year, Snap has onboarded thousands of creators into its Snap Star program, and the number of creators posting content grew by more than 40% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, says the company.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spiegel also highlighted the growth of Snapchat’s public content. He added, “I think in Q4 we actually reached a billion public posts a month on Snapchat. So the public content ecosystem is growing in a really nice and healthy way, and so we’re just going to continue our focus there when it comes to our strategy and participation.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the fourth quarter, the company reported that it reached 453 million daily active users, an increase of 39 million from the previous period. Snap reported a revenue of $1.55 billion, up from $1.36 billion the previous year.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The uncertainty surrounding TikTok has not only benefited Snap but has also affected the broader social media landscape, with several apps, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/xiaohongshu-rednote-chinas-answer-to-instagram-hits-no-1-on-the-app-store-as-tiktok-faces-us-shutdown/\">including the Chinese-owned RedNote</a>, YouTube, and Meta seeing boosts in user engagement. </p>\n</div>",

But AMD has gained ground in the last year, acquiring and retaining customers including Meta, Microsoft, and IBM.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AMD says that sales of AMD Instinct chips reached over $5 billion in 2024, and the company expects its data center segment to grow “double digits” in 2025. Last year, data center revenue made up around half ($3.9 billion) of AMD’s overall revenue ($7.1 billion), the company reported.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I believe that the demand for AI compute is strong,” Su continued. “We see [the data center] business growing to tens of billions as we go through the next couple of years.”</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">As a university student, Dalton Signor was troubled by how many people around him smoked or vaped, including his grandmother and 14-year-old sister.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Signor (pictured center) felt that existing smoking cessation medicines, whether patches, gums, or lozenges, are not very effective because they take too long to start working. “They take about 30 minutes to provide relief, but the average person relapses in 11 minutes,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, three years ago, he set out to develop a withdrawal-inhibitor inhaler because delivering medication directly to the lungs allows for rapid absorption into the bloodstream, providing faster relief. He dropped out of the university to work on this problem, creating Miist Therapeutics, attracting Jeff Schuster (pictured left), a physicist who has<a href=\"https://patents.justia.com/inventor/jeffrey-a-schuster?page=3\" rel=\"nofollow\"> dozens of patents</a> for developing inhaled medicines, as CTO and co-founder, and his long-term friend and biomedical engineer Eric Ezerins (pictured right) as head of R&amp;D.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Three years after launching, Miist announced it secured $7 million in seed funding from investors including Refactor Capital, 1517 Fund, and Freeflow Ventures.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Refractor’s solo GP Zal Bilmoria said he initially wasn’t convinced that Miist’s approach would be effective. But when Signor presented him with the results of the company’s Phase I trial, the former Andreessen Horowitz partner who helped launch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/18/zal-bilimoria-refactor-capital-venture-capital/\">that firm’s first Bio Fund</a>, instantly changed his mind.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The small study showed that smokers who used Miist’s inhaler eliminated 92% of their cravings in only two minutes, a 10X improvement over the existing standard of care. “It’s game-changing,” Bilmoria said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Signor explained that Miist’s technology produces particles that are 50% smaller than other inhalers, which means the medicine is deposited deeper in the lungs, where the lining is just one cell thick, leading to faster absorption into the bloodstream.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Miist calls its invention an inhaler, it looks and acts like a vaping device. Signor said that its vape-like properties may help with the psychological aspects of quitting.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When people quit, they miss taking the five-minute smoke break and like having that part of their day to themselves,” he said, adding that even though the medicine could be delivered in one inhalation, Miist chose to spread it out over seven puffs to mimic the behaviour of smoking.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2959994\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1280\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4326.jpg?resize=708,472 708w\" style=\"width:934px;height:auto\" width=\"1920\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Miist</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nicotine addiction is not the only health issue where rapid release makes a big difference.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company recently launched a program for migraines. For someone in the throes of a migraine the difference between fast-acting and slow-absorbing medication can be significant. It not only provides faster relief, but can also help avert a much longer, untreatable attack.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although several nasal inhaler formulations of migraine drugs currently exist, Miist anticipates that its oral inhaler will be more effective.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Miist is gearing up to run a Phase II trial of its smoking cessation tech that uses the active ingredient in standard nicotine replacement therapy, like Nicorette. It is also currently testing triptans, a class of migraine drugs, in the lab, Signor said. Signor envisions that the inhaler can one day also be used to administer other medicines for other conditions, such as anxiety control.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Miist is not the only startup developing a vape-like device for smoking cessation and migraines. Qnovia has raised over $35 million at an estimated $350 million valuation from investors including Blue Ledge Capital, DG Ventures, and Vice Venture,<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2024/10/25/qnovia-respirx-nicotine-replacement-therapy-nrt-new-device-to-quit-smoking/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Forbes reported</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Qnovia, like Miist, needs FDA clearance before selling its device in the US. If approved, they will be the first prescription-approved smoking cessation treatment to come to market in <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5347897/#:~:text=On%2011%20May%202006%2C%20the,had%20experienced%20suicidal%20behaviour%202.\" rel=\"nofollow\">nearly two decades</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some may view vaping as an unorthodox method of drug delivery. However, Refractor’s Bilmoria believes that its effectiveness should override people’s reservations.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s unbelievable to me that the pharma industry has overlooked this opportunity,” he said.</p>\n</div>",

The change was first spotted by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-04/google-removes-language-on-weapons-from-public-ai-principles\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bloomberg</a>. The company appears to have updated its public AI principles page, erasing a section titled “applications we will not pursue,” which was <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250130075626/https://ai.google/responsibility/principles/\" rel=\"nofollow\">still included</a> as recently as last week.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asked for comment, the company pointed TechCrunch to <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/ai/responsible-ai-2024-report-ongoing-work/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a new blog post</a> on “responsible AI.” It notes, in part, “we believe that companies, governments, and organizations sharing these values should work together to create AI that protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security.”</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s <a href=\"https://ai.google/responsibility/principles/\" rel=\"nofollow\">newly updated AI principles</a> note the company will work to “mitigate unintended or harmful outcomes and avoid unfair bias,” as well as align the company with “widely accepted principles of international law and human rights.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In recent years, Google’s contracts to provide the U.S. and Israeli militaries with cloud services have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/18/google-fires-28-employees-after-sit-in-protest-over-controversial-project-nimbus-contract-with-israe/\">sparked internal protests from employees</a>.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Cybersecurity company SailPoint is hoping to go public — again. This time, the company plans to sell $1 billion worth of stock and hit an $11.5 billion valuation in its planned IPO.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s how the math works out for a proposed offering it <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250204490452/en/SailPoint-Announces-Launch-of-Initial-Public-Offering\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> Tuesday of 47.5 million shares, at between $19 to $21.  SailPoint’s owner, Thoma Bravo, plans to also sell 2.5 million shares.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SailPoint offers identity management wares to enterprises and is a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/okta-lays-off-180-employees-nearly-one-year-after-last-workforce-reduction/\">competitor to $16 billion market-cap Okta</a>. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t Sailpoint’s first time as a public company. It was publicly traded until Thoma Bravo took SailPoint private in 2022, valuing it at $6.9 billion at the time. The private equity giant will still own over 87% of the company after the IPO.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2030781/000119312525019604/d885522ds1a.htm#rom885522_7\" rel=\"nofollow\">said in its S-1 filing</a> that it’s on track for $813 annual recurring revenue, as of October. SailPoint reported annual net losses of just over $395 million on about $700 million in revenues as of January 2024; the company said it has more than $1 billion in debt, with its balance sheet showing debt of $1.5 billion. SailPoint said it will use the proceeds to address its debt, as well as fund operations.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the financial sophistication of SailPoint’s owners, the stock may very price above that range, and easily bypass that hoped-for cash haul and valuation.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founder Mark McClain, who stayed on as CEO after Thoma Bravo acquired the company, still has a relatively tiny stake of just over 3.6 million shares. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Not many founding CEOs find themselves in a position to introduce their company to the public market for a second time, but I am grateful to be able to do precisely that,” he remarked in his <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2030781/000119312525019604/d885522ds1a.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">prospectus letter</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because SailPoint isn’t a startup, this IPO, which could happen next week, won’t be a boon for any venture capitalists. But the success of the offering will be closely watched by them. VCs and startups are still reading the tea leaves on the timing to bring <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/01/here-are-all-the-ipos-reported-to-be-in-the-works-for-2025/\">their many IPO-ready tech startups public</a>. Should retail investors gobble the stock, this will be another signal that 2025 could be a good year to not just open a window, but a door.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then again, even if investors are hungry for this IPO, other factors could slow other offerings. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stock-market-stocks-djia-dow-jones-sp500-trump-tariffs-impact/plan\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wall Street grew plenty nervous</a> over the Trump Administration’s plans to start a North America tariff trade war, although those plans have now been postponed for at least a month. Should policy events keep rattling the markets, tech startups may just continue to stay under cover. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Figure AI founder and CEO Brett Adcock <a href=\"https://x.com/adcock_brett/status/1886860098980733197\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced Tuesday</a> that the humanoid robotics firm is exiting a deal with OpenAI. The Bay Area-based robotics company has instead opted to focus on in-house AI, owing to a “major breakthrough.” Adcock was tightlipped in terms of specifics, but he promised to deliver “something no one has ever seen on a humanoid” in the next 30 days.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI has been a longtime investor in Figure. The pair <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/29/figure-rides-the-humanoid-robot-hype-wave-to-2-6b-valuation-and-openai-collab/\">announced a deal</a> last year that aimed to “develop next generation AI models for humanoid robots.” At the same time, Figure announced a $675 million raise, valuing the company at $2.6 billion. Figure has so far raised a total of $1.5 billion.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news is a surprise, in part, given the cultural zeitgeist OpenAI has built by mainstreaming generative AI. Mere association with the company comes with a rapid profile boost. In August, the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/06/figures-new-humanoid-robot-leverages-openai-for-natural-speech-conversations/\">two companies announced</a> that the Figure 02 humanoid would use OpenAI models for natural language communication.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The issue with the collaboration, according to Adcock, is integration. OpenAI is a huge company with a massive breadth — and the intelligence models to match. Embodied AI, which brings artificial intelligence to physical objects such as robots, isn’t the ChatGPT maker’s primary focus. Instead, the executive suggests, the proper solution is building an end-to-end AI model focused on powering specific hardware.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We found that to solve embodied AI at scale in the real world, you have to vertically integrate robot AI,” Adcock tells TechCrunch. “We can’t outsource AI for the same reason we can’t outsource our hardware.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI has notably hedged its bets in the humanoid space. The firm was also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/27/openai-backed-1x-acquires-kind-humanoid/\">a major backer of 1X</a>. While the majority of humanoid firms are focused on warehouses and factories, the Norwegian startup has shifted much of its own focus on the home. On a trip to Figure’s Sunnyvale office <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/12/face-to-face-with-figures-new-humanoid-robot/\">last September</a>, Adcock told TechCrunch that the company is also exploring the use of its systems in a home setting.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That, however, is not the priority for Figure. After all, automakers have deeper pockets than individuals when it comes to exploring new technology. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/18/bmw-will-deploy-figures-humanoid-robot-at-south-carolina-plant/\">BMW announced</a> last year that it had begun deploying Figure robots at a South Carolina factory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI may also be exploring its own humanoid hardware. On Friday, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/openais-new-trademark-application-hints-at-humanoid-robots-smart-jewelry-and-more/\">the company filed</a> a trademark application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) involving humanoids. The text references both “user-programmable humanoid robots” and “humanoid robots having communication and learning functions for assisting and entertaining people.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While intriguing, however, IP filings are not a guarantee of future products. Even so, it’s difficult to ignore these two pieces of news arriving in under a week. Figure’s massive funding rounds, meanwhile, have allowed it to quickly expand both its hardware and software teams. The company recently moved into a larger Bay Area office to accommodate  its rapidly growing staff.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When it comes to proprietary software, there’s a lot to be said for the Apple ecosystem approach to product development. It’s an effective way to create software that works especially well with your hardware systems. It is, however, both difficult and very resource intensive.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most humanoid firms are working on their own bespoke AI models to differing degrees. Partnerships are still prevalent in the industry, however. In October, Boston Dynamics <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/boston-dynamics-teams-with-tri-to-bring-ai-smarts-to-atlas-humanoid-robot/\">announced</a> that it has been working with Toyota Research Institute (TRI) to bring artificial smarts to the Atlas humanoid robot.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI for comment.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Hugging Face researchers aim to build an ‘open’ version of OpenAI’s deep research tool",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">A group of developers at AI dev platform Hugging Face, including Thomas Wolf, the company’s co-founder and chief scientist, say they’ve built an “open” version of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/02/openai-unveils-a-new-chatgpt-agent-for-deep-research/\">OpenAI’s deep research tool</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deep research, which OpenAI unveiled during an event Sunday, crawls the web to compile research reports on any subject. While impressive, deep research is currently only available in limited preview to users subscribed to OpenAI’s $200-a-month ChatGPT Pro plan. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Hugging Face team’s project, which they’re calling Open Deep Research, consists of an AI model — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/05/openais-o1-model-sure-tries-to-deceive-humans-a-lot/\">OpenAI’s o1</a> — and an open source “agentic framework” that helps the model plan its analysis and guides it to use tools like search engines. O1 is a proprietary model (i.e. gated behind a paid API), but the team says it delivered better performance than “open” models such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/27/deepseek-claims-its-reasoning-model-beats-openais-o1-on-certain-benchmarks/\">DeepSeek’s R1</a>. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In less than 24 hours, the researchers were able to harness o1 to use a simple, text-based browser and a “text inspector” toolkit to read files across the web. Open Deep Research can navigate the web autonomously, the team says, scrolling through pages, manipulating files, and even running calculations with data. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On GAIA, a benchmark for general AI assistants, Open Deep Research achieves a score of 54%. That’s compared with OpenAI deep research’s score of 67.36%. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I tried Open Deep Research in <a href=\"https://m-ric-open-deep-research.hf.space/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the public demo</a> the team set up — but couldn’t get it to work. The page was under heavy load at publication time; after 10 minutes, it spit out an error message.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the researchers say that they’re committed to improving the experience, and have made the <a href=\"https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/tree/gaia-submission-r1/examples/open_deep_research\" rel=\"nofollow\">source code available on GitHub</a> for inspection and feedback. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Worth noting is that there are <a href=\"https://x.com/nickscamara_/status/1886459999905521912\" rel=\"nofollow\">a number of</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/dzhng/status/1886603396578484630\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenAI deep research “reproductions”</a> on the web, some of which rely on open models and tooling. The crucial component they — and Open Deep Research — lack is o3, the model underpinning deep research. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Few, if any, models beat <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/openai-launches-o3-mini-its-latest-reasoning-model/\">o3</a> on benchmarks related to answering complex questions and information gathering. Short of an open model to rival o3, deep research alternatives may not quite measure up to the real thing.</p>\n</div>",
