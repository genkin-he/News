            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">An estimated <a href=\"https://www.netsuite.com/portal/resource/articles/inventory-management/obsolete-inventory.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">20% to 30% of all inventory</a> in the U.S. is surplus, with much of it ending up in landfills. A startup called <a href=\"https://www.sotira.co/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Sotira</a> wants to help address this problem: It leverages AI to help companies offload and monetize their surplus inventory. Sotira partners with brands to offload millions of pounds of surplus grocery, health and wellness, and cosmetics goods all over the United States. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To fuel its mission, the company has closed a $2 million pre-seed funding round. Sotira plans to use the new funding to expand its operations nationally, specifically the midwest and southeast.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup, which exhibited at TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield 200 2024, was founded by CEO Amrita Bhasin and CTO Gary Kwong. The pair met at UC Berkeley and bonded over their shared interest in the ecommerce and logistics space. Bhasin and Kwong were both running their own companies that were focused on selling previously owned, new, or used products. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The duo then started running a liquidation business together because they wanted to understand how the space operated before jumping into starting a company. They decided to cast a wide net before zeroing in on their mission with Sotira. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We learned that the market opportunity for monetizing overstock is huge,” Bhasin told TechCrunch. “It is a multi-billion-dollar market, and it is a very old-school manual space, like the people we’re talking to are doing things on pen and paper. They’ve never heard of ChatGPT, they don’t know what AI is. And so that pretty much was the catalyst for us starting the company. We were like, there is a market opportunity here.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sotira helps to offload products that are nearing their expiration date, items that are facing storage capacity issues, and products that have been over-ordered. Vetted suppliers can sign up for Sotira and link their storage capacity or inventory. Sotira then matches the products to a buyer that will then pick up pallets from the supplier’s warehouse. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Buyers are verified, brick-and-mortar stores all over the country. They can share the UPC codes of the kind of inventory they purchase, and Sotira will use AI to match them with inventory. Sotira automates compliance and facilitates transactions and logistics with buyers so suppliers get paid out upon pickups. Sotira’s goal is to clear surplus within a few days of receiving inventory data. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the past, brands would have had to identify the stock they would not be able to sell to their primary purchasers, and then call up different liquidators to compare offers and manually negotiate prices. Sotira has brought this process online and allows suppliers to clear up inventory much faster.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sotira charges a monthly fee for access; it also takes a percentage of revenue from each transaction on its platform. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Sotira is beneficial for suppliers and buyers, Bahsin says Sotira is also proud of its ability to open up affordable access to premium products that people may otherwise be unable to access. For instance, Sotira works with a lot of CPG beverage brands that end up offloading their excess inventory to discount grocery stores. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the economy right now, where you currently look at how rapidly grocery prices are increasing, these are the categories consumers purchase the most,” Bahsin said. “There is so much value in opening affordable access to these items. A lot of the buyers we work with are in rural areas. They’re in areas that they may be more impoverished, where consumers actually rely on purchasing from over-stock stores, like they won’t purchase from a Whole Foods, they’re purchasing from a discount grocery store.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bahsin also noted that since <a href=\"https://www.cbs8.com/article/news/local/new-california-law-requires-large-venues-donate-leftover-food-instead-of-throwing-it-away/509-e06c8377-3ff4-4965-925b-5fb319b28fed\" rel=\"nofollow\">California has passed legislation</a> to stop grocery stores from dumping food and beverages, Sotira can now approach these companies and inform them that there’s a market for their surplus inventory. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sotira plans to expand beyond food, beverage, health, and cosmetics in the future and move into the apparel space. The company is getting interest from brands that want help moving their excess clothing and shoes, Bhasin said. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sotira’s pre-seed funding included participation from Unusual Ventures, Night Capital, K5 Global, Ritual Capital, and others. </p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">OpenAI gave me one week to test <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/23/openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-performs-tasks-autonomously/\">its new AI agent, Operator</a>, a system that can independently do tasks for you on the internet.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Operator is the closest thing I’ve seen to the tech industry’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/15/what-exactly-is-an-ai-agent/\">vision of AI agents</a> — systems that can automate the boring parts of life, freeing us up to do the things we really love. However, judging from my experience with OpenAI’s agent, truly “autonomous” AI systems are still just out of reach.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/computer-using-agent/\" rel=\"nofollow\">trained a new model to power Operator</a>, which combines the visual understanding of GPT-4o with the reasoning capabilities of o1.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That model seems to work well for basic tasks; I watched Operator click buttons, navigate menus on websites, and fill out forms. The AI was occasionally successful at independently taking actions, and it works much faster than web-based agents I’ve seen from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/anthropics-new-ai-can-control-your-pc/\">Anthropic</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/11/google-unveils-project-mariner-ai-agents-to-use-the-web-for-you/\">Google</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But during my trial, I found myself assisting OpenAI’s agent more than I’d like. It felt like I was coaching Operator through each problem, whereas I wanted to push certain tasks off my plate altogether.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Too often during my test, I had to answer several questions, grant permissions, fill out personal information, and help the agent when it got stuck.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In car terms, Operator is like driving a car with cruise control – occasionally taking your foot off the pedals and letting the car drive itself – but it’s far from full-blown autopilot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In fact, OpenAI says Operator’s frequent pauses are by design.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI powering Operator, much like the AI powering chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, can’t reliably work independently for long periods of time, and it’s prone to the same sort of hallucinating. Because of that, OpenAI doesn’t want to give the system too much decision-making power or sensitive user information. Maybe that’s a safe choice by OpenAI, but it reduces Operator’s practicality.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, OpenAI’s first agent is an impressive proof of concept — and interface — for an AI that can use the front end of any website. But to create truly independent AI systems, tech companies will need to build more reliable AI models that don’t require this much steering.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-little-too-hands-on\">A little too ‘hands on’</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">My Operator trial coincided with the week I was moving apartments, so I had OpenAI’s agent help with moving logistics.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I asked Operator to help me buy a new parking permit. OpenAI’s agent told me, “Sure,” then opened a window into its browser on my PC’s screen.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Operator then conducted a search for a San Francisco parking permit in the browser, took me to the correct city website, and even the right page.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Operator still lets you use the rest of your computer while it’s working, something that can’t be said for Google’s Project Mariner. This is because OpenAI’s agent isn’t really working on the computer, but rather, off in the cloud somewhere.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2958150\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"2086\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1608px) 100vw, 1608px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-24-at-9.57.44AM.png?w=524\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-24-at-9.57.44AM.png 1608w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-24-at-9.57.44AM.png?resize=116,150 116w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-24-at-9.57.44AM.png?resize=231,300 231w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-24-at-9.57.44AM.png?resize=768,996 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-24-at-9.57.44AM.png?resize=524,680 524w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-24-at-9.57.44AM.png?resize=925,1200 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-24-at-9.57.44AM.png?resize=987,1280 987w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-24-at-9.57.44AM.png?resize=331,430 331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-24-at-9.57.44AM.png?resize=555,720 555w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-24-at-9.57.44AM.png?resize=694,900 694w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-24-at-9.57.44AM.png?resize=617,800 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-24-at-9.57.44AM.png?resize=1184,1536 1184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-24-at-9.57.44AM.png?resize=1579,2048 1579w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-24-at-9.57.44AM.png?resize=515,668 515w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-24-at-9.57.44AM.png?resize=289,375 289w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-24-at-9.57.44AM.png?resize=476,617 476w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-24-at-9.57.44AM.png?resize=409,531 409w\" width=\"1608\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">The operator interface (Credit: Maxwell Zeff/OpenAI)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For my parking permit, I had to grant Operator permission to start different processes a few too many times. It also stopped to ask me to fill out forms with personal information – such as my name, phone number, and email address. At times, Operator also got lost, forcing me to take control of the browser and get the agent back on track.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In another test, I asked Operator to make me a reservation at a Greek restaurant. To its credit, Operator found me a nice place in my area with reasonable prices. But I had to answer more than half a dozen questions throughout the flow.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2958925\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"2022\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2114px) 100vw, 2114px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-restaurant-demo.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-restaurant-demo.jpg 2114w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-restaurant-demo.jpg?resize=150,143 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-restaurant-demo.jpg?resize=300,287 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-restaurant-demo.jpg?resize=768,735 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-restaurant-demo.jpg?resize=680,650 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-restaurant-demo.jpg?resize=1200,1148 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-restaurant-demo.jpg?resize=1280,1224 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-restaurant-demo.jpg?resize=430,411 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-restaurant-demo.jpg?resize=720,689 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-restaurant-demo.jpg?resize=900,861 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-restaurant-demo.jpg?resize=800,765 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-restaurant-demo.jpg?resize=1536,1469 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-restaurant-demo.jpg?resize=2048,1959 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-restaurant-demo.jpg?resize=668,639 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-restaurant-demo.jpg?resize=392,375 392w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-restaurant-demo.jpg?resize=645,617 645w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-restaurant-demo.jpg?resize=555,531 555w\" width=\"2114\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Some steps to making a reservation with Operator (Credit: Maxwell Zeff/OpenAI)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you have to intervene six or more times just to book a reservation through an AI agent, at what point is it easier to just do it yourself? That’s a question I asked myself a lot while testing Operator.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-agent-as-a-platform\">Agent-as-a-platform</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a few of my tests, I ran into websites that blocked Operator for whatever reason. For example, I tried booking an electrician using TaskRabbit, but OpenAI’s agent told me that it ran into an error, and asked if it could use an alternative service instead. Expedia, Reddit, and YouTube also blocked the AI agent from accessing their platforms.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, other services are embracing Operator with open arms. Instacart, Uber, and eBay collaborated with OpenAI for the launch of Operator, allowing the agent to navigate their websites on behalf of humans.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These businesses are preparing for a future where a subset of user interactions are facilitated by an AI agent.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Customers are using Instacart through a variety of different entry points,” said Daniel Danker, chief product officer at Instacart, in an interview with TechCrunch. “We see Operator as, potentially, another one of those entry points.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Letting OpenAI’s agent use Instacart’s website on behalf of a person seems like it would separate Instacart from its customers. However, Danker says Instacart wants to meet customers wherever they are.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We really are bullish about our belief, similar to OpenAI, that agentic systems will have a major impact on how consumers interact with digital properties,” said eBay’s chief AI officer, Nitzan Mekel-Bobrov, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even if AI agents rise in popularity, Mekel-Bobrov says he expects users will always come to eBay’s website, noting that “online destinations are not going anywhere.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-trust-issues\">Trust issues</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I had some issues trusting Operator after it hallucinated a few times, and nearly cost me several hundreds dollars.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, I asked the agent to find me a parking garage near my new apartment. It ended up suggesting two garages that it said would take just a few minutes to walk to.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2958924\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"792\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-demo.jpg?w=525\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-demo.jpg 612w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-demo.jpg?resize=116,150 116w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-demo.jpg?resize=232,300 232w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-demo.jpg?resize=525,680 525w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-demo.jpg?resize=332,430 332w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-demo.jpg?resize=556,720 556w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-demo.jpg?resize=516,668 516w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-demo.jpg?resize=290,375 290w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-demo.jpg?resize=477,617 477w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Operator-demo.jpg?resize=410,531 410w\" width=\"612\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Hallucination about parking spot distances (Credit: Maxwell Zeff/OpenAI)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Besides being way out of my price range, the garages were actually really far from my apartment. One was a 20-minute walk away, and the other was a 30-minute walk. Turns out, Operator had put in the wrong address.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is exactly why OpenAI doesn’t give its agent your credit card number, passwords, or access to email. If OpenAI didn’t let me intervene here, Operator would’ve have wasted hundreds of dollars on a parking spot I didn’t need.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hallucinations like this are a key roadblock to actually useful autonomous agents – ones that can take bothersome tasks off your plate. No one will trust agents if they’re prone to making basic mistakes, especially mistakes with real-world consequences.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Operator, OpenAI seems to have built some impressive tools to let AI systems browse the web. But these tools won’t amount to much until the underpinning AI can reliably do what users ask it to do. Until then, humans will be stuck assisting agents — not the other way around. And that kind of defeats the point.</p>\n</div>",

The company said on Tuesday that the model can produce high-resolution images in around 1.4 seconds on an iPhone 16 Pro Max. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new diffusion model runs entirely on the device, which reduces computational costs compared to models that rely on large servers. Snap notes that the model can create “stunning” visual results by “transferring rich representations from large-scale diffusion models to this smaller and more efficient model.”</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snap plans to bring the technology into production in the coming months to help power the app’s AI Snaps, AI Bitmoji Backgrounds, and more. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says that by implementing this in-house technology, it will be able to offer its community high-quality AI tools at a lower operating cost. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Snap has a long history of research excellence in model optimization and efficiency,” the company said in a blog post. “We are inspired by the industry innovation that is making AI tools more efficient, affordable, and accessible and we look forward to continuing to contribute to the rapid pace of innovation, particularly for mobile-first experiences.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company didn’t share any further details about the model but noted that it’s the continuation of its long-term investment in AI and ML technologies.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Snap has tapped AI tools from companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/27/snapchat-launches-an-ai-chatbot-powered-by-openais-gpt-technology/\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/24/snapchat-taps-googles-gemini-to-power-its-chatbots-generative-ai-features/\">Google</a> in the past to power some of its features, it has now debuted its own in-house AI model that will allow it to offer unique features to its users. It makes sense for the company to invest in AI and develop its own model, especially since nearly every tech company, including Meta, has been doing so over the past few years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snap is scheduled to release its Q4 2024 earnings report on Tuesday. </p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Video reigns supreme on social media like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. And now, video is becoming a bigger business for LinkedIn. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Microsoft-owned social network for the working world has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/27/linkedin-is-experimenting-with-a-tiktok-like-video-feed-in-its-app/\">yet to go full TikTok</a>. But with a big boost of usage — today it said that video uploads jumped by 36% compared to last year, while video creation on the platform itself grew 100% — LinkedIn is adding in more features to woo more video activity: a new full-screen vertical video display for all users (not just those on mobile), along with a number of new tools to boost viewer engagement. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The updates a week after Microsoft reported earnings that disclosed LinkedIn <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/29/linkedin-passes-2b-in-premium-revenues-in-12-months-with-overall-revenues-up-9-on-the-year/\">growing revenues by 9%</a> in the last year (with premium subscriptions passing $2 billion in revenue). </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company now has over 1 billion users, so it’s a sure bet that in its drive to make more money, it will also be leaning into economies of scale around advertising and paid features. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Video will inevitably be a major component of that because of the stickiness and popularity of the medium, not just generally on social media but on LinkedIn in particular: last week it <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/linkedins-video-push-appears-to-be-working-in-2025/\" rel=\"nofollow\">disclosed</a> that video viewership was up 36% on last year.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new vertical video feed for web pages is a natural development, given that LinkedIn had already been seeing strong engagement with that format on mobile, where it had <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a6290168\" rel=\"nofollow\">first launched</a>. As with the mobile experience, the new vertical web experience will allow people to select single videos, and then swipe or click from them to more videos in their feed.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is not — yet — a full-screen player for video a la TikTok or Instagram. We first reported on that test in March 2024, and LinkedIn confirms this remains in test and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7275224371206504449/\" rel=\"nofollow\">feedback</a> mode.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, it appears LinkedIn is going ahead and rolling out a number of features in aid of that future experience. For example, users will now see a new profile preview feature to see a creator’s profile without leaving the video, with a much more prominent follow button appearing in the interface. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LinkedIn is also adding more video content into its search results, with a new video carousel appearing alongside other links. (It will be facinating to see how many opt for these results rather than text-based ones.)</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are also some analytics being developed for creators, who will be able to track average watch times for their content. This is a small step but a signal that we’re likely to see more analytics features emerge in the coming months — especially if a full video feed makes its way to general release. </p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">There are plenty of pedometer and step counter apps in the world, but this new app has a fun twist. <a href=\"https://www.cromulentlabs.com/walkstar/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Walkstar</a>, which <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/walkstar-move-groove/id6736508282\" rel=\"nofollow\">launched Tuesday in the App Store</a>, enhances your workout by syncing your tunes with your movement. The moment you pause, the music fades away, making it a perfect motivator for those looking to maintain an active lifestyle.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When you start walking or running for at least 10 seconds, the music begins to play. If the app detects that you’ve stopped moving, the music will also stop. It will resume playing once you start moving again.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app was created by Greg Gardner, who previously developed <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/launcher-with-multiple-widgets/id905099592\" rel=\"nofollow\">Launcher</a>, the app-launching widget that allows iPhone users to launch an app, perform an action, or access a website with one tap.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gardner shared with TechCrunch that he got the idea for Walkstar after observing someone online who combined an old Sony Walkman with a pedometer. This allowed the device to play music only while the user was walking. (Unfortunately, we were unable to locate the original post.)</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I thought that was really clever and realized that the same thing could probably be accomplished with an iPhone app and that it could be a really nice motivational tool to encourage people to walk more,” Gardner said. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One particularly fun aspect of Walkstar is its retro-style interface, which transforms your phone into a colorful portable cassette player, reminiscent of an old-school Walkman. A nostalgic touch is added with a sound tape hiss that plays when the music starts.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2958966\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1200\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_song.png?w=315\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_song.png 555w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_song.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_song.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_song.png?resize=315,680 315w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_song.png?resize=199,430 199w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_song.png?resize=333,720 333w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_song.png?resize=416,900 416w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_song.png?resize=370,800 370w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_song.png?resize=309,668 309w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_song.png?resize=173,375 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_song.png?resize=285,617 285w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_song.png?resize=246,531 246w\" width=\"555\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Cromulent Labs</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other neat features include Game Center integration to view leaderboards and achievements. There’s also a Live Activity widget for tracking step count and distance, as well as Shortcuts integration for starting and stopping walking sessions, among other features.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app is available to download for free, but there’s also a Premium subscription if you want to customize the app with colorful app icons and cassette tape covers. Additionally, Premium members can view analytics, including their overall step count and walking history.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the future, Gardner plans to introduce more features that will enable people to share their progress and compete with friends. If the app gains sufficient popularity, he may also consider developing an Android version.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2958968\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1200\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_steps-1.png?w=315\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_steps-1.png 555w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_steps-1.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_steps-1.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_steps-1.png?resize=315,680 315w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_steps-1.png?resize=199,430 199w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_steps-1.png?resize=333,720 333w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_steps-1.png?resize=416,900 416w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_steps-1.png?resize=370,800 370w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_steps-1.png?resize=309,668 309w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_steps-1.png?resize=173,375 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_steps-1.png?resize=285,617 285w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/walkstar_steps-1.png?resize=246,531 246w\" width=\"555\"/></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s important to note that Walkstar is currently only compatible with Apple services, including Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, Apple Books, and iTunes. Users can also listen to music that they manually load onto their devices via the Apple Music app.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gardner is exploring the possibility of adding more music-streaming integrations, with Spotify being the first target. A test version featuring Spotify is currently under review in the App Store.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Hopefully, it gets approved in the next few months,” Gardner stated.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Canada’s StackAdapt snaps up $235M for its AI-based programmatic platform",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">While the U.S. and Canada duke it out over tariffs between the two countries, a tech company based out of Toronto is announcing a major round of funding led by a homegrown VC. <a href=\"https://www.stackadapt.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">StackAdapt</a>, a programmatic advertising startup, says that it has raised $235 million in equity funding, with Teachers’ Venture Growth (TVG) — the investment arm of the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan — leading the growth round. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Intrepid Growth Partners, a firm based between Toronto and London, is also participating, along with four other investors that are not being named. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The funding is significant both for its size and its focus. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In terms of the size, this is one of the bigger funding rounds for a startup out of Canada to date — although it’s not the biggest. Most recently, Fintech Clio <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/23/clio-raises-900m-at-a-3b-valuation-plans-to-double-down-on-ai-and-fintech/\">raised $900 million</a>; Cohere <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/22/cohere-raises-500m-to-beat-back-generative-ai-rivals/\">raised $500 million</a>, and Tenstorrent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/02/jeff-bezos-backs-ai-chipmaker-tenstorrent/\">raised $700 million</a>, all last year. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Funding for Canadian startups is largely reflecting trends that are playing out in other markets. The total number of deals in <a href=\"https://thelogic.co/news/why-axis/canada-canada-vc-q4-2024-ai-startups/\" rel=\"nofollow\">2024</a> was down on the year before, with companies working in the area of artificial intelligence taking an outsized part of what was getting invested.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">StackAdapt, which describes itself as a company that “harnesses the power of AI”, is arguably a part of trend. The company launched in 2014 and had more or less grown as a quietly bootstrapped company. That was until 2022, when it took a $300 million investment from Summit Partners. <a href=\"https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/93668-23/company/profile#general-info\" rel=\"nofollow\">PitchBook data</a> indicates that at least some of that $300 million was in the form of a secondary investment. From what we understand it was a minority investment, which would put the company’s valuation at above $600 million.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is not disclosing valuation with this current round.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The size of this round speaks not only to the company’s size today, but also notably how it’s financing the next stage of its growth with local backing. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Programmatic advertising has become, effectively, the building block of how all digital advertising works these days accounting for upwards of 90% of the market, the reason being that it gives marketers a more effective way of measuring how their ads are working, and to whom those ads are being shown; and it gives publishers a more automated way of bringing in a larger volume of ads against their content. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the case of StackAdapt, the company offers customers across different business verticals — for example, political campaigns, retailers, B2B, travel, healthcare and financial services — and its inventory includes native advertising (sponsored content), display, video, connected TV, audio, games and more. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Developments like the rise of AI (along with other kinds of automation) have shifted the landscape for programmatic advertising, leading to potentially higher incidents of ad fraud. Other issues that programmatic advertising faces include more difficulty controlling brand safety and data protection, given the amount of data used to power its ad targeting. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s the challenge but also opportunity for companies like StackAdapt. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>“</strong>Following the 2022–2023 lull, companies are shifting their focus toward growth and increasing their investments,” said Vitaly Pecherskiy, the CEO who co-founded the company with Yang Han, and Ildar Shar, in a statement to TechCrunch. “That said, growth at all costs is no longer the priority. Companies are looking for solutions to drive their business forward while prioritizing cost-effectiveness through automation and AI. As a result, we are seeing strong demand for our product.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">StackAdapt, he said has built its AI on “a decade of experience analyzing ad traffic patterns and understanding their evolution,” which it uses to help combat ad fraud and bot traffic.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are proud to support StackAdapt, a leading Canadian technology company, on its trajectory to becoming the global leader in AI-driven, end-to-end advertising,” said Rick Prostko, senior managing director of TVG, in a statement. “The company has been able to demonstrate consistent growth and profitability while building the future of advertising and marketing technology. We have been impressed by their exceptional team, visionary leadership, and relentless focus on delivering customer value.” </p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">The fashion industry has concerned Emily Gittins since adolescence. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sector is, after all, one of the most polluting in the world. According to some sources, it is responsible for nearly 10% of the <a href=\"https://earth.org/fast-fashions-detrimental-effect-on-the-environment/\" rel=\"nofollow\">earth’s CO2 emissions</a> and <a href=\"https://blogs.gwu.edu/law-gwpointsource/2023/10/02/fast-fashion-polluting-our-water-millions-of-clothing-items-at-a-time/\" rel=\"nofollow\">more than 20%</a> of all water waste. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet people still want more, fast. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The way we consume today is hugely problematic,” Gittins told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2021, Gittins teamed up with Ryan Rowe to launch Archive, a company that provides software to fashion brands and merchants so they can create resale platforms <a href=\"https://www.archiveresale.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-resale-models\" rel=\"nofollow\">tailored to each business’s</a> wants and needs, including a spot where people can sell used clothes to each other. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Competitors include Trove and Treet, which also creates online resale software for brands to sell used items. Archive says its product is different because it can support global brands across various continents. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Archive’s features include smart pricing and product feeds; and warehouse management to handle intake, processing, repair, and fulfillment; it also provides tools to analyze profits and costs and allows brands to connect it to their own tools and share data. Archive already works with more than 50 brands, including New Balance, The North Face, and Oscar de la Renta, Gittins says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is a massive opportunity in the general second-hand market, which is expected to<a href=\"https://www.retaildive.com/news/resale-secondhand-apparel-market-growth-projections/711476/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> hit $73 billion</a> by 2028 in the U.S. alone, according to the resale report by retailer ThreadUp. That share of the fashion industry is only expected to increase, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/27/secondhand-clothing-on-track-to-take-10-of-global-fashion-sales\" rel=\"nofollow\">as the Guardian reported</a>, especially among young people and anyone else looking for more eco, and budget-friendly options. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s what convinced VCs to invest a $30 million Series B, led by Energize Capital. Other investors include Lightspeed Venture Partners, G9 Ventures, and Bain Capital. Archive has raised $54 million in total funding to date. Archive will use the new funding to further develop its resale software and more product innovation. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another good sign for the clothing resale industry is <a href=\"https://www.archiveresale.com/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-latest-us-sustainable-fashion-policy\" rel=\"nofollow\">growing legislation in a number of states </a>that encourages it, like California’s new Responsible Textile Recovery Act, and well as similar legislation in<a href=\"https://www.archiveresale.com/blog/your-complete-guide-to-sustainable-fashion-policy-in-europe\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Europe</a>. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve debunked the concern that resale cannibalizes full-price scales,” Gittins added. “We’re in scaling mode with many of our brands and are excited to be launching resale businesses for so many new brands in 2025.” </p>\n</div>",

The company provides solutions like salary advances, digital payments, and microloans to help employees and contractors access much-needed financial services.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khazna recently secured $16 million in pre-Series B funding, bringing its total funding to over $63 million. The investment will support its expansion plans as it prepares to apply for a digital banking license in Egypt and expand into Saudi Arabia.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When we covered the fintech in 2022, it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/31/egyptian-financial-super-app-khazna-raises-38m-from-quona-capital-and-lendable/\">had just raised $38 million</a> pre-Series A with over 150,000 customers across its products. Today, Khazna has grown its user base to over 500,000 people; that number is half what it was targeting twice by the end of 2022, according to what Saleh shared at the time.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company focuses on workers earning three times less than Egypt’s minimum wage, providing them with affordable financial tools. About 100,000 users receive their payroll through Khazna, allowing the company to integrate financial services such as loans and insurance directly into their payroll accounts.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For the remaining 400,000 users, Khazna offers lending services, helping gig workers and pensioners access credit. CEO Omar Saleh explained that the company initially focused on payroll-backed credit and pension lending, contributing to its break-even last month. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What we did over the last two and half years was to focus on our core product, which is credit offering to payroll and pension recipients and also unsecured loans to gig workers,” co-founder and CEO Omar Saleh told TechCrunch on a call. “This is the most profitable and core product in our journey, and getting it right was very important because it has helped us to hit profitability.”</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-techcrunch wp-block-embed-techcrunch\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"tXKbrfEl4A\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/31/egyptian-financial-super-app-khazna-raises-38m-from-quona-capital-and-lendable/\">Egyptian financial super app Khazna raises $38M from Quona Capital and Lendable</a></blockquote><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"tXKbrfEl4A\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"282\" loading=\"lazy\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" scrolling=\"no\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/31/egyptian-financial-super-app-khazna-raises-38m-from-quona-capital-and-lendable/embed/#?secret=wRwe8u0ueT#?secret=tXKbrfEl4A\" style=\"position: absolute; visibility: hidden;\" title=\"“Egyptian financial super app Khazna raises $38M from Quona Capital and Lendable” — TechCrunch\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-on-the-path-to-becoming-a-digital-bank\">On the path to becoming a digital bank</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khazna provides other services like bill payments, buy now, pay later, medical insurance, and a rent-to-own product. But by embedding itself into both payroll and lending, it is strategically moving toward becoming a full-fledged digital bank for Egypt’s underserved communities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But one thing is missing: unlike traditional banks, Khazna, like many fintechs in Egypt, doesn’t have access to customer deposits, making it expensive to fund loans. So far, Khazna has relied on wholesale debt financing in dollars (USD) and the Egyptian pound (EGP) to fund its lending operations.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To reduce borrowing costs and offer more affordable loans, Khazna is now working to obtain a deposit-taking license in Egypt. This license would allow the startup to accept customer deposits, allowing it to lower its cost of funds. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The biggest game changer here is for us to get access to user deposits. There’s a huge opportunity for us to capture part of that market as well in a way that will make our cost of funding much more attractive than it is today, and ultimately, that would put us in a very differentiated position,” he remarked. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khazna is targeting mid-2026 to secure the banking license from Egypt’s Central Bank, which laid out its regulatory framework for digital banks in July 2024.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But as the six-year-old fintech gets started with that process, it’s simultaneously setting sights on Saudi Arabia, where there is a growing demand for consumer finance solutions. Unlike BNPL players like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/31/buy-now-pay-later-platform-tabby-nabs-200m-in-series-d-funding-at-1-5b-valuation/\">Tabby</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/18/saudi-shopping-and-bnpl-platform-tamara-tops-1b-valuation-in-340m-series-c-funding/\">Tamara</a>, which focus on short-term BNPL credit, Khazna hopes to differentiate itself with medium-term credit products like earned wage access (EWA), payroll-backed lending, and pension-based credit.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-expansion-plans-including-a-not-so-imminent-ipo\">Expansion plans, including a not-so-imminent IPO</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another reason Khazna is prioritizing Saudi is its strong connection with Egypt, Saleh notes. With nearly three million Egyptians living in Saudi, the Egypt-Saudi remittance corridor is one of the world’s largest, presenting an opportunity to offer cross-border financial services, combining credit-led offerings with foreign exchange (FX) solutions. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond market size and product fit, Saudi Arabia’s capital markets are also a driver in Khazna’s decision, according to Saleh. Tadawul is one of the region’s most liquid and retail-investor-driven stock exchanges, launching several IPOs over the past couple of years.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For that reason, Khazna plans to have 40-50% of its business coming from Saudi in the next four years, making it eligible for a public listing on Tadawul. For early-stage investors who have backed the company for four to five years, Saleh says this provides a clear path to a high-value exit.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sure, Khazna will fund this expansion with the recently raised growth capital. However, the macroeconomic challenges in Egypt over the past two years had a hand in structuring this pre-Series B round.   </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Between 2022 and 2023, Egypt faced currency devaluations and economic instability, making fundraising more difficult for startups and ventures. The overall slowdown in deal flow reflected this, as investors took a cautious approach to Egyptian startups. But 2024 brought a major shift, with over $50 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) flowing into Egypt following economic reforms and a more flexible exchange rate. As a result, investor confidence returned, bringing renewed interest from global and regional investors.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As such, Khazna welcomed participation from new and existing investors, including global investors like Quona and Speedinvest, as well as regional financial institutions and investment firms like SANAD Fund for MSME, anb Seed Fund (managed by anb Capital), Aljazira Capital (the investment arm of Bank Aljazira of Saudi Arabia), Tibas Ventures (the venture capital arm of İşbank of Turkey), Khwarizmi Ventures, Nclude (the fintech fund set up by Egypt’s largest national banks) and ICU Ventures. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">On the heels of Chinese AI firm DeepSeek making a huge splash in OpenAI’s American backyard, OpenAI is diving into expanding in Asia, with major commercial deals that will also help it train its AI on more Asian-language content and user behavior — a gateway to doing more business in these markets in the future on its own.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, OpenAI unveiled a strategic collaboration with Kakao, the South Korea tech company that operates one of the region’s most popular messaging apps, KakaoTalk. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes one day after SoftBank also <a href=\"https://group.softbank/en/news/press/20250203_0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> a major commitment to using OpenAI: it has allocated a budget of $3 billion to deploy OpenAI tech across its various group operations and subsidiaries, as well as establish a joint venture, SB OpenAI Japan, to build solutions customized for enterprises in the country.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today’s Kakao news was announced earlier today at an event in Seoul co-led by Kakao CEO Shina Chung and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and it will initially cover <a href=\"https://www.kakaocorp.com/page/detail/11451\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">three projects</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The companies plan to develop a new Korean-language assistant called Kanana powered by OpenAI; OpenAI tech will be integrated into KakaoTalk; and Kakao will also become a customer of OpenAI’s, using ChatGPT Enterprise internally among its employees.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, the SoftBank announcement is just the latest development of what looks like a pretty deep-looking relationship between the two companies. SoftBank is also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/29/softbank-in-talks-to-invest-as-much-as-25b-in-openai-report-says/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly</a> eyeing up a major investment in OpenAI — yet to be confirmed — and the two are in theory also working together on the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/23/openai-and-softbank-are-reportedly-putting-19b-each-into-stargate/\">Stargate</a> project to build AI superservers and other infrastructure in the U.S..</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the surface, both of these partnerships are big commercial deals that will bring OpenAI services to new populations in their home languages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Kakao has a deep understanding of how technology can enrich everyday lives, and they’ve consistently delivered innovative experiences for their users,” Altman said in a statement. “We’re excited to bring advanced AI to Kakao’s millions of users and work together to integrate our technology into services that transform how Kakao’s users communicate and connect.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But beyond that, in both the case of Kako and SoftBank, the deals will benefit OpenAI in another very significant way. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.S. company continues to build out and train its Large Language Models. Deals with major players in Korea and Japan, with their access to millions of consumers in their respective markets, gives OpenAI an opportunity to unlock new linguistic doors. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is especially important given DeepSeek. If the Chinese AI company proves to be more than just a viral flash in the pan — and it doesn’t get buried under a sea of legal issues around copyright, personal data protection, and more — it will have proven to be a very clear signal to OpenAI that a company building outside of the U.S. has stolen a march on capturing English-language generative AI momentum. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thus, OpenAI needs to continue to expand its reach internationally, too, and that includes in terms of its ability to work just as well in different languages as it does in English. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s notable too because SoftBank at one point saw a very different route, and opening, for itself. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Seizing the opportunity to build for its home language in an AI world largely dominated by English natural language services, in 2023, it announced a new company. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/04/softbank-launches-an-openai-for-japan-sb-intuitions-building-llms-and-generative-ai-in-japanese/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SB Intuitions</a> aimed to build LLMs and generative AI in Japanese. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear what is happening with that business — whether it never got off the ground, or whether that work will be rolled into the JV, or something else altogether. We have contacted the company and will update as we learn more.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apart from the collaboration with Kakao, Altman is using the moment to connect with other major Korean tech giants. He also took meetings with top executives at Samsung Electronics and Korean semiconductor maker SK Hynix to discuss custom-designed chips and AI-powered devices, <a href=\"http://Altman held meeting with execs at Samsung Electronics and Korean semiconductor maker SK Hynix to discuss its custom-designed chips and AI-powered devices, per a local media report.

The Japanese tech giant and OpenAI have set up “SB OpenAI Japan,” a JV that will exclusively offer the U.S. AI startup’s enterprise technology to large enterprises in Japan.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, OpenAI introduced <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/computer-using-agent/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Operator</a>, an agent capable of carrying out tasks like vacation planning and restaurant reservations on the web, and the <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">o3-mini</a>, the latest and most cost-effective reasoning model.
