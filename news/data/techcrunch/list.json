We have a zero-tolerance policy against such targeting and will terminate our relationship with any customer that violates our terms of service.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These comments come after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/whatsapp-says-it-disrupted-a-hacking-campaign-targeting-journalists-with-spyware/\">WhatsApp alleged on Friday that Paragon’s spyware was used in a hacking campaign</a> that targeted around 90 journalists and other members of civil society. Since then, at least two people have come forward claiming they were among the targets: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/journalist-targeted-on-whatsapp-by-paragon-spyware-i-feel-violated/\">Italian journalist Francesco Cancellato</a>, and Sweden-based Libyan activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/03/critic-of-italy-libya-migration-pact-told-he-was-target-of-israeli-spyware\" rel=\"nofollow\">Husam El Gomati</a>. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fleming did not respond to a series of specific questions, including asking for more details about who Paragon considers to be a U.S. ally and a democracy; what exactly its terms of service say about the prohibition of targeting journalists and members of civil society with its spyware; whether the company can and does investigate allegations of abuse, such as those made by WhatsApp; whether the company is investigating WhatsApp’s allegations; and if Paragon has ever terminated a contract because of such violations.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\"> </p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about Paragon Solutions?

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Cybersecurity company SailPoint is hoping to go public — again. This time, the company plans to sell $1 billion worth of stock and hit an $11.5 billion valuation in its planned IPO.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s how the math works out for a proposed offering it <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250204490452/en/SailPoint-Announces-Launch-of-Initial-Public-Offering\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> Tuesday of 47.5 million shares, at between $19 to $21.  SailPoint’s owner, Thoma Bravo, plans to also sell 2.5 million shares.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SailPoint offers identity management wares to enterprises and is a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/okta-lays-off-180-employees-nearly-one-year-after-last-workforce-reduction/\">competitor to $16 billion market-cap Okta</a>. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t Sailpoint’s first time as a public company. It was publicly traded until Thoma Bravo took SailPoint private in 2022, valuing it at $6.9 billion at the time. The private equity giant will still own over 87% of the company after the IPO.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2030781/000119312525019604/d885522ds1a.htm#rom885522_7\" rel=\"nofollow\">said in its S-1 filing</a> that it’s on track for $813 annual recurring revenue, as of October. SailPoint reported annual net losses of just over $395 million on about $700 million in revenues as of January 2024; the company said it has more than $1 billion in debt, with its balance sheet showing debt of $1.5 billion. SailPoint said it will use the proceeds to address its debt, as well as fund operations.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the financial sophistication of SailPoint’s owners, the stock may very price above that range, and easily bypass that hoped-for cash haul and valuation.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founder Mark McClain, who stayed on as CEO after Thoma Bravo acquired the company, still has a relatively tiny stake of just over 3.6 million shares. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Not many founding CEOs find themselves in a position to introduce their company to the public market for a second time, but I am grateful to be able to do precisely that,” he remarked in his <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2030781/000119312525019604/d885522ds1a.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">prospectus letter</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because SailPoint isn’t a startup, this IPO, which could happen next week, won’t be a boon for any venture capitalists. But the success of the offering will be closely watched by them. VCs and startups are still reading the tea leaves on the timing to bring <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/01/here-are-all-the-ipos-reported-to-be-in-the-works-for-2025/\">their many IPO-ready tech startups public</a>. Should retail investors gobble the stock, this will be another signal that 2025 could be a good year to not just open a window, but a door.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then again, even if investors are hungry for this IPO, other factors could slow other offerings. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stock-market-stocks-djia-dow-jones-sp500-trump-tariffs-impact/plan\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wall Street grew plenty nervous</a> over the Trump Administration’s plans to start a North America tariff trade war, although those plans have now been postponed for at least a month. Should policy events keep rattling the markets, tech startups may just continue to stay under cover. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Figure AI founder and CEO Brett Adcock <a href=\"https://x.com/adcock_brett/status/1886860098980733197\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced Tuesday</a> that the humanoid robotics firm is exiting a deal with OpenAI. The Bay Area-based robotics company has instead opted to focus on in-house AI, owing to a “major breakthrough.” Adcock was tightlipped in terms of specifics, but he promised to deliver “something no one has ever seen on a humanoid” in the next 30 days.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI has been a longtime investor in Figure. The pair <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/29/figure-rides-the-humanoid-robot-hype-wave-to-2-6b-valuation-and-openai-collab/\">announced a deal</a> last year that aimed to “develop next generation AI models for humanoid robots.” At the same time, Figure announced a $675 million raise, valuing the company at $2.6 billion. Figure has so far raised a total of $1.5 billion.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news is a surprise, in part, given the cultural zeitgeist OpenAI has built by mainstreaming generative AI. Mere association with the company comes with a rapid profile boost. In August, the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/06/figures-new-humanoid-robot-leverages-openai-for-natural-speech-conversations/\">two companies announced</a> that the Figure 02 humanoid would use OpenAI models for natural language communication.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The issue with the collaboration, according to Adcock, is integration. OpenAI is a huge company with a massive breadth — and the intelligence models to match. Embodied AI, which brings artificial intelligence to physical objects such as robots, isn’t the ChatGPT maker’s primary focus. Instead, the executive suggests, the proper solution is building an end-to-end AI model focused on powering specific hardware.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We found that to solve embodied AI at scale in the real world, you have to vertically integrate robot AI,” Adcock tells TechCrunch. “We can’t outsource AI for the same reason we can’t outsource our hardware.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI has notably hedged its bets in the humanoid space. The firm was also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/27/openai-backed-1x-acquires-kind-humanoid/\">a major backer of 1X</a>. While the majority of humanoid firms are focused on warehouses and factories, the Norwegian startup has shifted much of its own focus on the home. On a trip to Figure’s Sunnyvale office <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/12/face-to-face-with-figures-new-humanoid-robot/\">last September</a>, Adcock told TechCrunch that the company is also exploring the use of its systems in a home setting.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That, however, is not the priority for Figure. After all, automakers have deeper pockets than individuals when it comes to exploring new technology. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/18/bmw-will-deploy-figures-humanoid-robot-at-south-carolina-plant/\">BMW announced</a> last year that it had begun deploying Figure robots at a South Carolina factory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI may also be exploring its own humanoid hardware. On Friday, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/openais-new-trademark-application-hints-at-humanoid-robots-smart-jewelry-and-more/\">the company filed</a> a trademark application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) involving humanoids. The text references both “user-programmable humanoid robots” and “humanoid robots having communication and learning functions for assisting and entertaining people.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While intriguing, however, IP filings are not a guarantee of future products. Even so, it’s difficult to ignore these two pieces of news arriving in under a week. Figure’s massive funding rounds, meanwhile, have allowed it to quickly expand both its hardware and software teams. The company recently moved into a larger Bay Area office to accommodate  its rapidly growing staff.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When it comes to proprietary software, there’s a lot to be said for the Apple ecosystem approach to product development. It’s an effective way to create software that works especially well with your hardware systems. It is, however, both difficult and very resource intensive.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most humanoid firms are working on their own bespoke AI models to differing degrees. Partnerships are still prevalent in the industry, however. In October, Boston Dynamics <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/boston-dynamics-teams-with-tri-to-bring-ai-smarts-to-atlas-humanoid-robot/\">announced</a> that it has been working with Toyota Research Institute (TRI) to bring artificial smarts to the Atlas humanoid robot.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI for comment.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">A group of developers at AI dev platform Hugging Face, including Thomas Wolf, the company’s co-founder and chief scientist, say they’ve built an “open” version of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/02/openai-unveils-a-new-chatgpt-agent-for-deep-research/\">OpenAI’s deep research tool</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deep research, which OpenAI unveiled during an event Sunday, crawls the web to compile research reports on any subject. While impressive, deep research is currently only available in limited preview to users subscribed to OpenAI’s $200-a-month ChatGPT Pro plan. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Hugging Face team’s project, which they’re calling Open Deep Research, consists of an AI model — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/05/openais-o1-model-sure-tries-to-deceive-humans-a-lot/\">OpenAI’s o1</a> — and an open source “agentic framework” that helps the model plan its analysis and guides it to use tools like search engines. O1 is a proprietary model (i.e. gated behind a paid API), but the team says it delivered better performance than “open” models such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/27/deepseek-claims-its-reasoning-model-beats-openais-o1-on-certain-benchmarks/\">DeepSeek’s R1</a>. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In less than 24 hours, the researchers were able to harness o1 to use a simple, text-based browser and a “text inspector” toolkit to read files across the web. Open Deep Research can navigate the web autonomously, the team says, scrolling through pages, manipulating files, and even running calculations with data. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On GAIA, a benchmark for general AI assistants, Open Deep Research achieves a score of 54%. That’s compared with OpenAI deep research’s score of 67.36%. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I tried Open Deep Research in <a href=\"https://m-ric-open-deep-research.hf.space/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the public demo</a> the team set up — but couldn’t get it to work. The page was under heavy load at publication time; after 10 minutes, it spit out an error message.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the researchers say that they’re committed to improving the experience, and have made the <a href=\"https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/tree/gaia-submission-r1/examples/open_deep_research\" rel=\"nofollow\">source code available on GitHub</a> for inspection and feedback. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Worth noting is that there are <a href=\"https://x.com/nickscamara_/status/1886459999905521912\" rel=\"nofollow\">a number of</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/dzhng/status/1886603396578484630\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenAI deep research “reproductions”</a> on the web, some of which rely on open models and tooling. The crucial component they — and Open Deep Research — lack is o3, the model underpinning deep research. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Few, if any, models beat <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/openai-launches-o3-mini-its-latest-reasoning-model/\">o3</a> on benchmarks related to answering complex questions and information gathering. Short of an open model to rival o3, deep research alternatives may not quite measure up to the real thing.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Renewables notched another win as Amazon signed contracts to buy 476 megawatts of wind and solar on the Iberian Peninsula. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The power purchase agreements with multinational utility Iberdrola should help Amazon feed new data centers it has planned in the region. Last May, the company said it would invest <a href=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/aws-to-invest-157-billion-into-spain-announces-600mw-in-renewable-energy-projects/\" rel=\"nofollow\">$17 billion</a> in infrastructure projects, including data centers, in Spain.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon’s power bill has been soaring lately as it adds data centers to deal with rising demand for AI and cloud services.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the projects that Amazon is buying into — the Tâmega wind farm — is being built alongside a massive hydroelectric dam system in Portugal. The complex consists of a total of three dams, one of which is an 880-megawatt pumped-storage dam. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pumped-storage facilities have two reservoirs, one higher in elevation, one lower. When power is needed, water is released from the upper reservoir to spin turbines. When there’s excess power, massive pumps shift water from the lower reservoir to the upper one. Pumped storage is, in effect, a massive battery.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 274-megawatts of wind turbines being installed at Tâmega will feed power to the grid through the hydro complex’s existing connection, and when there’s excess, it can be used to pump water to the upper reservoir. Such hybrid installations ensure power can be fed to the grid consistently from otherwise intermittent renewable resources like wind and solar.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon is also buying a portion of the power from more typical wind and solar plants in northwestern Spain. Last year, the company was the largest buyer of renewable power. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tech companies have been buying power from renewable projects at a fairly consistent pace, driven in part by how quickly and inexpensively wind, solar, and batteries can be installed. Last month, Meta said that it had signed two large <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/meta-turns-to-solar-again-in-its-data-center-building-boom/\">deals for solar power</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/12/microsoft-anchors-9b-renewable-energy-coalition/\">Microsoft</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/10/google-kicks-off-20b-renewable-energy-building-spree-to-power-ai/\">Google</a> previously announced that they were each backing multi-billion dollar renewable investments.</p>\n</div>",

It is, in some ways, like this generation’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2008/03/14/friendfeed-is-this-years-twitter-but-why/\">FriendFeed</a>, for those old enough to remember the earlier attempt from the Web 2.0 era to aggregate feeds and social media updates in a single destination for discovery and discussion.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But while FriendFeed encouraged discussions on-site, building a social network of its own — and ultimately attracting an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/facebook-acquires-friendfeed/\">acquisition</a> by Facebook — Tapestry works better as a reader.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The problem the app addresses is one that’s becoming more common as the open social web grows: In order to keep up, people have to use tons of services and do so much app-switching.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amid a flurry of development that includes the growing social networks <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/what-is-bluesky-everything-to-know-about-the-x-competitor/\">Bluesky</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/24/what-is-mastodon/\">Mastodon</a>, designed to rival the tech giants with open source software and decentralized power structures, there is also the challenge of keeping up with friends and followers who have now scattered across numerous places after leaving X’s and Meta’s platforms.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2959568\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1187\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone-flat.png?w=412\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone-flat.png 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone-flat.png?resize=91,150 91w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone-flat.png?resize=182,300 182w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone-flat.png?resize=412,680 412w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone-flat.png?resize=261,430 261w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone-flat.png?resize=437,720 437w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone-flat.png?resize=546,900 546w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone-flat.png?resize=485,800 485w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone-flat.png?resize=405,668 405w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone-flat.png?resize=227,375 227w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone-flat.png?resize=374,617 374w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone-flat.png?resize=322,531 322w\" style=\"width:376px;height:auto\" width=\"720\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Tapestry</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Addressing this problem is Tapestry’s main draw but this could, for the time being, also limit the app’s appeal beyond the early-adopter crowd.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-unified-app\">A unified app</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, most people already have processes, workflows, and preferred apps they use to keep up with news sites, blogs, podcasts, and YouTube videos from favorite creators. Tapestry proposes to change that. It offers a single place to check for these updates alongside those from other social networks you may use, like Bluesky, Mastodon, Tumblr, and others.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Built by the team that designed one of the original third-party Twitter clients, Twitterrific, Tapestry proposes to introduce a new type of timeline, much like Twitter’s, where all updates scroll by. There are also additional, more advanced tools you can use to configure that timeline — like selecting which content to mute and which to “muffle,” or collapse — so you can opt to view it if desired while limiting screen space.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latter can be used to improve both the aesthetics and the vibe of your timeline. For instance, you may want to muffle political topics so they don’t overwhelm your screen as you scroll or muffle spoilers of your favorite TV shows. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2959577\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"2868\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1320px) 100vw, 1320px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0608.png?w=313\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0608.png 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0608.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0608.png?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0608.png?resize=768,1669 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0608.png?resize=313,680 313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0608.png?resize=552,1200 552w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0608.png?resize=589,1280 589w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0608.png?resize=198,430 198w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0608.png?resize=331,720 331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0608.png?resize=414,900 414w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0608.png?resize=368,800 368w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0608.png?resize=707,1536 707w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0608.png?resize=943,2048 943w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0608.png?resize=307,668 307w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0608.png?resize=173,375 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0608.png?resize=284,617 284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0608.png?resize=244,531 244w\" style=\"width:283px;height:auto\" width=\"1320\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Iconfactory</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After adding the social accounts, RSS feeds, blogs, podcasts, and more that you want to view within Tapestry, you can then set up your timeline, as well as additional timelines, offering a custom view of this information. For instance, you could have a timeline focused only on Apple news, blogs, and podcasts, or one for your social networks, like Bluesky and Mastodon.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To get the best use out of Tapestry, you’ll have to give a lot of thought to the type of information and updates you want to track and how you’d like to see them organized. Viewing everything in a single feed can be noisy because of all the social app updates. Your timelines are essentially Tapestry’s version of custom feeds (similar to Bluesky’s feeds, but with the ability to pull from multiple services, not just one). That means you’ll be in the job of feed creator, not just consumer — at least until a more robust developer ecosystem arrives.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-feeds-and-connectors\">Feeds and Connectors</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it feels like Tapestry is trying to scratch an itch that open social web early adopters may now have, its aggregation of all your content into timelines can feel overcomplicated at times, and some of its user interface choices need more polish.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2959580\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"2868\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1320px) 100vw, 1320px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0609.png?w=313\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0609.png 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0609.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0609.png?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0609.png?resize=768,1669 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0609.png?resize=313,680 313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0609.png?resize=552,1200 552w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0609.png?resize=589,1280 589w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0609.png?resize=198,430 198w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0609.png?resize=331,720 331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0609.png?resize=414,900 414w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0609.png?resize=368,800 368w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0609.png?resize=707,1536 707w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0609.png?resize=943,2048 943w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0609.png?resize=307,668 307w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0609.png?resize=173,375 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0609.png?resize=284,617 284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0609.png?resize=244,531 244w\" style=\"width:283px;height:auto\" width=\"1320\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Opening a Bluesky link in-app before being logged in</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Iconfactory</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, Tapestry defaults to opening feeds in-app when you choose the option to “open original” from the “more” (three-dot) menu on individual posts. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Also, tucking away the ability to engage with the original content with an extra tap doesn’t make this the best app for people who like to quickly participate in social conversations as they scroll. If you open items in-app, you’ll need to log in to the social network to engage. You’ll likely want to set this to open feeds in “Safari” so Tapestry opens the associated iOS app directly (like Bluesky) where you can like, reply, or repost.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unfortunately, that means Tapestry isn’t really solving the need to maintain multiple accounts across multiple apps.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another design choice that could be confusing involves the app’s two sections where you can add sources. One is called “Feeds” and another is called “Connectors.” The former lets you add “content that appears in your timeline,” and the latter is meant to “create feeds that populate your timeline.” (If you’re scratching your head at those descriptions, you’re not alone. The app needs to offer more of an explanation.)</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2959570\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"2868\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1320px) 100vw, 1320px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0607.jpg?w=313\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0607.jpg 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0607.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0607.jpg?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0607.jpg?resize=768,1669 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0607.jpg?resize=313,680 313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0607.jpg?resize=552,1200 552w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0607.jpg?resize=589,1280 589w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0607.jpg?resize=198,430 198w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0607.jpg?resize=331,720 331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0607.jpg?resize=414,900 414w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0607.jpg?resize=368,800 368w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0607.jpg?resize=707,1536 707w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0607.jpg?resize=943,2048 943w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0607.jpg?resize=307,668 307w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0607.jpg?resize=173,375 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0607.jpg?resize=284,617 284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0607.jpg?resize=244,531 244w\" style=\"width:278px;height:auto\" width=\"1320\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Tapestry’s settings: feeds and connectors</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As it turns out, Connectors are meant to work more like plug-ins or add-ons. They run in a <a href=\"https://iconfactory.happyfox.com/kb/article/145-security-and-privacy-of-tapestry-connectors/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">JavaScript sandbox</a> and will be built by a community of <a href=\"https://iconfactory.happyfox.com/kb/article/147-managing-custom-third-party-connectors/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">third-party developers</a> who want to extend the Tapestry ecosystem with new feeds of their own. Unfortunately, these Connectors can’t include sources like Facebook, Instagram, X, or others that don’t offer open feeds.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An extensible app is a clever idea but one that could have been pushed further down the project’s roadmap. Initially, the team should focus on testing the premise that users <em>want</em> to view information from across the web, not just the social web, as “timelines” in the first place. Do users <em>want</em> RSS, podcasts, social media, and other services mixed, instead of using separate apps?</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-transitional-step-or-the-future\">A transitional step or the future?</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tapestry isn’t the only one that’s thinking about putting users in control of their feeds and sources for news and information.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2959569\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1187\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone.jpeg?w=412\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone.jpeg 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone.jpeg?resize=91,150 91w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone.jpeg?resize=182,300 182w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone.jpeg?resize=412,680 412w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone.jpeg?resize=261,430 261w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone.jpeg?resize=437,720 437w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone.jpeg?resize=546,900 546w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone.jpeg?resize=485,800 485w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone.jpeg?resize=405,668 405w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone.jpeg?resize=227,375 227w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone.jpeg?resize=374,617 374w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/webyourway-phone.jpeg?resize=322,531 322w\" width=\"720\"/></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Newer social apps like Bluesky and even <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/as-bluesky-soars-threads-rolls-out-custom-feeds-globally/\">Meta’s Threads</a> introduced the concept of custom feeds, while startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/custom-feed-builder-graze-is-building-a-business-on-bluesky-and-investors-are-paying-attention/\">Graze offer advanced feed-building tools</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/18/flipboard-launches-surf-a-new-app-for-browsing-the-open-social-web/\">Flipboard introduced a new app called Surf</a> for building custom feeds from across services. Unlike Tapestry’s, Surf’s user interface lets you view feeds that can be filtered to be viewed in different formats — watch, read, or listen — or you can opt to see everything combined into one, depending on which tab you select.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other apps like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/11/feeeed-is-a-reader-app-that-goes-beyond-tracking-rss-feeds/\">Feeeed</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/23/the-new-reeder-app-is-built-for-rss-youtube-reddit-mastodon-and-more/\">Reeder</a> have also emerged to address similar issues around feed consumption.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One problem these solutions aim to address is that today’s open social networks work on different protocols. Mastodon, Pixelfed, and others use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ActivityPub</a>, and Bluesky and a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/01/here-are-the-apps-battling-to-be-become-the-tiktok-for-bluesky/\">growing number of clients</a> are building on its underlying protocol, <a href=\"https://docs.bsky.app/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">AT Protocol</a>. Meanwhile, older news sites, blogs, and podcasts distribute their updates across the open protocol <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">RSS</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/05/bluesky-and-mastodon-users-can-now-talk-to-each-other-with-bridgy-fed/\">bridges are being built</a> to connect networks like Bluesky and Mastodon, social apps like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/all-threads-users-can-now-share-to-the-open-social-web-aka-the-fediverse/\">Threads are integrating with ActivityPub</a>, while <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/11/wordpress-com-blogs-can-now-be-followed-on-mastodon-and-other-federated-platforms/\">WordPress blogs</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/substack-rival-ghost-confirms-it-will-join-the-fediverse-in-2024/\">newsletter platforms like Ghost</a> are working to join the open social web known as the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/welcome-to-the-fediverse-your-guide-to-mastodon-threads-bluesky-and-more/\">fediverse, via ActivityPub</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That leaves us in a transitional period where you can’t just pick your preferred app and expect to see it all. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, we’re being given tools to combine feeds and sources however we see fit.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">September 11 left a lasting impression on Stephen Beaton, and like many others of his generation, he joined the military.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But at the U.S. Air Force academy, his journey took a bit of a turn. There, his chemistry studies deepened his interest in liquid fuels. “As a product of September 11, seeing the spike in oil prices, I always thought, ‘how could we replace fossil fuels?’ I thought that it was important for national security.” </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beaton’s passion took him to Oxford for a PhD then back to the U.S. where he had a string of posts with the U.S. Air Force, including leading research projects, monitoring the quality of the branch’s fossil fuels, and overseeing R&amp;D investments in energy.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After leaving the military, Beaton wanted to found a company focused on, you guessed it, creating liquid fuels. “I’ve always been obsessed with fuels.” But there was one problem: “Fuel is a terrible first product,” he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Fuel is a commodity. It’s very cheap. The fossil fuel industry has had 150 years to really optimize for scale and cost,” Beaton added. “Your first product should be one that is like a high-margin luxury product — the Tesla Roadster approach. But ideally, it can’t be too far off of the path to making the fuel.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beaton says his startup, <a href=\"https://www.circularityfuels.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Circularity Fuels</a>, has found that market: lab-grown diamonds. Diamonds are pure carbon, and the chemical process used to make them requires methane that’s almost entirely free of impurities.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That methane typically sells anywhere from 100 to 300 times the price of natural gas,” he said, which is between $40,000 and $80,000 a ton.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Circularity makes methane by combining hydrogen with carbon from CO<sub>2</sub>. That idea isn’t novel, but the way the company goes about it is. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/27/lydian-labs-can-make-aviation-fuel-wherever-theres-co2-and-electricity/\">Plenty</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/21/e-fuels-startup-aether-fuels-is-raising-34-3-million-per-filing/\">of</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/03/oxylus-energy-strikes-beautiful-balance-to-make-e-fuels-for-aviation-and-shipping/\">companies</a> are attempting to transform captured carbon dioxide back into fuel, but the process is often too expensive to challenge fossil fuels on price. Beaton admits that Circularity can’t compete with most fossil fuels today, but if the company can scale its unique reactor, he thinks it has a chance in the near future.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup’s secret is a special catalyst that’s more selective, meaning it makes more of the target molecule, methane, and less of the unwanted stuff. And the special reactor it designed can capture carbon and make methane without needing separate vessels. The reactor can heat up quickly so the catalyst hits its peak efficiency faster, and it reuses waste heat from the reaction that creates methane to power the carbon capture equipment. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altogether, Circularity’s process uses 40% less energy than competing CO<sub>2</sub>-to-fuel pathways, Beaton said.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because the catalyst is so selective, Circularity can make 99.9999% pure methane at pilot scale cheaper than from fossil fuels, he said. “Even at the current hydrogen prices of $5,000 to $7,000 a ton, we’re profitable,” he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We envision taking those same concepts and scaling them up for methane, natural gas, synthetic natural gas, as well as other products,” Beaton said. The company wants to drive the price of e-fuels down to the point where they can steal market share from fossil fuels.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The reactor is designed to be modular, allowing methane and e-fuel to be made wherever it’s needed, saving on transportation costs and cutting greenhouse gas emissions from leaky infrastructure. That’s part of what drove the DCVCs investment, partner Zack Bogue told TechCrunch. “The current way of extracting and transporting natural gas is so leaky that we’re actually better off burning coal,” he said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Circularity was recently announced as an ARPA-E awardee, and the company is currently going through final contract negotiations. The company was incubated at DCVC, where Beaton is an entrepreneur-in-residence, and the firm provided pre-seed funding. Between ARPA-E and grants from the California Energy Commission, the National Science Foundation, and Stanford TomKat Center for Sustainable Energy, the company has received $4.9 million in grants and awards.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Meta’s Threads is doubling down on support for custom feeds as it faces challenges from the growing social network Bluesky, now with <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3lgu4lg6j2k2v\" rel=\"nofollow\">over 30 million users</a>, which also offers custom feeds as one of its key features. On Tuesday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/DFqPDLTyraz\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> that users can now set their custom feeds to be public and follow custom feeds made by others. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta thinks that its custom feeds are superior to others because they can be built without technical skills by anyone. With public feeds, people can now take advantage of feeds built by others and pin them to their home screen.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch is designed to further challenge Bluesky, which introduced the idea of custom feed building as part of its social network, a rival to X.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Bluesky has largely benefitted from an influx of people leaving X for something that looks and feels similar, it’s managed to retain its early adopters thanks to its variety of tools that allow people to make the network their own, including custom feeds. Today, those feeds are built both by the Bluesky team and other third-party developers, letting people switch between different views of the network, instead of being forced to default only to Bluesky’s algorithmic feed, “Discover.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Bluesky grew, Threads then also capitalized on user demand for more personalization, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/as-bluesky-soars-threads-rolls-out-custom-feeds-globally/\">rolling out its own version of custom feeds</a> to global users last November. The move came only days after Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/as-bluesky-surges-threads-begins-testing-custom-feeds/\">announced</a> that a test of the feature was live, signaling Meta was working quickly to topple some of Bluesky’s momentum.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To use Threads’ custom feeds, you’ll first search for a topic to see the latest posts then tap on the three-dot menu and choose “Create New Feed.” You can also customize feeds by adding specific user profiles to a given feed by tapping on the three-dot icon above a user’s profile photo and then adding them to the feed of your choice.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To now make those feeds public, you’ll tap and hold the feed and then tap “Edit Feeds.” From here, you can toggle your feed to “Public.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Threads will also let you share your public feed with others through a link or DM by tapping “View Feed” from the Edit Feeds settings where you can use the quote icon to post a preview of your custom feed. You then use the “Share Feed” button to send the custom feed out to others.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since launching, Threads users have created custom feeds around topics like sports, books, art, astronomy, fashion, poetry, design, and more. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, unlike Bluesky, Threads’ custom feeds are mainly focused on interests, whereas Bluesky’s custom feeds can either be interest-based or just different ways to sort and filter the content on Bluesky. For instance, Bluesky offers feeds that focus on what’s trending in your network, those that help you catch up on what you’ve missed, those that focus only on video, and more.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

And by then, it is often too late. This topic is personal to me, as I saw both my oldest brother and my mother suffer from illnesses and require long-term care in recent years. Not only is it difficult to find quality care, but it is also extremely expensive — even if you were fortunate enough to purchase some sort of insurance policy. So when I was recently pitched a story on a startup using AI to help people navigate long-term care planning, I was intrigued. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/29/this-bay-area-startup-is-using-ai-to-help-families-navigate-long-term-care/\">Lily Vittayarukskul started <strong>Waterlily</strong> in late 2021</a> after her family was “wiped out” financially by helping care for her aunt who had been diagnosed with terminal colon cancer. The company uses artificial intelligence to predict a family’s future long-term care needs and costs and then guides them “in building a care plan and figuring out the right way to pay for it.” </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fascinating. I’m not the only one who thinks this way. Vittayarukskul initially started Waterlily as a solo founder until Evan Ehrenberg, a small angel investor, came along. Ehrenberg — who had previously founded and <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220308006359/en/MB-Sciences-Inc-Acquires-Clara-Health-and-Announces-Goal-to-Become-a-Leader-in-Patient-Recruitment-and-Retention-in-Clinical-Trials\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">sold</a> Clara Health — helped with early research and was struck by the industry’s response. Curious, he tested the platform and was shocked by his long-term care predictions — so much so that he changed his diet, hired a personal trainer, and updated his financial plans. That experience pulled him in deeper. By 2022, Ehrenberg — who became MIT’s youngest neuroscience PhD — had joined Waterlily as a co-founder. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-dollars-and-cents\">Dollars and cents</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Moove Founders\" class=\"wp-image-2283820\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"4263\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 6428px) 100vw, 6428px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moove-Founders_Jide_Ladi.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moove-Founders_Jide_Ladi.jpg 6428w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moove-Founders_Jide_Ladi.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moove-Founders_Jide_Ladi.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moove-Founders_Jide_Ladi.jpg?resize=768,509 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moove-Founders_Jide_Ladi.jpg?resize=680,451 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moove-Founders_Jide_Ladi.jpg?resize=1200,796 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moove-Founders_Jide_Ladi.jpg?resize=1280,849 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moove-Founders_Jide_Ladi.jpg?resize=430,285 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moove-Founders_Jide_Ladi.jpg?resize=720,477 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moove-Founders_Jide_Ladi.jpg?resize=900,597 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moove-Founders_Jide_Ladi.jpg?resize=800,531 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moove-Founders_Jide_Ladi.jpg?resize=1536,1019 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moove-Founders_Jide_Ladi.jpg?resize=2048,1358 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moove-Founders_Jide_Ladi.jpg?resize=668,443 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moove-Founders_Jide_Ladi.jpg?resize=565,375 565w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moove-Founders_Jide_Ladi.jpg?resize=930,617 930w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moove-Founders_Jide_Ladi.jpg?resize=708,470 708w\" width=\"6428\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Moove</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber-backed <strong>Moove</strong>, an Africa-born mobility fintech that offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers across six continents, has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/29/uber-backed-mobility-fintech-moove-acquires-brazils-kovi-takes-arr-to-275m/\">acquired</a> <strong>Kovi</strong>, a Brazilian urban mobility provider.
