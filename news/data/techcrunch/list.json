            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">It’s sometimes said that European VC doesn’t have the firepower to compete with VCs in the U.S., which regularly raise billion-dollar+ funds these days. Perhaps further evidence of this view persists in the news that Berlin-based <a href=\"https://cherry.vc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cherry Ventures</a> has closed its latest fund at $500 million, to be split between early-stage rounds and follow-on rounds at Series B and beyond. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A statement from Cherry laid out its ambition. It wants to use this fund to help build the “first trillion dollar company in Europe.” With this, it called for the reversal of the “doom and gloom” narrative about Europe’s economy. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s great, although evidence that European startups are currently on the trillion-dollar path remains thin on the ground. Case in point, if AI plays out as the juggernaut everyone is saying that it will be, just a handful of the most-capitalised companies in the field come from this neck of the woods. Recent research estimated that some <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/european-ai-startups-raised-8-billion-in-2024/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$8 billion</a> was raised by AI companies in Europe, compared to some <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/after-openai-xai-megarounds-ai-startup-funding-hit-a-record-97-billion\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$97 billion</a> raised in the U.S. for AI startups. Yes, it’s not only about money, but as Cherry and other VCs know, that capital is a critical part of the mix.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cherry did not put a timeline on its aspirations. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the U.K., the biggest startup market in Europe, October venture capital funding for U.K. startups fell by 50% from the previous quarter, as startups secured only around $2.9 billion, according to a Dealroom and HSBC Innovation Banking <a href=\"https://dealroom.co/reports/uk-innovation-update-q3-2024\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cherry Ventures itself did not even appear in last year’s HEC-Dow Jones Venture Capital Performance <a href=\"https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/revealed-the-best-performing-venture-capital-firms-a2ae260a\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ranking</a>, with the top title being taken by Earlybird Digital East Fund. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Revolut backer <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/12/euro-vcs-welcome-baldertons-fresh-1-3b-but-grumble-about-europes-ai-misses/\">Balderton Capital</a> recently managed to raise $1.3bn for European tech start-ups, while concurring that Europe is missing out on the AI boom.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cherry’s last fund, announced in early 2022, came in at €300 million ($312 million). The VC’s portfolio includes space-tech The Exploration Company, grocery delivery startup Flink, neurosurgical microbots company Robeaute, Greyhound owner Flix SE, and logistics unicorn Forto. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LPs in the new fund include entrepreneurs Miki Kusi from Wolt; Ilkka Paananen, chief executive of Supercell; and Jochan Enghert from Flix.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cherry Ventures’ 18 exits have included CoWSwap, Ninetailed, and Homelike.</p>\n</div>",

Tech assessment platform CodeSignal, which i<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/08/codesignal-launches-a-learning-platform-with-an-ai-powered-guide/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ntroduced a learning platform for technical subjects with AI assistants last year</a>, launched soft skill courses on its platform today to practice different professional skills and work-life scenarios. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company thinks that historically, only the top brass of different organizations could afford to hire an expensive executive coach to skill up in areas of leadership and communication. Using different AI models, Codesignal has created a practice and learning stack to make the skills and knowledge of a coach available to the masses.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tigran Solyan, CEO of CodeSignal said that companies hire non-technical people in large numbers. So, it saw an opportunity to train those folks in different areas of their professional life.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With the advancement of generative AI, we saw the opportunity to unlock a whole new world of soft skills, including leadership training, sales training, and learning negotiation tactics. We believe that hands-on training is the best way to learn a skill, and that is why after introducing technical training, we are looking at this new area,” Tigran Solyan, CEO of CodeSignal, told TechCrunch over a call.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CodeSignal has launched more than 100 courses on its platform, with topics covering areas like effectively running one-on-one meetings, strategic leadership assessment, behavioral profile assessment, sales skills assessment, and improving public speaking.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users can select any of these courses or ask the AI assistant to find them and start practicing different scenarios based on the description. You can use voice to talk to the AI character in the simulation. The company has developed its own voice stack for this instead of using an off-the-shelf solution like ElevenLabs’ conversational agent platform as it thought developing the solution in-house will save costs long-term. Once your conversation is over, the AI assistant guides you gives you tips about your chat, and helps you with areas of improvement.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2960333\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"982\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1512px) 100vw, 1512px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg 1512w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=768,499 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=680,442 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=1200,779 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=1280,831 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=430,279 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=720,468 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=900,585 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=800,520 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=668,434 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=577,375 577w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=950,617 950w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=708,460 708w\" width=\"1512\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Codesignal</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Each time you ask for the help of the assistant to give you feedback, you lose an energy bar from an energy meter. Free users — which represent 90% of the chunk — get only a limited energy bar per day. Users can unlock unlimited chat with the AI assistant by paying a fee of $24.99.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When people complete practices and courses successfully, they progress in different levels of competency in that skill that is marked by developing, intermediate, advanced, and expert markers.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CodeSignal also has enterprise plans where it designs courses specific to a company using its knowledge base and cultural values. Solyan said that in customized courses, companies can also opt for the AI character to have different personalities to help professionals practice different real-life situations.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, there is a question of baking in cultural sensitivity based on location and company culture. If that’s not baked into the courses, they could create an unpleasant experience for employees.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sumit Singla, an India-based HR consultant, said that AI might suggest being assertive in some cases, but in certain locations, that could be frowned upon.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI might encourage “radical candor” in feedback, but in cultures where indirect communication is preferred, this could backfire. The tool may misinterpret humor, sarcasm, or culturally specific expressions, leading to awkward or incorrect responses in training,” Singla said. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He believes that AI could be useful to practice some skills in a low-pressure environment. However, there is a chance that the tool might not have emotional intelligence or contextual awareness in some cases.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In training, one of the things we do is called ‘reading the room.’ AI won’t be able to adjust to different personality types, work environments, or leadership styles. Soft skills development is highly personalized, and AI may not always give context-aware feedback,” Singla noted.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Solyan said that when the company works with different clients, it tries to bake in a lot of the cultural and personality context in the experiences, but he admitted that it is an iterative process. He said that CodeSignal also builds cultural templates when it starts to work in different locations and regions.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CodeSignal primarily engages with users on its website, and the company plans to launch iOS and Android apps later this year to expand its reach. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup, backed by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/codesignal-secures-50m-for-its-tech-hiring-platform/\">Menlo Ventures and Index Ventures</a>, is not the only one using AI for learning soft skills. Microsoft LinkedIn has also experimented with using AI-powered <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/03/linkedin-goes-big-on-new-ai-tools-for-learning-recruitment-marketing-and-sales-powered-by-openai/\">tools for courses in this segment</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Chinese ecommerce and fast fashion giant Shein is facing fresh scrutiny in the European Union in relation to consumer protection rules following the launch of a coordinated action by the bloc’s Consumer Protection Cooperation Network (CPCN).</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The action is being conducted with reference to the EU’s Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, Consumer Rights Directive, Unfair Contracts Terms Directive, Price Indication Directive, and e-commerce Directive — although it’s not clear what specific concerns the Network has about Shein’s marketplace. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move was announced Wednesday by the European Commission as it simultaneously presented a package of measures and reforms aimed at tackling a slew of risks attached to a surge in low value ecommerce activity in recent years.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During a press conference announcing a <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/e-commerce-communication-comprehensive-eu-toolbox-safe-and-sustainable-e-commerce\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Communication on E-Commerce</a> EU lawmakers warned that a “tsunami” of cheap imports were flooding the market with products that fail to meet the bloc’s standards — creating health and safety risks for European consumers. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unsafe products such as toys with small detachable parts that could pose a choking risk, electrical appliances with inadequate insulation, and chemicals in clothing were cited as examples of hazards linked to cheap imports. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Recent evidence and findings of tests carried out by national authorities and consumer organizations leave us in no doubt — the evidence here is clear — up to 96% of products tested and sold on these platforms are not fully compliant with our rules and our safety standards,” said rule-of-law commissioner Michael McGrath.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_410\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">EU says</a> some 4.6 billion “low-value consignments” (meaning goods with a value not exceeding €150) entered the market — equivalent to 12 million parcels per day — which is twice as many as in 2023 and 3x 2022. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The boom in ultra low cost ecommerce is also raising environmental and competition concerns in the EU. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lawmakers said the bundle of issues involved necessitates a multi-pronged approach which both seeks to make use of a full range of existing laws in relevant areas — such as the EU’s Digital Services and Digital Markets Act, its General Product Safety Regulation, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/30/eu-expands-ecodesign-rules/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ecodesign rules</a> — while also pushing for legislative reforms and additional rules in other areas, such as related to custom duties. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-safe-and-sustainable-ecommerce\">Safe and sustainable ecommerce</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Commission’s Communication sets out what’s being couched as a “A Comprehensive EU Toolbox for Safe and Sustainable E-commerce”, with the proposal spanning big ticket issues like custom reforms and targeted measures for imported goods, as well as calling for consumer protection and competition enforcement to be stepped up in this area. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">(On consumer protection, it’s worth noting that while the Commission plays a coordinating role in the CPCN, actual enforcement of laws in this area falls to Member State-level authorities — so there is only so much centralized action the EU itself can do here. Hence its loud and public call for action.)</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Communication also urges adoption of the first action plan on the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation, to help respond to environmental challenges posed by the surge in ecommerce, as well as pushing for its EU co-legislators to get behind a <a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-targeted-revision-waste-framework-directive_en\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">proposed amendment to the Waste Framework Directive</a> — which focuses on dealing with textile waste.   </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Wednesday the Commission also trailed a plan to present a “digital fairness act” — which McGrath said would aim to “reinforce consumer protection in the digital sphere in a targeted manner”. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The EU has already taken some actions in this area — sending request for information to Shein and another low cost ecommerce platform Temu <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/28/following-raft-of-consumer-complaints-shein-and-temu-face-early-eu-scrutiny-of-dsa-compliance/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">last June</a>, under the Digital Services Act (DSA), after the two platforms became subject to centralized EU oversight following their designations as very large online platforms (VLOPs). (While, also like Shein, Temu is the target of consumer protection concerns: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/15/temu-accused-of-breaching-eus-dsa-in-bundle-of-consumer-complaints/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">back in May</a> consumer groups filed a series of coordinated complaints against it, accusing it of breaching the DSA.)</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/14/aliexpress-dsa-probe/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">March 2024</a> the Commission has also had an open DSA investigation into online marketplace, AliExpress, another importer of cheap goods into the bloc. And since starting to operate the online governance framework the EU has identified ecommerce as one of its enforcement priorities — which EVP Henna Virkkunen reiterated that today.      </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We will prioritize and intensify also the Commission supervisory and enforcement of the rules applicable to online marketplaces under the Digital Services Act, including the obligation to assess the risks their service poses to consumers and the measures they take to mitigate these risks,” Virkkunen said during the press briefing. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-customs-reform\">Customs reform</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On reform of the EU’s customs union the bloc has had a proposal on the table since 2023 — which would eliminate the duty relief currently granted to packages with contents worth under €150. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During today’s briefing, Maroš Šefčovič, the Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security, said the proposal anticipated needs related to surging uptake of ecommerce and contained “critical measures” requiring online platforms to assume more responsibility as importers. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The current practice of treating citizens as importers for customs purposes is ineffective in ensuring their protection,” he warned, also stressing the need for “enhancing control capacities”. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In response to the surge of low value ecommerce imports it is critical to finalize our customs union reform and possibly front load it to 2026,” he added. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Commission is suggesting Member States get behind “possible complementary measures”, such as a non-discriminatory handling fee for goods deliver directly to consumers. Other actions it’s floating in this area include launching a “customs priority control area” dedicated to ecommerce goods; and launching coordinated actions that aim to speedily identify and remove dangerous goods such as product safety sweeps. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Šefčovič conceded the Communication represents a “call to action”, urging EU legislators and other stakeholders to “work collectively… to ensure that every citizen benefit from a trusted online marketplace”.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Responding to the Commission proposal, <a href=\"https://www.beuc.eu/press-releases/eu-e-commerce-plans-consumer-groups-call-urgent-and-ambitious-action\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">BEUC</a>, the European Consumer Organisation, pushed for “urgent and ambitious action”.  “<a href=\"https://www.beuc.eu/press-releases/gaping-holes-safety-products-sold-temu\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Consumer groups’ tests</a> show that plenty of products sold online such as toys and textiles are unsafe. If the EU is serious about protecting consumers and hitting the road to decarbonisation, it must ensure everybody plays by the same rules,” said its DG, Agustín Reyna, in a statement. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Consumer groups fully support the European Commission and national authorities launching enforcement actions, like the ongoing one we launched against <a href=\"https://www.beuc.eu/press-releases/gaping-holes-safety-products-sold-temu\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Temu</a> and the one announced today against Shein,” he added. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shein was contacted for comment on the CPCN action. Spokesman Jakub Hera Adamowicz emailed a statement in which the company wrote: “We share the CPC Network’s goal of ensuring European consumers can shop online with peace of mind, and we intend to work closely with the CPC Network and the Commission to address any concerns.”  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In wider remarks responding to the Commission’s proposed toolbox for safe and sustainable ecommerce, Shein wrote that it welcomes “efforts that enhance trust and safety for European consumers when shopping online”, and also voiced support for “a level competitive playing field”. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Shein’s on-demand model aims to reduce inefficiency and lowers waste on material and unsold inventory, allowing us to offer great style and quality at accessible prices,” it also said, adding: “Our regulatory and compliance teams across the EU will engage our partners at EU and national government-level to study these recommendations and examine how Shein can play our part in strengthening our industry to enhance the online shopping experience for European consumers.”  </p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Jen Keane’s claim to fame is that she grew a shoe using bacteria, coaxing the microbes to deposit their nanocellulosic materials in the shape of a sneaker. But she’s kind of over that.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I feel like that sort of misses the point,” she told TechCrunch. “The fiber produced by bacteria — like, that’s not a new thing.”</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s not to say her new startup doesn’t use those same fibers — it does — but it takes a different tack, one that’s more similar to the way fabric is made and used today.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Her startup, <a href=\"https://www.modernsynthesis.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Modern Synthesis</a>, still uses bacteria to grow nanocellulose fibers, but then it harvests and processes them to create a range of different materials. The new approach is more like weaving cotton into denim for jeans. Her sneaker experiment, on the other hand, was a bit like persuading a cotton plant to deposit its fibers into the shape of a pair of pants. Cool, but not as easily scalable.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Modern Synthesis’s fibers can be manipulated in ways that simple plant fibers cannot. They can be spread into a thin, wind-resistant film or textured to mimic high-quality leather, said Keane, Modern Synthesis’s CEO. In that way, they’re more like synthetic materials like polyester and polyurethane.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The difference, though, is that Modern Synthesis’s nanocellulose materials are ultimately biodegradable. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You want your materials to last a lifetime or maybe two, like 100 years. You don’t want them sticking around for thousands, which is what most of the synthetic materials will do,” Keane said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because the basic building block of the startup’s textiles is cellulose, what’s left after they’ve decomposed is similar to what’s found on a forest floor. “It should behave similarly to other cellulosic materials,” she said. “Cotton’s a great example of that.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the breakthroughs that encouraged Keane to found Modern Synthesis with Ben Reeve, the company’s chief technology officer, was the ability to create materials only using nanocellulose. Other biomaterials can mimic leather, for example, but some synthetic materials might need to be added to the mix to pull it off successfully, she said. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"A black handbag sits in front of a white backdrop.\" class=\"wp-image-2960186\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1280\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=768,492 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=680,435 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=1200,768 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=1280,819 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=430,275 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=720,461 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=900,576 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=800,512 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=1536,983 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=668,428 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=586,375 586w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=964,617 964w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=708,453 708w\" width=\"2000\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Ganni reworked its Bou Bag out of materials made by Modern Synthesis.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Modern Synthesis</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Modern Synthesis buys its nanocellulose from existing producers, which already make the stuff in large quantities for a range of applications, from <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268005X22000042\" rel=\"nofollow\">food additives</a> to <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27758719/\" rel=\"nofollow\">medical implants</a>. The startup then processes the nanocellulose to create different materials. In 2023, for example, it made an artificial leather for Danish fashion brand Ganni, which used it to make a <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2023/09/21/ganni-modern-synthesis-bou-bag-london-design-festival/\" rel=\"nofollow\">handbag</a> that contained no petrochemicals.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Keane said the company is working to quintuple production at its pilot plant. Modern Synthesis recently closed a $5.5 million funding round, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. The round was led by Extantia Capital with participation from Artesian and Collaborative Fund. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though sneakers, clothing, and handbags are likely applications for Modern Synthesis’s materials, Keane is also looking into more sci-fi uses like smart textiles with embedded electronics and more prosaic ones like car dashboards.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Cellulosic materials don’t melt like synthetics do,” she said. “If you think about car dashboards, how it starts to melt when you sit in the sun too long. Our materials won’t do that.”</p>\n</div>",

I have spent a long time on apps like MyFitnessPal, typing stuff to track my food intake. When ChatGPT came around, just like a lot of other people, I started using it for meal planning and kitchen support. However, it wasn’t personalized. So last year, after I left Whoop, I started thinking about this problem,” Alhamad said.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2960303\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Rami-Headshot.jpeg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Rami-Headshot.jpeg 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Rami-Headshot.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Rami-Headshot.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Rami-Headshot.jpeg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Rami-Headshot.jpeg?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Rami-Headshot.jpeg?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Rami-Headshot.jpeg?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Rami-Headshot.jpeg?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Rami-Headshot.jpeg?resize=531,531 531w\" width=\"720\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Alma Founder Rami Alhamad Image Credits: Alma</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alhamad, who became an entrepreneur in residence at Menlo Ventures to build Alma, believes that in the consumer space, there will be specialized companies using AI that focus on only one topic. The startup has raised $2.9 million from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/17/menlo-ventures-and-anthropic-team-up-on-a-100m-ai-fund/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Menlo Ventures and Anthropic</a> until now.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the technical front, the company is using a mix of models to get results. Alma noted that it is using knowledge from Harvard Nutrition to fetch answers. The company said it has several people on staff focusing on nutritional knowledge to expand its data set. Alhamad said that the startup also wants to look beyond the U.S. to bring health knowledge from around the world.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Alma team would like to build on food discovery in the app as well. Currently, you can ask for recipes and get answers from the AI assistant, but you can’t save them for future reference. The app wants to auto-populate food suggestions based on your goals and preferences. Plus, it will also have a way to cook food easily from what you have in the pantry.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude can already do a lot of those things, but the friction for the user is that you have to prompt them correctly with context each time. Apps like Alma are trying to take away the headache of writing long prompts through app features. Samsung’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/30/samsung-launches-a-meal-planning-and-recipe-discovery-platform-called-samsung-food/\">Food app</a> gained some features like pantry tracking and recipe suggestions <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/31/24231740/samsung-food-plus-vision-ai-food-list-management-ifa-2024\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">based on the items that you have in the house last year</a>.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shawn Carolan, a partner at Menlo VC, said that ease of entering your food intake makes Alma an attractive solution.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If I eat 20 things in a day, it’s tough to record each one of them by trying to find them in a list. With Alma, you can just talk to it and register all of that quickly. If something took you 30 seconds and a new app reduces that to just a few seconds, it becomes a key usage driver,” Carolan said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that right now, plenty of people are not consulting a nutritionist, and Alma can give them easy access to that kind of information.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People are spending thousands of dollars a month to get injections to lose weight. So the question is, if you had this perfect nutritionist in your pocket who could help you with your goal, maybe you can take a drug-free approach to achieving your health goals,” Carolan said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

But it will soon. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The<a href=\"https://www.uber.com/us/en/u/waymo-on-uber/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> “interest list,”</a> which launched Wednesday, is part of a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/13/waymo-robotaxis-will-be-on-the-uber-app-in-austin-atlanta-in-early-2025/\">partnership between Uber and Waymo</a> to operate a robotaxi service in Austin and Atlanta in early 2025. The service is expected to begin soon in Austin, although neither company would share an official start date. A new co-branded robotaxi was also revealed Wednesday.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The “Waymo on Uber” robotaxi service is the latest example of Uber’s push back into autonomous vehicles. Uber divested of its own autonomous vehicle subsidiary, known as Uber ATG, through a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/\">complex deal</a> with Aurora in December 2020. Prior to that, ironically, Uber and Waymo were arch rivals, going head-to-head in lawsuits alleging Uber stole trade secrets belonging to Waymo (which at the time was part of Google/Alphabet, which today remains a majority-shareholder) — Uber eventually <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/09/uber-settles-lawsuit-with-waymo/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">settled</a> the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/15/inside-the-uber-and-google-settlement-with-anthony-levandowski/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">suits</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber has spent the past couple of years shoring up its position in the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/06/uber-highlights-autonomous-vehicle-efforts-with-tesla-in-its-rearview-mirror/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">emerging robotaxi market</a>. The company has partnered with 14 autonomous vehicle companies that cover ride-hailing, delivery, and trucking — a handful of which are operating commercially. In December, Uber launched robotaxi rides with WeRide in Abu Dhabi and Waymo’s autonomous vehicles have been available on the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/26/waymo-driverless-vehicles-are-now-available-through-uber-starting-first-in-phoenix/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Uber app in Phoenix</a> since October 2023. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But in Austin and Atlanta, the arrangement with Waymo will be more exclusive.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the partnership, only Uber users will be able to hail Waymo’s fleet of autonomous Jaguar I-PACE vehicles. (In Phoenix, Waymo operates the fleet.) Uber will handle the charging, maintenance, and cleaning of the autonomous vehicles as well as managing access to the robotaxis via the app. Waymo will still monitor the tech and the autonomous operations, including rider assistance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Waymo robotaxis will be available to customers within 37 square miles of Austin, including downtown, Hyde Park and Montopolis. The companies said they plan to expand that territory. The Waymo robotaxi fleet will be smaller to start — although Uber would not disclose a figure — and eventually grow to hundreds of vehicles across both Austin and Atlanta over the next few years.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber said riders who are matched with a Waymo will pay the same rate as human-driven options such as UberX or Uber Comfort.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Customers who sign up for the “interest list” will receive updates from Uber and increase their chances of being matched with a Waymo autonomous vehicle at launch, according to the companies. To join, Uber customers in Austin need to update the app, then go to settings. From here, customers can click on ride preferences, where they should see a list that includes autonomous vehicles.</p>\n</div>",

GreyNoise said the flaws allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands on affected devices, leading to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or network infiltration.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The vulnerabilities were discovered by threat intelligence organization VulnCheck in July last year and reported to Zyxel the following month, according to GreyNoise, but had yet to be patched or formally disclosed by the manufacturer. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an <a href=\"https://www.zyxel.com/global/en/support/security-advisories/zyxel-security-advisory-for-command-injection-and-insecure-default-credentials-vulnerabilities-in-certain-legacy-dsl-cpe-02-04-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">advisory</a> this week, Zyxel said it “recently” became aware of the two vulnerabilities — now formally tracked as CVE-2024-40890 and CVE-2024-40891 — which it says impact multiple end-of-life products.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company claims that the flaws were not reported to it by VulnCheck and says it first became aware of them on January 29, a day after GreyNoise reported active exploitation.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zyxel, <a href=\"https://www.zyxel.com/uk/en-gb/company/about-zyxel\" rel=\"nofollow\">whose devices are used by more than 1 million businesses</a>, says that since these bugs affect “legacy products that have reached end-of-life [EOL] for years” it has no plans to release patches to fix them. Instead, the company is advising customers to replace vulnerable routers with “newer-generation products for optimal protection.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a href=\"https://vulncheck.com/blog/zyxel-telnet-vulns\" rel=\"nofollow\">a blog post on Tuesday</a>, VulnCheck notes that the impacted devices are not listed on Zyxel’s EOL page and says some of the affected models are still available for purchase through Amazon, which TechCrunch has confirmed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While these systems are older and seemingly long out of support, they remain highly relevant due to their continued use worldwide and the sustained interest from attackers,” Jacob Baines, CTO at VulnCheck, said. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a href=\"https://search.censys.io/search?resource=hosts&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;per_page=25&amp;virtual_hosts=EXCLUDE&amp;q=services.telnet.banner%3A+%7B%22VMG1312-B10A%22%2C+%22VMG1312-B10B%22%2C+%22VMG1312-B10E%22%2C+%22VMG1312-B10B%22%2C+%22VMG3312-B10A%22%2C+%22VMG3313-B10A%22%2C+%22VMG3926-B10B%22%2C+%22VMG4325-B10A%22%2C+%22VMG4380-B10A%22%2C+%22VMG8324-B10A%22%2C+%22VMG8924-B10A%22%2C+%22SBG3300%22%2C+%22SBG3500%22%7D\" rel=\"nofollow\">Censys</a>, a search engine for Internet of Things devices and Internet assets, almost 1,500 vulnerable devices remain exposed to the Internet. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an update last week, GreyNoise said that it had observed detected botnets, including Mirai, exploiting one of the Zyxel vulnerabilities, suggesting it is being used in large-scale attacks.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zyxel spokesperson Birgitte Larsen did not respond to TechCrunch’s multiple requests for comment.</p>\n</div>",

But many of them are currently growing at a rapid pace. We’re still at the beginning of the AI revolution, and though it’s easy to think about the AI industry as a zero-sum game with one country or one company “winning” over the others, it seems like the AI boom is more distributed than expected.</p>\n</div>",

In 2024 alone, AI companies represented around 20% of all VC funding in the region.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In total, that represents around $8 billion in funding for AI startups in 2024. That metric is most likely going to grow rapidly, as AI startups are still relatively young.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Hitachi Ventures secured $400 million for a fourth fund, the firm exclusively told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The size of the new fund is a vote of confidence in a range of deep tech verticals. The corporate VC’s sprawling portfolio mimics that of its limited partner’s, including energy, manufacturing, biotech, and AI.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are open to other breakthrough opportunities,” said managing director and CEO Stefan Gabriel. “There’s a lot around quantum, nuclear, life science, space tech. Not too broad — we have a clear view on what excites us in these areas.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.hitachi-ventures.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hitachi Ventures</a> will continue to focus on Series A investments. “That is still the sweet spot,” said partner Gayathri Radhakrishnan. Its first investments in a company will average around $5 million, and the fund is reserving around 55% of its capital for follow-on opportunities, partner and CFO Wolfgang Seibold said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though it takes its name from the Japanese conglomerate, Munich-based Hitachi Ventures is a bit of an outlier in the corporate VC world. It’s structured more like a typical venture fund, Gabriel said, with Hitachi serving as the solo LP. The investment committee is made up of the firm’s partners, and they do not have to run possible investments past its corporate affiliate, said Pete Bastien, partner and president of the firm’s U.S. operations. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the fund still works closely with Hitachi, he added, in part to help portfolio companies understand what a potential future customer is looking for. Like other CVCs, Hitachi Ventures doesn’t promise that it can land deals for portfolio companies, but it can make key introductions.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We can put you in front of Hitachi, but your product needs to sell itself,” Radhakrishnan said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And like other CVCs, Hitachi Ventures serves as a scout, Radhakrishnan said, scouring through pitches to find smaller companies and technologies that fits its corporate partner’s businesses.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hitachi Ventures previous investments span a range of verticals. On the energy side, it has invested in battery recycler <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/11/battery-recycling-heats-up-with-ascend-elements-542m-series-d/\">Ascend Elements</a>, fusion startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/08/thea-energy-series-a/\">Thea Energy</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/27/wase-seed-fundraise/\">Wase</a>, a wastewater-to-energy company. Its AI investments have tended toward workplace applications, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/05/ema-a-universal-ai-employee-emerges-from-stealth-with-25m/\">Ema</a>, which focuses on enterprise workflows; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/company/strikeready/\">Strikeready</a>, which covers cybersecurity; and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/makersite-lands-18m-to-help-companies-manage-product-supply-chains/\">Makersite</a>, which uses AI to improve supply chains.</p>\n</div>",
