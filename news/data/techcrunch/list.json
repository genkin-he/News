            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Google launched its much-anticipated new flagship AI model, Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental, on Wednesday. The announcement was part of a series of other AI model releases. The company is also making its “reasoning’ model, Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, available in the Gemini app.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, Google is releasing these AI models as the tech world <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/deepseek-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot-app/\">remains fixated on cheaper AI reasoning models offered by the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek</a>. DeepSeek’s models match or surpass the performance of leading AI models offered by American tech companies. At the same time, businesses can access DeepSeek’s models through the company’s API for a relative steal.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google and DeepSeek <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/19/google-releases-its-own-reasoning-ai-model/\">both released</a> AI reasoning models in December, but <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/27/deepseek-claims-its-reasoning-model-beats-openais-o1-on-certain-benchmarks/\">DeepSeek’s R1</a> got a lot more attention. Now, Google may be trying to put its Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking model in front of more eyes through its popular Gemini app.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for Gemini 2.0 Pro, the successor to the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/gemini-1-5-pro/\">Gemini 1.5 Pro model</a> Google launched last February, Google says that it is now the leading model in its Gemini AI model family. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/19/google-releases-its-own-reasoning-ai-model/\">accidentally announced</a> the Gemini 2.0 Pro model’s release in the Gemini app’s changelog roughly a week ago. But this time, it’s for real. The company is releasing an experimental version of the model on Wednesday in its AI development platforms, Vertex AI and Google AI Studio. Gemini 2.0 Pro will also be available to subscribers to Gemini Advanced in the Gemini app.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Specifically, the new Gemini Pro model excels at coding and handling complex prompts, per Google, and it comes with “better understanding and reasoning of world knowledge” than any of the company’s previous models. Gemini 2.0 Pro can call tools like Google Search, and execute code on behalf of users.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gemini 2.0 Pro’s context window is 2 million tokens, meaning it can process about 1.5 million words in one go. Expressed another way, Google’s newest AI model could ingest all seven books in the Harry Potter series in a single prompt and still have about 400,000 words left over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is also making its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/11/gemini-2-0-googles-newest-flagship-ai-can-generate-text-images-and-speech/\">Gemini 2.0 Flash model</a> generally available on Wednesday. This model was announced in December and is now available to all users of the Gemini app.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lastly, possibly to rival the excitement surrounding DeepSeek’s models, Google is introducing a new, more cost-efficient AI model, Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite. The company says this model outperforms its Gemini 1.5 Flash model, but runs at the same price and speed.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Attorneys for Elon Musk intend to move to dismiss a case that accuses the Tesla CEO, who is also the head of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/20/president-trump-signs-exec-order-to-make-musks-doge-commission-more-official/\">President Donald Trump’s DOGE organization</a>, of using AI-generated, copyright-violating “Blade Runner”-inspired images at a Tesla press event.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.945374/gov.uscourts.cacd.945374.23.0.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">In a filing</a> submitted to the U.S. District Court Central District of California, Western Division late Tuesday, attorneys for Musk said both Musk and Tesla, which is also named as a defendant in the suit, will move to dismiss “all claims” for relief with prejudice. “With prejudice” is a legal term meaning that a case is dismissed permanently, and can’t be refiled. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The plaintiff in the suit, Alcon Entertainment, intends to oppose the motion, per the filing.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In October, Alcon, the production company behind the 2017 film “Blade Runner 2049,” filed the lawsuit against Musk, Tesla, and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) for what it claimed was a willful circumvention of its IP rights. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Alcon’s complaint, Musk and WBD asked to use imagery from “Blade Runner 2049” to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/10/teslas-we-robot-event-how-to-recap-the-cybercab-robovan-reveals/\">promote Tesla’s futuristic concept cars</a> hours before their unveiling on a Warner studio lot. When Alcon wouldn’t agree to provide the rights through WBD, the suit alleges that Tesla, at Musk’s direction, sourced that imagery as raw material to duplicate it using an AI model. No specific AI model is named in the suit (yet).</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk then <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6v6dbxPlsXs?t=340\" rel=\"nofollow\">showed this allegedly fake “Blade Runner” imagery</a> during the event while talking about the film itself. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alcon also claims in its complaint that it was never made privy to any of the agreements between Tesla and WBD that would’ve been necessary before Tesla’s presser. The production company’s suit proposes banning Tesla from further distributing the disputed promotional materials, as well as unspecified damages — although the complaint also notes that infringements under the U.S. Copyright Act can be up to $150,000 per violation, and it provides a further cost estimation that is higher:</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Based on past actual brand affiliation contracts for automotive partners on BR2049 [BladeRunner 2049], Tesla likely would have had to make significant expenditures — at least in the mid-six-figures (at least $500,000) and possibly into the eight figures ($10 million or more) to obtain a BR2049 brand affiliation with Tesla and the [company’s] cybercab [robotaxi] at market value, if Alcon had even been willing to do it at all,” reads the original complaint filed by Alcon’s legal team. “The copyright infringements here facilitated allowing Tesla to save this expenditure.”<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Cherry Ventures raises a new $500M fund for early stage and beyond, but will it be enough?",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">It’s sometimes said that European VC doesn’t have the firepower to compete with VCs in the U.S., which regularly raise billion-dollar+ funds these days. Perhaps further evidence of this view persists in the news that Berlin-based <a href=\"https://cherry.vc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cherry Ventures</a> has closed its latest fund at $500 million, to be split between early-stage rounds and follow-on rounds at Series B and beyond. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A statement from Cherry laid out its ambition. It wants to use this fund to help build the “first trillion dollar company in Europe.” With this, it called for the reversal of the “doom and gloom” narrative about Europe’s economy. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s great, although evidence that European startups are currently on the trillion-dollar path remains thin on the ground. Case in point, if AI plays out as the juggernaut everyone is saying that it will be, just a handful of the most-capitalised companies in the field come from this neck of the woods. Recent research estimated that some <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/european-ai-startups-raised-8-billion-in-2024/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$8 billion</a> was raised by AI companies in Europe, compared to some <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/after-openai-xai-megarounds-ai-startup-funding-hit-a-record-97-billion\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$97 billion</a> raised in the U.S. for AI startups. Yes, it’s not only about money, but as Cherry and other VCs know, that capital is a critical part of the mix.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cherry did not put a timeline on its aspirations. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the U.K., the biggest startup market in Europe, October venture capital funding for U.K. startups fell by 50% from the previous quarter, as startups secured only around $2.9 billion, according to a Dealroom and HSBC Innovation Banking <a href=\"https://dealroom.co/reports/uk-innovation-update-q3-2024\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cherry Ventures itself did not even appear in last year’s HEC-Dow Jones Venture Capital Performance <a href=\"https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/revealed-the-best-performing-venture-capital-firms-a2ae260a\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ranking</a>, with the top title being taken by Earlybird Digital East Fund. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Revolut backer <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/12/euro-vcs-welcome-baldertons-fresh-1-3b-but-grumble-about-europes-ai-misses/\">Balderton Capital</a> recently managed to raise $1.3bn for European tech start-ups, while concurring that Europe is missing out on the AI boom.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cherry’s last fund, announced in early 2022, came in at €300 million ($312 million). The VC’s portfolio includes space-tech The Exploration Company, grocery delivery startup Flink, neurosurgical microbots company Robeaute, Greyhound owner Flix SE, and logistics unicorn Forto. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LPs in the new fund include entrepreneurs Miki Kusi from Wolt; Ilkka Paananen, chief executive of Supercell; and Jochan Enghert from Flix.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cherry Ventures’ 18 exits have included CoWSwap, Ninetailed, and Homelike.</p>\n</div>",

Using different AI models, Codesignal has created a practice and learning stack to make the skills and knowledge of a coach available to the masses.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tigran Solyan, CEO of CodeSignal said that companies hire non-technical people in large numbers. So, it saw an opportunity to train those folks in different areas of their professional life.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With the advancement of generative AI, we saw the opportunity to unlock a whole new world of soft skills, including leadership training, sales training, and learning negotiation tactics. We believe that hands-on training is the best way to learn a skill, and that is why after introducing technical training, we are looking at this new area,” Tigran Solyan, CEO of CodeSignal, told TechCrunch over a call.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CodeSignal has launched more than 100 courses on its platform, with topics covering areas like effectively running one-on-one meetings, strategic leadership assessment, behavioral profile assessment, sales skills assessment, and improving public speaking.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users can select any of these courses or ask the AI assistant to find them and start practicing different scenarios based on the description. You can use voice to talk to the AI character in the simulation. The company has developed its own voice stack for this instead of using an off-the-shelf solution like ElevenLabs’ conversational agent platform as it thought developing the solution in-house will save costs long-term. Once your conversation is over, the AI assistant guides you gives you tips about your chat, and helps you with areas of improvement.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2960333\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"982\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1512px) 100vw, 1512px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg 1512w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=768,499 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=680,442 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=1200,779 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=1280,831 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=430,279 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=720,468 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=900,585 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=800,520 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=668,434 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=577,375 577w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=950,617 950w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CodeSignal-Conversation-Simulation-Feedback.jpg?resize=708,460 708w\" width=\"1512\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Codesignal</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Each time you ask for the help of the assistant to give you feedback, you lose an energy bar from an energy meter.

Solyan said that in customized courses, companies can also opt for the AI character to have different personalities to help professionals practice different real-life situations.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, there is a question of baking in cultural sensitivity based on location and company culture. If that’s not baked into the courses, they could create an unpleasant experience for employees.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sumit Singla, an India-based HR consultant, said that AI might suggest being assertive in some cases, but in certain locations, that could be frowned upon.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI might encourage “radical candor” in feedback, but in cultures where indirect communication is preferred, this could backfire. The tool may misinterpret humor, sarcasm, or culturally specific expressions, leading to awkward or incorrect responses in training,” Singla said. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He believes that AI could be useful to practice some skills in a low-pressure environment. However, there is a chance that the tool might not have emotional intelligence or contextual awareness in some cases.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In training, one of the things we do is called ‘reading the room.’ AI won’t be able to adjust to different personality types, work environments, or leadership styles. Soft skills development is highly personalized, and AI may not always give context-aware feedback,” Singla noted.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Solyan said that when the company works with different clients, it tries to bake in a lot of the cultural and personality context in the experiences, but he admitted that it is an iterative process. He said that CodeSignal also builds cultural templates when it starts to work in different locations and regions.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CodeSignal primarily engages with users on its website, and the company plans to launch iOS and Android apps later this year to expand its reach. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup, backed by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/codesignal-secures-50m-for-its-tech-hiring-platform/\">Menlo Ventures and Index Ventures</a>, is not the only one using AI for learning soft skills.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Chinese ecommerce and fast fashion giant Shein is facing fresh scrutiny in the European Union in relation to consumer protection rules following the launch of a coordinated action by the bloc’s Consumer Protection Cooperation Network (CPCN).</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The action is being conducted with reference to the EU’s Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, Consumer Rights Directive, Unfair Contracts Terms Directive, Price Indication Directive, and e-commerce Directive — although it’s not clear what specific concerns the Network has about Shein’s marketplace. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move was announced Wednesday by the European Commission as it simultaneously presented a package of measures and reforms aimed at tackling a slew of risks attached to a surge in low value ecommerce activity in recent years.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During a press conference announcing a <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/e-commerce-communication-comprehensive-eu-toolbox-safe-and-sustainable-e-commerce\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Communication on E-Commerce</a> EU lawmakers warned that a “tsunami” of cheap imports were flooding the market with products that fail to meet the bloc’s standards — creating health and safety risks for European consumers. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unsafe products such as toys with small detachable parts that could pose a choking risk, electrical appliances with inadequate insulation, and chemicals in clothing were cited as examples of hazards linked to cheap imports. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Recent evidence and findings of tests carried out by national authorities and consumer organizations leave us in no doubt — the evidence here is clear — up to 96% of products tested and sold on these platforms are not fully compliant with our rules and our safety standards,” said rule-of-law commissioner Michael McGrath.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_410\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">EU says</a> some 4.6 billion “low-value consignments” (meaning goods with a value not exceeding €150) entered the market — equivalent to 12 million parcels per day — which is twice as many as in 2023 and 3x 2022. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The boom in ultra low cost ecommerce is also raising environmental and competition concerns in the EU. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lawmakers said the bundle of issues involved necessitates a multi-pronged approach which both seeks to make use of a full range of existing laws in relevant areas — such as the EU’s Digital Services and Digital Markets Act, its General Product Safety Regulation, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/30/eu-expands-ecodesign-rules/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ecodesign rules</a> — while also pushing for legislative reforms and additional rules in other areas, such as related to custom duties. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-safe-and-sustainable-ecommerce\">Safe and sustainable ecommerce</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Commission’s Communication sets out what’s being couched as a “A Comprehensive EU Toolbox for Safe and Sustainable E-commerce”, with the proposal spanning big ticket issues like custom reforms and targeted measures for imported goods, as well as calling for consumer protection and competition enforcement to be stepped up in this area. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">(On consumer protection, it’s worth noting that while the Commission plays a coordinating role in the CPCN, actual enforcement of laws in this area falls to Member State-level authorities — so there is only so much centralized action the EU itself can do here. Hence its loud and public call for action.)</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Communication also urges adoption of the first action plan on the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation, to help respond to environmental challenges posed by the surge in ecommerce, as well as pushing for its EU co-legislators to get behind a <a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-targeted-revision-waste-framework-directive_en\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">proposed amendment to the Waste Framework Directive</a> — which focuses on dealing with textile waste.   </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Wednesday the Commission also trailed a plan to present a “digital fairness act” — which McGrath said would aim to “reinforce consumer protection in the digital sphere in a targeted manner”. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The EU has already taken some actions in this area — sending request for information to Shein and another low cost ecommerce platform Temu <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/28/following-raft-of-consumer-complaints-shein-and-temu-face-early-eu-scrutiny-of-dsa-compliance/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">last June</a>, under the Digital Services Act (DSA), after the two platforms became subject to centralized EU oversight following their designations as very large online platforms (VLOPs). (While, also like Shein, Temu is the target of consumer protection concerns: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/15/temu-accused-of-breaching-eus-dsa-in-bundle-of-consumer-complaints/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">back in May</a> consumer groups filed a series of coordinated complaints against it, accusing it of breaching the DSA.)</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/14/aliexpress-dsa-probe/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">March 2024</a> the Commission has also had an open DSA investigation into online marketplace, AliExpress, another importer of cheap goods into the bloc. And since starting to operate the online governance framework the EU has identified ecommerce as one of its enforcement priorities — which EVP Henna Virkkunen reiterated that today.      </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We will prioritize and intensify also the Commission supervisory and enforcement of the rules applicable to online marketplaces under the Digital Services Act, including the obligation to assess the risks their service poses to consumers and the measures they take to mitigate these risks,” Virkkunen said during the press briefing. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-customs-reform\">Customs reform</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On reform of the EU’s customs union the bloc has had a proposal on the table since 2023 — which would eliminate the duty relief currently granted to packages with contents worth under €150. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During today’s briefing, Maroš Šefčovič, the Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security, said the proposal anticipated needs related to surging uptake of ecommerce and contained “critical measures” requiring online platforms to assume more responsibility as importers. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The current practice of treating citizens as importers for customs purposes is ineffective in ensuring their protection,” he warned, also stressing the need for “enhancing control capacities”. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In response to the surge of low value ecommerce imports it is critical to finalize our customs union reform and possibly front load it to 2026,” he added. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Commission is suggesting Member States get behind “possible complementary measures”, such as a non-discriminatory handling fee for goods deliver directly to consumers. Other actions it’s floating in this area include launching a “customs priority control area” dedicated to ecommerce goods; and launching coordinated actions that aim to speedily identify and remove dangerous goods such as product safety sweeps. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Šefčovič conceded the Communication represents a “call to action”, urging EU legislators and other stakeholders to “work collectively… to ensure that every citizen benefit from a trusted online marketplace”.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Responding to the Commission proposal, <a href=\"https://www.beuc.eu/press-releases/eu-e-commerce-plans-consumer-groups-call-urgent-and-ambitious-action\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">BEUC</a>, the European Consumer Organisation, pushed for “urgent and ambitious action”.  “<a href=\"https://www.beuc.eu/press-releases/gaping-holes-safety-products-sold-temu\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Consumer groups’ tests</a> show that plenty of products sold online such as toys and textiles are unsafe. If the EU is serious about protecting consumers and hitting the road to decarbonisation, it must ensure everybody plays by the same rules,” said its DG, Agustín Reyna, in a statement. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Consumer groups fully support the European Commission and national authorities launching enforcement actions, like the ongoing one we launched against <a href=\"https://www.beuc.eu/press-releases/gaping-holes-safety-products-sold-temu\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Temu</a> and the one announced today against Shein,” he added. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shein was contacted for comment on the CPCN action. Spokesman Jakub Hera Adamowicz emailed a statement in which the company wrote: “We share the CPC Network’s goal of ensuring European consumers can shop online with peace of mind, and we intend to work closely with the CPC Network and the Commission to address any concerns.”  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In wider remarks responding to the Commission’s proposed toolbox for safe and sustainable ecommerce, Shein wrote that it welcomes “efforts that enhance trust and safety for European consumers when shopping online”, and also voiced support for “a level competitive playing field”. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Shein’s on-demand model aims to reduce inefficiency and lowers waste on material and unsold inventory, allowing us to offer great style and quality at accessible prices,” it also said, adding: “Our regulatory and compliance teams across the EU will engage our partners at EU and national government-level to study these recommendations and examine how Shein can play our part in strengthening our industry to enhance the online shopping experience for European consumers.”  </p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Modern Synthesis is making compostable materials that last a lifetime",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Jen Keane’s claim to fame is that she grew a shoe using bacteria, coaxing the microbes to deposit their nanocellulosic materials in the shape of a sneaker. But she’s kind of over that.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I feel like that sort of misses the point,” she told TechCrunch. “The fiber produced by bacteria — like, that’s not a new thing.”</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s not to say her new startup doesn’t use those same fibers — it does — but it takes a different tack, one that’s more similar to the way fabric is made and used today.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Her startup, <a href=\"https://www.modernsynthesis.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Modern Synthesis</a>, still uses bacteria to grow nanocellulose fibers, but then it harvests and processes them to create a range of different materials. The new approach is more like weaving cotton into denim for jeans. Her sneaker experiment, on the other hand, was a bit like persuading a cotton plant to deposit its fibers into the shape of a pair of pants. Cool, but not as easily scalable.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Modern Synthesis’s fibers can be manipulated in ways that simple plant fibers cannot. They can be spread into a thin, wind-resistant film or textured to mimic high-quality leather, said Keane, Modern Synthesis’s CEO. In that way, they’re more like synthetic materials like polyester and polyurethane.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The difference, though, is that Modern Synthesis’s nanocellulose materials are ultimately biodegradable. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You want your materials to last a lifetime or maybe two, like 100 years. You don’t want them sticking around for thousands, which is what most of the synthetic materials will do,” Keane said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because the basic building block of the startup’s textiles is cellulose, what’s left after they’ve decomposed is similar to what’s found on a forest floor. “It should behave similarly to other cellulosic materials,” she said. “Cotton’s a great example of that.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the breakthroughs that encouraged Keane to found Modern Synthesis with Ben Reeve, the company’s chief technology officer, was the ability to create materials only using nanocellulose. Other biomaterials can mimic leather, for example, but some synthetic materials might need to be added to the mix to pull it off successfully, she said. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"A black handbag sits in front of a white backdrop.\" class=\"wp-image-2960186\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1280\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=768,492 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=680,435 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=1200,768 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=1280,819 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=430,275 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=720,461 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=900,576 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=800,512 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=1536,983 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=668,428 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=586,375 586w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=964,617 964w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modernsynthesis1.jpg?resize=708,453 708w\" width=\"2000\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Ganni reworked its Bou Bag out of materials made by Modern Synthesis.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Modern Synthesis</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Modern Synthesis buys its nanocellulose from existing producers, which already make the stuff in large quantities for a range of applications, from <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268005X22000042\" rel=\"nofollow\">food additives</a> to <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27758719/\" rel=\"nofollow\">medical implants</a>. The startup then processes the nanocellulose to create different materials. In 2023, for example, it made an artificial leather for Danish fashion brand Ganni, which used it to make a <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2023/09/21/ganni-modern-synthesis-bou-bag-london-design-festival/\" rel=\"nofollow\">handbag</a> that contained no petrochemicals.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Keane said the company is working to quintuple production at its pilot plant. Modern Synthesis recently closed a $5.5 million funding round, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. The round was led by Extantia Capital with participation from Artesian and Collaborative Fund. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though sneakers, clothing, and handbags are likely applications for Modern Synthesis’s materials, Keane is also looking into more sci-fi uses like smart textiles with embedded electronics and more prosaic ones like car dashboards.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Cellulosic materials don’t melt like synthetics do,” she said. “If you think about car dashboards, how it starts to melt when you sit in the sun too long. Our materials won’t do that.”</p>\n</div>",

You can adjust these measures after the app shows you calorie count as well.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alternatively, you can take a photo of your meal, and the AI algorithm will identify dishes for you. Such features are already available in apps like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/21/khosla-backed-healthifyme-introduces-ai-powered-image-recognition-for-indian-food/\">Kholsa-backed Healthify</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/26/snapcalorie-computer-vision-health-app-raises-3m/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">YC-backed Snapcalorie</a>. However, Alma is banking on its design, variety of input methods, and ease of use as key drivers for growth.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2960309\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"2880\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Features-FFL-Input-Types.jpeg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Features-FFL-Input-Types.jpeg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Features-FFL-Input-Types.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Features-FFL-Input-Types.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Features-FFL-Input-Types.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Features-FFL-Input-Types.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Features-FFL-Input-Types.jpeg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Features-FFL-Input-Types.jpeg?resize=1280,960 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Features-FFL-Input-Types.jpeg?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Features-FFL-Input-Types.jpeg?resize=720,540 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Features-FFL-Input-Types.jpeg?resize=900,675 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Features-FFL-Input-Types.jpeg?resize=800,600 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Features-FFL-Input-Types.jpeg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Features-FFL-Input-Types.jpeg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Features-FFL-Input-Types.jpeg?resize=668,501 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Features-FFL-Input-Types.jpeg?resize=500,375 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Features-FFL-Input-Types.jpeg?resize=823,617 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Features-FFL-Input-Types.jpeg?resize=708,531 708w\" width=\"3840\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Alma</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Besides calorie tracking, you can ask the AI assistant to suggest meals to meet your goals of fiber and protein intake.

According to him, while there are trackers for workouts and sleep, there isn’t a practical solution to tracking nutrition.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For the last 10 years of my life, I have constantly gained and lost weight. I have spent a long time on apps like MyFitnessPal, typing stuff to track my food intake. When ChatGPT came around, just like a lot of other people, I started using it for meal planning and kitchen support. However, it wasn’t personalized. So last year, after I left Whoop, I started thinking about this problem,” Alhamad said.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2960303\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Rami-Headshot.jpeg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Rami-Headshot.jpeg 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Rami-Headshot.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Rami-Headshot.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Rami-Headshot.jpeg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Rami-Headshot.jpeg?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Rami-Headshot.jpeg?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Rami-Headshot.jpeg?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Rami-Headshot.jpeg?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Rami-Headshot.jpeg?resize=531,531 531w\" width=\"720\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Alma Founder Rami Alhamad Image Credits: Alma</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alhamad, who became an entrepreneur in residence at Menlo Ventures to build Alma, believes that in the consumer space, there will be specialized companies using AI that focus on only one topic. The startup has raised $2.9 million from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/17/menlo-ventures-and-anthropic-team-up-on-a-100m-ai-fund/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Menlo Ventures and Anthropic</a> until now.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the technical front, the company is using a mix of models to get results. Alma noted that it is using knowledge from Harvard Nutrition to fetch answers. The company said it has several people on staff focusing on nutritional knowledge to expand its data set. Alhamad said that the startup also wants to look beyond the U.S. to bring health knowledge from around the world.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Alma team would like to build on food discovery in the app as well. Currently, you can ask for recipes and get answers from the AI assistant, but you can’t save them for future reference. The app wants to auto-populate food suggestions based on your goals and preferences. Plus, it will also have a way to cook food easily from what you have in the pantry.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude can already do a lot of those things, but the friction for the user is that you have to prompt them correctly with context each time. Apps like Alma are trying to take away the headache of writing long prompts through app features. Samsung’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/30/samsung-launches-a-meal-planning-and-recipe-discovery-platform-called-samsung-food/\">Food app</a> gained some features like pantry tracking and recipe suggestions <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/31/24231740/samsung-food-plus-vision-ai-food-list-management-ifa-2024\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">based on the items that you have in the house last year</a>.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shawn Carolan, a partner at Menlo VC, said that ease of entering your food intake makes Alma an attractive solution.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If I eat 20 things in a day, it’s tough to record each one of them by trying to find them in a list. With Alma, you can just talk to it and register all of that quickly. If something took you 30 seconds and a new app reduces that to just a few seconds, it becomes a key usage driver,” Carolan said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that right now, plenty of people are not consulting a nutritionist, and Alma can give them easy access to that kind of information.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People are spending thousands of dollars a month to get injections to lose weight. So the question is, if you had this perfect nutritionist in your pocket who could help you with your goal, maybe you can take a drug-free approach to achieving your health goals,” Carolan said.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Uber customers in Austin may notice a new offer when they open the app and hail a ride: an invitation to signal their interest in a Waymo robotaxi. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, this doesn’t translate into a Waymo picking them up. But it will soon. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The<a href=\"https://www.uber.com/us/en/u/waymo-on-uber/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> “interest list,”</a> which launched Wednesday, is part of a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/13/waymo-robotaxis-will-be-on-the-uber-app-in-austin-atlanta-in-early-2025/\">partnership between Uber and Waymo</a> to operate a robotaxi service in Austin and Atlanta in early 2025. The service is expected to begin soon in Austin, although neither company would share an official start date. A new co-branded robotaxi was also revealed Wednesday.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The “Waymo on Uber” robotaxi service is the latest example of Uber’s push back into autonomous vehicles. Uber divested of its own autonomous vehicle subsidiary, known as Uber ATG, through a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/\">complex deal</a> with Aurora in December 2020. Prior to that, ironically, Uber and Waymo were arch rivals, going head-to-head in lawsuits alleging Uber stole trade secrets belonging to Waymo (which at the time was part of Google/Alphabet, which today remains a majority-shareholder) — Uber eventually <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/09/uber-settles-lawsuit-with-waymo/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">settled</a> the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/15/inside-the-uber-and-google-settlement-with-anthony-levandowski/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">suits</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber has spent the past couple of years shoring up its position in the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/06/uber-highlights-autonomous-vehicle-efforts-with-tesla-in-its-rearview-mirror/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">emerging robotaxi market</a>. The company has partnered with 14 autonomous vehicle companies that cover ride-hailing, delivery, and trucking — a handful of which are operating commercially. In December, Uber launched robotaxi rides with WeRide in Abu Dhabi and Waymo’s autonomous vehicles have been available on the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/26/waymo-driverless-vehicles-are-now-available-through-uber-starting-first-in-phoenix/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Uber app in Phoenix</a> since October 2023. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But in Austin and Atlanta, the arrangement with Waymo will be more exclusive.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the partnership, only Uber users will be able to hail Waymo’s fleet of autonomous Jaguar I-PACE vehicles. (In Phoenix, Waymo operates the fleet.) Uber will handle the charging, maintenance, and cleaning of the autonomous vehicles as well as managing access to the robotaxis via the app. Waymo will still monitor the tech and the autonomous operations, including rider assistance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Waymo robotaxis will be available to customers within 37 square miles of Austin, including downtown, Hyde Park and Montopolis. The companies said they plan to expand that territory. The Waymo robotaxi fleet will be smaller to start — although Uber would not disclose a figure — and eventually grow to hundreds of vehicles across both Austin and Atlanta over the next few years.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber said riders who are matched with a Waymo will pay the same rate as human-driven options such as UberX or Uber Comfort.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Customers who sign up for the “interest list” will receive updates from Uber and increase their chances of being matched with a Waymo autonomous vehicle at launch, according to the companies. To join, Uber customers in Austin need to update the app, then go to settings. From here, customers can click on ride preferences, where they should see a list that includes autonomous vehicles.</p>\n</div>",
