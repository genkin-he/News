            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Adam Candeub, a known critic of Big Tech, looks poised to join the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Candeub will be general counsel of the FCC, <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/02/03/2025/big-tech-critic-adam-candeub-fcc\" rel=\"nofollow\">reports Semafor</a>, which cites direct confirmation from FCC chairman Brendan Carr. TechCrunch has reached out to the FCC for more information.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Candeub has long been a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/washingtonbytes/2019/06/12/to-protect-free-speech-reform-section-230-dont-put-it-into-the-usmca/#30d15246ea23\" rel=\"nofollow\">vocal critic</a> of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. Section 230 protects tech companies and online service providers from prosecution based on what their users post on their platforms. The argument against repealing Section 230 is that tech entities, including social media companies, would become liable for what is posted on their platforms, which could lead to censorship.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2020, Candeub was one of the lead writers on an <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/27/administration-fcc-trump-crackdown-383330\" rel=\"nofollow\">administrative petition</a> that asked the FCC to get involved with the ongoing debates around social media content moderation. The debates were sparked after Donald Trump accused social media sites of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/section-230-hearing-big-tech/\">censoring conservative voices</a> after companies like X — Twitter at the time — moderated his inaccurate claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That attempt to curb Section 230’s power wasn’t successful. More recent challenges have also failed. In 2023, the Supreme Court took <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/18/supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-twitter-and-google-avoiding-the-issue-of-section-230-for-now/\">Google and Twitter’s</a> respective sides in adjacent cases that tried to hold the platforms accountable for allowing content from the Islamic State that promoted the terrorist organization.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The conversation around Section 230 was already likely to come up during this administration again. Candeub joins the FCC alongside recently appointed chairman Carr, who has already <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/trumps-fcc-pick-has-said-he-wants-to-ban-tiktok-challenge-section-230/\">been vocal</a> about hoping for changes to Section 230 during this administration.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Candeub previously served as an advisor to the FCC in the early 2000s. He joined the Trump Administration in 2019 as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Telecommunications and Information and <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2020/08/12/adam-candeub-commerce-telecom\" rel=\"nofollow\">also assumed the role</a> of Acting Assistant Secretary. He joined the Department of Justice as Deputy Associate Attorney General in the waning weeks of Trump’s presidency in late 2020. Candeub is currently a law professor at Michigan State University; he first joined its law faculty back in 2004.</p>\n\n</div>",

Kinly was <a href=\"https://www.bankingdive.com/news/greenwood-acquires-neobank-kinly-killer-mike-ryan-glover-fintech/649189/\" rel=\"nofollow\">sold in 2023 to Greenwood</a>, itself a digital banking platform for Black and Latino individuals and businesses. Kinly – formerly called First Boulevard and Tenth – had raised a total of about $20 million in funding from investors such as Gabrielle Union, Marshawn Lynch, Kevin Durant, Forerunners Ventures, Point72 Ventures, Barclays, Anthemis Group. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bradley is also a limited partner in venture funds, including Cowboy Ventures and Ganas Ventures, and sits on the investment committee of the <a href=\"https://www.captablecoalition.com/investor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cap Table Coalition</a>, a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/07/these-folks-are-working-to-bring-more-diversity-to-the-venture-lp-investing-pool/\">group</a> trying to pull in investors that have been historically left out of the investing process. Richie Serna, whose day job is CEO at payments startup (and Stripe competitor) Finix, helped build CTC. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stripe <a href=\"https://stripe.com/startups/partners\" rel=\"nofollow\">operates a startup partner program</a> in which it says it works with venture capital firms and startup accelerators “to bring exclusive Stripe benefits” to portfolio companies. In recent years, it has acquired a number of startups. Most recently, it announced it was in talks <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/stripe-in-talks-to-acquire-bridge-for-1-billion/\">to acquire stablecoin platform Bridge</a> for a whopping $1 billion.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">It’s never been easier to create and publish art than it is now, and if you believe the companies building tech around AI, the production process is going to get even more efficient. That’s especially the case with video production, with companies of all sizes using large language models to build tools that let you whip up decent quality videos and animation with a few prompts and actions.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Popular tools in this space include Google’s Veo 2, OpenAI’s Sora, Runway, Luma AI, and Shanghai-based Hailuo. Now, a South Korean startup called <a href=\"https://www.cinamon.io/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Cinamon</a> is ramping up efforts to claim a part of this burgeoning market — it recently raised a $8.5 million Series B round to continue building its animated video generation platform “CINEV,” slated to be launched in beta in the first half of 2025. Altos Venture, an existing backer, as well as Saehan Venture Capital invested in this round. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cinamon’s pitch is that its platform provides a video generator that can let you build 3D environments, direct scenes and actions, place characters, edit camera angles, and more — all with text prompts and sliders. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to its CEO Doosun Hong, the company’s approach fundamentally differs from existing AI video generators, which create videos by generating pixels using text, images and videos as reference materials. In contrast, CINEV combines a 3D asset library, AI motion generation, and a filmmaking-focused large language model to first construct 3D scenes complete with characters and elements, and then lets you edit them using its suite of video production and editing tools. </p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2958425\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1472\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1714px) 100vw, 1714px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png 1714w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=150,129 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=300,258 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=768,660 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=680,584 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=1200,1031 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=1280,1099 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=430,369 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=720,618 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=900,773 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=800,687 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=1536,1319 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=668,574 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=437,375 437w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=718,617 718w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CINEV.png?resize=618,531 618w\" width=\"1714\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Some of the video generation and editing tools in CINEV. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cinamon</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Cinamon</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our approach enables easier direction and editing without consistency/physics issues, making it particularly suitable for longer-form content like films and dramas,” Hong said. “We envision CINEV to be complementary to existing AI video tools, potentially enabling new workflows where CINEV’s output could serve as high-quality reference material for other AI video platforms.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cinamon started life in 2019 as Cinamon Games, a subsidiary of content production firm Vonvon. Cinamon initially set up a JV with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/24/can-korean-digital-storytelling-platforms-captivate-north-american-and-european-audiences/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NAVER WEBTOON</a>, a Korean digital storytelling platform, to create Maybe, an interactive storytelling app. Facing growing data privacy concerns, Vonvon merged with Cinamon Games later in 2019 to focus solely on storytelling in the social content space. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While its competitors like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/16/a-quibi-like-app-called-reelshort-hit-record-downloads-and-revenue-this-month/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Crazy Maple Studio</a> started offering animated interactive story apps, fiction apps, storytelling apps and short-form videos, Cinamon instead chose to focus on creating 3D animation tools that could speed up and scale animation production for content creators and studios. Even though it cost more investment than tools for 2D content, they saw greater scalability potential.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2022, the startup began building its 3D animation platform, and later integrated AI features to enhance production efficiency. In September that year, South Korean gaming company Krafton, Naver Z (a unit of Korean internet giant Naver), and SNOW, (a camera app run by Naver), invested $10 million in Cinamon’s Series A.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Going forwards, Cinamon plans to use its investors’ IPs and 3D assets to bolster its offering. Krafton has substantial intellectual property and 3D assets used in its Battleground games, while Naver Z operates the Zepeto metaverse platform. Cinamon says CINEV can help extend these IPs beyond gaming by enabling content creators to use these IPs, and potentially drive user acquisition for Krafton and NaverZ. Cinamon also entered Nvidia’s startup accelerator, <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Inception, last August</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our potential users include comic, manga, webtoon artists, web novel writers, game developers, video creators and traditional animators looking for easier workflows,” Hong said. “In 2025, we plan to focus on customers [ranging] from individual creators to content IP companies looking for easier, faster, cheaper ways to create Anime, VTuber, and cinematic video game content.”</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cinamon plans to use the new capital for hiring more AI engineers and for R&amp;D. The startup has a team of 60 staff with expertise in 3D graphics, AI, gaming, and content production. This Series B brings its total capital raised so far to $18.5 million (25 billion KRW).</p>\n</div>",

But in a <a href=\"https://ai.meta.com/static-resource/meta-frontier-ai-framework/?utm_source=newsroom&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_content=Frontier_AI_Framework_PDF&amp;utm_campaign=Our_Approach_to_Frontier_AI_blog\" rel=\"nofollow\">new policy document</a>, Meta suggests that there are certain scenarios in which it may not release a highly capable AI system it developed internally.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The document, which Meta is calling its Frontier AI Framework, identifies two types of AI systems the company considers too risky to release: “high risk” and “critical risk” systems. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Meta defines them, both “high-risk” and “critical-risk” systems are capable of aiding in cybersecurity, chemical, and biological attacks, the difference being that “critical-risk” systems could result in a “catastrophic outcome [that] cannot be mitigated in [a] proposed deployment context.” High-risk systems, by contrast, might make an attack easier to carry out but not as reliably or dependably as a critical risk system.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Which sort of attacks are we talking about here? Meta gives a few examples, like the “automated end-to-end compromise of a best-practice-protected corporate-scale environment” and the “proliferation of high-impact biological weapons.” The list of possible catastrophes in Meta’s document is far from exhaustive, the company acknowledges, but includes those that Meta believes to be “the most urgent” and plausible to arise as a direct result of releasing a powerful AI system.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Somewhat surprising is that, according to the document, Meta classifies system risk not based on any one empirical test but informed by the input of internal and external researchers who are subject to review by “senior-level decision-makers.” Why? Meta says that it doesn’t believe the science of evaluation is “sufficiently robust as to provide definitive quantitative metrics” for deciding a system’s riskiness.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If Meta determines a system is high-risk, the company says it will limit access to the system internally and won’t release it until it implements mitigations to “reduce risk to moderate levels.” If, on the other hand, a system is deemed critical-risk, Meta says it will implement unspecified security protections to prevent the system from being exfiltrated and stop development until the system can be made less dangerous.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta’s Frontier AI Framework, which the company says will evolve with the changing AI landscape, appears to be a response to criticism of the company’s “open” approach to system development. Meta has embraced a strategy of making its AI technology openly available — albeit <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/we-finally-have-an-official-definition-for-open-source-ai/\">not open source by the commonly understood definition</a> — in contrast to companies like OpenAI that opt to gate their systems behind an API. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Meta, the open release approach has proven to be a blessing and a curse. The company’s family of AI models, called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/06/meta-unveils-a-new-more-efficient-llama-model/\">Llama</a>, has racked up hundreds of millions downloads. But Llama has also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/meta-says-its-making-its-llama-models-available-for-us-national-security-applications/\">reportedly</a> been used by at least one U.S. adversary to develop a defense chatbot. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In publishing its Frontier AI Framework, Meta may also be aiming to contrast its open AI strategy with Chinese AI firm DeepSeek’s. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/deepseek-the-countries-and-agencies-that-have-banned-the-ai-companys-tech/\">DeepSeek</a> also makes its systems openly available. But the company’s AI has few safeguards and can be easily steered to <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/01/31/harmful-and-toxic-output-deepseek-has-major-security-and-safety-gaps-study-warns\" rel=\"nofollow\">generate toxic and harmful outputs</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[W]e believe that by considering both benefits and risks in making decisions about how to develop and deploy advanced AI,” Meta writes in the document, “it is possible to deliver that technology to society in a way that preserves the benefits of that technology to society while also maintaining an appropriate level of risk.”</p>\n</div>",

The biggest worry reportedly is potential data leakage to the Chinese government. According to DeepSeek’s <a href=\"https://chat.deepseek.com/downloads/DeepSeek%E9%9A%90%E7%A7%81%E6%94%BF%E7%AD%96.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">privacy policy</a>, the company stores all user data in China, where local laws <a href=\"https://www.lawinfochina.com/display.aspx?id=23733&amp;lib=law\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">mandate</a> organizations to share data with intelligence officials upon request.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the list of regions where DeepSeek’s apps are no longer available grows, we’ll continue updating this roundup. Also included: the public sector departments that have prohibited DeepSeek tech.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-italy\">Italy</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Italy became one of the first countries to ban DeepSeek following an investigation by the country’s privacy watchdog into DeepSeek’s handling of personal data. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In late January, Italy’s Data Protection Authority (DPA) <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/29/italy-sends-first-data-watchdog-request-to-deepseek-the-data-of-millions-of-italians-is-at-risk/\">launched an investigation</a> into DeepSeek’s data collection practices and compliance with the GDPR, the EU law that governs how personal data is retained and processed in EU territories. The DPA gave DeepSeek 20 days to respond to questions about how and where the company stores user data and what it uses this data for.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DeepSeek claimed its apps didn’t call under the jurisdiction of EU law. <a href=\"https://garanteprivacy.it/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/10097450#english\" rel=\"nofollow\">Italy’s DPA disagreed</a> and took steps to remove DeepSeek’s apps from the Apple and Google app stores in Italy.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-taiwan\">Taiwan</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Taiwan’s Ministry of Digital Affairs said that DeepSeek “endangers national information security” and <a href=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/china/2025/02/03/china-taiwan-deep-seek-ban/\" rel=\"nofollow\">has banned government agencies</a> from using the company’s AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a statement, the Taiwan ministry said that public sector workers and critical infrastructure facilities run the risk of “cross-border transmission and information leakage” by using DeepSeek’s technology. The Taiwanese government’s ban applies to employees of government agencies as well as public schools and state-owned enterprises.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“DeepSeek AI service is a Chinese product,” the Ministry of Digital Affairs’ <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/taiwan-bans-government-departments-using-deepseek-ai-2025-02-03/\" rel=\"nofollow\">statement reads</a>. “Its operation involves [several] information security concerns.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-u-s-congress\">U.S. Congress</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">U.S. Congressional offices have reportedly been warned not to use DeepSeek tech.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The House’s Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), which provides support services and business solutions to the House of Representatives, sent a notice to congressional offices indicating that <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/01/30/house-congress-bans-deepseek-ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">DeepSeek’s technology is “under review,”</a> Axios reported.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[T]hreat actors are already exploiting DeepSeek to deliver malicious software and infect devices,” the notice said. “To mitigate these risks, the House has taken security measures to restrict DeepSeek’s functionality on all House-issued devices.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Axios, the CAO has prohibited staffers from installing DeepSeek applications on any official smartphones, computers, or tablets.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-texas\">Texas</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Texas Gov. Greg Abbott <a href=\"https://statescoop.com/texas-bans-deepseek-rednote-government-devices/\" rel=\"nofollow\">issued an order banning software</a> from DeepSeek and other Chinese companies from government-issued devices in the state.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a statement, Abbott said that Texas “will not allow the Chinese Communist Party to infiltrate our state’s critical infrastructure through data-harvesting AI and social media apps. Texas will continue to protect and defend our state from hostile foreign actors.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-u-s-navy\">U.S. Navy</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.S. Navy has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/us-navy-restricts-use-of-deepseek-ai-imperative-to-avoid-using.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">instructed its members not to use DeepSeek apps or technology</a>, according to CNBC.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In late January, the Navy sent an email prohibiting service members from using DeepSeek products “in any capacity” due to “potential security and ethical concerns associated with the [tech’s] origin[s] and usage.” A Navy spokesperson told CNBC the email was in reference to the Department of the Navy’s Chief Information Officer’s generative AI policy and based on an advisory from the Navy’s cyber workforce manager.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the email, the Navy said it’s “imperative” that members don’t use DeepSeek’s AI “for any work-related tasks or personal use,” and “refrain from downloading, installing, or using [DeepSeek AI].”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pentagon\">Pentagon</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pentagon has blocked access to DeepSeek technologies, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-30/pentagon-workers-used-deepseek-s-chatbot-for-days-before-block\" rel=\"nofollow\">but not before some staff accessed them</a>, Bloomberg reported.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Defense Information Systems Agency, which is responsible for the Pentagon’s IT networks, moved to ban DeepSeek’s website in January, according to Bloomberg. The decision is said to have come after defense officials raised concerns that Pentagon workers were using DeepSeek’s applications without authorization.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bloomberg notes that while the prohibition remains in place, Defense Department personnel can use DeepSeek’s AI through Ask Sage, an authorized platform that doesn’t directly connect to Chinese servers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-nasa\">NASA</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NASA has also banned employees from using DeepSeek tech. That’s according to CNBC, which obtained a memo from the agency’s chief AI officer informing personnel that <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/31/nasa-becomes-latest-federal-agency-to-block-chinas-deepseek.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">DeepSeek’s servers operate outside the U.S., raising national security concerns</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“DeepSeek and its products and services are not authorized for use with NASA’s data and information or on government-issued devices and networks,” the memo said, per CNBC. “[Employees are not authorized to] access DeepSeek via NASA devices and agency-managed network connections.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NASA has blocked use of DeepSeek apps on “agency-managed devices and networks,” CNBC reports. </p>\n</div>",

Our investigations indicate that you may have received a harmful file via WhatsApp and that the spyware may have resulted in accessing your data, including messages saved on the device.” </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have made changes to prevent this specific attack from happening again. However, your device’s operating system may remain compromised due to the spyware,” continued the message. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cancellato is the first target to come forward following the disclosure of a hacking campaign carried out using spyware allegedly made by Paragon Solutions, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/whatsapp-says-it-disrupted-a-hacking-campaign-targeting-journalists-with-spyware/\">as WhatsApp claimed on Friday</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, WhatsApp said that the spying campaign targeted around 90 people, including journalists like Cancellato and members of civil society all over the world, including in Europe. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I feel violated,” Cancellato told TechCrunch, who said that at the beginning he thought the message was a scam or a joke. “You always think somehow that a journalist might be wiretapped or spied on, but you do it more out of your own paranoia and to exorcise the fact that you may be. When someone tells you it’s true, you tend not to believe it, you always tend to think it’s something else.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, he said he realized it was real. “You ask yourself, why me? This is the thing, I mean, what did they want from me?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That’s the first question, the second question is what did they take from me? Where did they go? What did they do to me? Once they got into my phone, where there is basically my whole life, my vacations, my friendships, my family, my bank passwords, there is everything — my work stuff,” said Cancellato. “And then the third question is who did it?”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cancellato is the director of <a href=\"http://fanpage.it\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fanpage.it</a>, an Italian news website that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/fanpage-the-italian-website-that-went-from-gossip-to-award-winning-scoops\" rel=\"nofollow\">known for investigations</a> into corruption, organized crime, the Catholic Church, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/fanpage-the-italian-website-that-went-from-gossip-to-award-winning-scoops\" rel=\"nofollow\">the youth-wing</a> of the far-right ruling party in Italy, led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For that <a href=\"https://www.fanpage.it/backstair/story/gioventu-meloniana-inchiesta-su-giovani-di-fdi/\" rel=\"nofollow\">multi-part investigation</a> last year, Fanpage sent reporters undercover to infiltrate the “Gioventù Meloniana,” a group that is part of Meloni’s Fratelli d’Italia party, which has ruled Italy since 2022.

However, he said he didn’t want to speculate who was behind it. At this point, there are a lot of unanswered questions. including whether his phone was indeed hacked or targeted unsuccessfully, what the hackers were after, and who ordered the attack. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WhatsApp said that the hacking campaign was carried out by Paragon Solutions, an Israeli government spyware maker that reportedly sells a product to spy on encrypted apps, such as WhatsApp and Signal, called Graphite, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/07/29/paragon-is-an-nso-competitor-and-an-american-funded-israeli-surveillance-startup-that-hacks-encrypted-apps-like-whatsapp-and-signal/\" rel=\"nofollow\">as Forbes reported in 2021</a>. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A WhatsApp spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment asking if the company could confirm that Cancellato was a target. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/03/critic-of-italy-libya-migration-pact-told-he-was-target-of-israeli-spyware#:~:text=Paragon%20declined%20to%20comment.%20A%20person%20close%20to%20the%20company%20said%20it%20had%20about%2035%20government%20clients%2C%20which%20the%20person%20described%20as%20democratic%20governments.\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Guardian</a> quoted a person close to the company saying Paragon Solutions sold its products to 35 democratic government clients.

However, your device’s operating system may remain compromised due to the spyware,” continued the message. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cancellato is the first target to come forward following the disclosure of a hacking campaign carried out using spyware allegedly made by Paragon Solutions, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/whatsapp-says-it-disrupted-a-hacking-campaign-targeting-journalists-with-spyware/\">as WhatsApp claimed on Friday</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, WhatsApp said that the spying campaign targeted around 90 people, including journalists like Cancellato and members of civil society all over the world, including in Europe. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I feel violated,” Cancellato told TechCrunch, who said that at the beginning he thought the message was a scam or a joke. “You always think somehow that a journalist might be wiretapped or spied on, but you do it more out of your own paranoia and to exorcise the fact that you may be. When someone tells you it’s true, you tend not to believe it, you always tend to think it’s something else.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, he said he realized it was real. “You ask yourself, why me? This is the thing, I mean, what did they want from me?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That’s the first question, the second question is what did they take from me? Where did they go? What did they do to me? Once they got into my phone, where there is basically my whole life, my vacations, my friendships, my family, my bank passwords, there is everything — my work stuff,” said Cancellato. “And then the third question is who did it?”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cancellato is the director of <a href=\"http://fanpage.it\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fanpage.it</a>, an Italian news website that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/fanpage-the-italian-website-that-went-from-gossip-to-award-winning-scoops\" rel=\"nofollow\">known for investigations</a> into corruption, organized crime, the Catholic Church, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/fanpage-the-italian-website-that-went-from-gossip-to-award-winning-scoops\" rel=\"nofollow\">the youth-wing</a> of the far-right ruling party in Italy, led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For that <a href=\"https://www.fanpage.it/backstair/story/gioventu-meloniana-inchiesta-su-giovani-di-fdi/\" rel=\"nofollow\">multi-part investigation</a> last year, Fanpage sent reporters undercover to infiltrate the “Gioventù Meloniana,” a group that is part of Meloni’s Fratelli d’Italia party, which has ruled Italy since 2022. The investigation showed videos of several party members making racist remarks against Jewish and Black people, chanting N-words and Nazi slogans, and singing about the fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\"> </p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about Paragon, and this spyware campaign?

However, he said he didn’t want to speculate who was behind it. At this point, there are a lot of unanswered questions. including whether his phone was indeed hacked or targeted unsuccessfully, what the hackers were after, and who ordered the attack. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WhatsApp said that the hacking campaign was carried out by Paragon Solutions, an Israeli government spyware maker that reportedly sells a product to spy on encrypted apps, such as WhatsApp and Signal, called Graphite, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/07/29/paragon-is-an-nso-competitor-and-an-american-funded-israeli-surveillance-startup-that-hacks-encrypted-apps-like-whatsapp-and-signal/\" rel=\"nofollow\">as Forbes reported in 2021</a>. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A WhatsApp spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment asking if the company could confirm that Cancellato was a target. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/03/critic-of-italy-libya-migration-pact-told-he-was-target-of-israeli-spyware#:~:text=Paragon%20declined%20to%20comment.%20A%20person%20close%20to%20the%20company%20said%20it%20had%20about%2035%20government%20clients%2C%20which%20the%20person%20described%20as%20democratic%20governments.\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Guardian</a> quoted a person close to the company saying Paragon Solutions sold its products to 35 democratic government clients. And Israeli news outlet Ynetnews <a href=\"https://www.ynetnews.com/business/article/bkoncg0dkg#:~:text=Notably%2C%20the%20Italian%20government%20is%20a%20Paragon%20client.\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> on Monday that Italy is a Paragon customer. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Also on Monday, The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/03/critic-of-italy-libya-migration-pact-told-he-was-target-of-israeli-spyware\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> that Sweden-based Libyan activist Husam El Gomati was also notified by WhatsApp as being one of the targets of the hacking campaign. El Gomati <a href=\"https://x.com/HusamElGomati/status/1882415318514979006\" rel=\"nofollow\">has been vocal</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/HusamElGomati/status/1886444324839190754\" rel=\"nofollow\">criticizing</a> Italy’s relationship with Libya, particularly an agreement between the two countries to stop immigrants from crossing the Mediterranean.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch did not receive a response after contacting the Italian government’s press office email address, as well as to Fabrizio Alfano, the head of Meloni’s press office, via email and WhatsApp. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Paragon Solutions has cultivated a reputation for being a responsible surveillance tech vendor. <a href=\"https://paragonsolutions.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">On its official website</a>, the company says it “provides our customers with ethically based tools, teams, and insights to disrupt intractable threats.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An unnamed Paragon Solutions source <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-technology-the-trump-administration-could-use-to-hack-your-phone\" rel=\"nofollow\">told The New Yorker</a> last year that the company’s deal with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement months earlier in September was the result of a vetting process where the company allegedly showed it could prevent its technology from being used by other countries against Americans, but not the U.S. government </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Paragon Solutions <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/16/israeli-spyware-maker-paragon-bought-by-u-s-private-equity-giant/\">was acquired in December 2024</a> by American private equity giant AE Industrial Partners.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Paragon Solutions and AE Industrial did not respond to a request for comment. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WhatsApp’s message to Cancellato suggested he could contact Citizen Lab, a digital rights group at the University of Toronto that has for a decade investigated and exposed spyware abuses all over the world, including Ethiopia, Mexico, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Spain.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cancellato, who said he and Fanpage have contacted the authorities, told TechCrunch that he “did what the message asked me to do.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It is actually quite strange for a journalist to be spied on in a Western democracy,” said Cancellato, adding that the phone that was targeted was his company device, so “it’s an attack on Fanpage, it’s not an attack on me.”</p>\n</div>",
