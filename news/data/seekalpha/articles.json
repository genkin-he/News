By sector, health care and materials were the most significant detractors from market returns during the period. By country, Switzerland and France were the largest detractors while Israel and Singapore contributed to market performance.</p> <p><figure class=\"regular-img-figure\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/4/58280443-17386864001745672.png\" alt=\"Performance highlights\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2>PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE</h2> <p>The portfolio’s return was -10.93% (net) for the reporting period. This compares to the MSCI World ex USA Small Cap Index that returned -7.86% for the same period.</p> <h3>Top contributors:</h3> <ul> <li>St. James Place (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STJPF\" title=\"St. James's Place plc\">OTCPK:STJPF</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. After a strong decline from the third quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024 due to regulatory reviews that forced a management fee cut and business fine, the U.K.-headquartered wealth management company’s stock price rose strongly during the second and third quarters of 2024 as management revealed a compelling multi-year strategy to double earnings in the business by 2030. We believe management’s plan is credible based on multiple conversations with competitors, U.K. wealth management advisors and St. James Place senior executives. We continue to see the U.K. wealth management industry as an attractive and growing market and see St. James Place as competitively best positioned to capture a strong share of asset flows. Healthy asset flows combined with a reasonable cost-cutting plan should drive strong earnings growth momentum for St. James Place in the coming years. We believe the stock looks inexpensive on our view of normalized earnings.</li> <li>Julius Baer Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STJPF\" title=\"St. James's Place plc\">OTCPK:STJPF</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. The Switzerland-headquartered private bank’s price rose in November after publishing a four-month trading statement that indicated new net assets grew by 4.2%. This growth is being driven both by contributions from new hires as well as a pick-up in productivity from existing relationship managers. Gross margins also showed signs of stabilizing after declining during the first half of the year. New CEO Stefan Bollinger will join the company on January 9, which is sooner than originally expected. We view this positively and believe he is likely to launch new initiatives to both boost growth and efficiency within Julius Baer. We think the shares remain attractively priced and that financial results should improve due to efforts from the new management as well as a stabilization in the financial impact from interest rate movements.</li> <li>Strauss Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SGLJF\" title=\"Strauss Group Ltd.\">OTCPK:SGLJF</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. The Israel-headquartered food company’s stock price appreciated after reporting improved nine-month results driven by improved margins in the dairy (H&amp;W) segment and progressing recovery of profitability in the Brazil coffee business. These results are evidence that CEO Shai Babad’s transformation strategy is seeing results as the company is doing a solid job of taking cost action, improving organizational agility and pruning non-core portfolio holdings. Strauss also announced the sale of its stake in Sabra, an asset that has struggled to deliver consistent profitability owing to quality issues. The price realized from JV partner Pepsi was attractive relative to current profits as well as long-term potential in our assessment. We appreciate the company's attractive end market exposures, market share positions and self-help potential and believe the investment offers an attractive upside.</li> </ul> <h3>Top detractors:</h3> <ul> <li>SoftwareONE Holding (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SWONF\" title=\"SoftwareONE Holding AG\">OTCPK:SWONF</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The Switzerland-headquartered technology distributor’s stock price declined after the company posted weak third-quarter results, reduced both short-term and mid-term revenue guidance, and announced the appointment of a new CEO. In December, the company also announced a proposed merger with Crayon, which is another leading Microsoft reseller listed in Norway. We are working to evaluate the implications of the proposed merger and will make adjustments to our intrinsic value estimate as needed.</li> <li>Lanxess (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LNXSF\" title=\"LANXESS Aktiengesellschaft\">OTCPK:LNXSF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LNXSY\" title=\"LANXESS Aktiengesellschaft\">OTCPK:LNXSY</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The Germany-headquartered diversified chemicals company’s stock price declined despite posting nine-month earnings results that met our expectations at the group level. Lanxess’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization increased healthily, driven both by improved utilization as well as progress with its efficiency program. The primary negative in the results was the company’s free cash flow, which missed consensus expectations due to a year-over-year negative swing in working capital driven by safety stock build-up related to potential labor action at U.S. ports. While this temporarily reduced cash flow, we believe this was a prudent decision and that medium-term deleveraging will proceed in line with expectations. During the quarter, Lanxess also secured an attractive sale of its non-core Urethanes business for EUR 460 million. We think Lanxess is performing in line with our thesis and that the shares remain undervalued.</li> <li>Wynn Macau (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WYNMF\" title=\"Wynn Macau, Limited\">OTCPK:WYNMF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WYNMY\" title=\"Wynn Macau, Limited\">OTCPK:WYNMY</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The Hong Kong-listed casinos and gaming company’s stock price declined following the release of third-quarter results, which came up short of consensus but were in line with our expectations. The overall Macau gaming sector, including Wynn Macau, experienced weak share price performance in the fourth quarter due to a sequential slowdown in gross gaming revenue and negative China sentiment. However, the recovery post Covid-19 is well underway and Wynn Macau trades at historically low valuation levels. We continue to view the company as a strong operator with a solid long-term growth profile.</li> </ul> <h2>PORTFOLIO POSITIONING</h2> <p>We initiated the following position(s) during the period:</p> <ul> <li>Auction Technologies Group (ATG) is an online marketplace business that connects auctioneers to millions of bidders online in the U.S. and Europe. The company owns the leading marketplaces in its core product categories with an unmatched database of bidders. ATG provides significant value to its auction house partners by enabling them to reach a much wider bidder base than they could on their own, generating more sales and better prices. We believe the company stands to benefit from secular tailwinds that favor e-commerce penetration in auctions, driven by the beneficial economic model of online auctions compared to in-person auctions. The company is also rolling out value-added services across marketing, payments and shipping that, in our view, will increase the value of its platform in the auction ecosystem as well as allow it to increase monetization over time. Recently, a post-Covid-19 normalization in online auction sales coupled with concerns over an increase in churn of larger auction houses to white-label platforms has weighed on the share price. We believe these fears are exaggerated as headwinds from post-Covid-19 normalization will slow and the company’s core customer base of smaller auction houses is dependent on the bidders that ATG’s marketplaces can bring to bear on an auction. As such, we were happy to recently purchase shares at a material discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.</li> <li>Campari is an Italian-based global spirits producer. Its diverse portfolio includes Aperol, Campari, Espolon, Wild Turkey, Grand Marnier, and SKYY. We believe Campari is a strong marketer with a compelling portfolio that is well-positioned to benefit from the growth in cocktail culture. In our view, Campari's geographic mix limits downside and offers upside optionality in China. We also see an opportunity for improved margins and cash flows as Campari leverages decades of route-to-market investments, recent commodity headwinds normalize, and as Campari exits a period of elevated capital expenditure. Investor concerns regarding industry de-stocking and long-term demand have provided us the opportunity to purchase a highly attractive collection of assets in a defensible category with stock-specific opportunities at a 7-year low valuation.</li> <li>Sopra Steria (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPSAF\" title=\"Sopra Steria Group SA\">OTCPK:SPSAF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPPSY\" title=\"Sopra Steria Group SA\">OTCPK:SPPSY</a>) is a leading European IT services company. The IT services industry is a structurally attractive GDP+ market and an interesting way to invest in continued adoption of technology without specific technology risk. Sopra Steria is in the process of high grading its business by diversifying outside of France and by increasing its business mix towards higher-margin and higher growth digital services and consulting work. After disposing of a money-losing software business, the company has an unlevered balance sheet to pursue accretive bolt-on M&amp;A to help them in that transition. The business has a strong track record of healthy organic growth, margin expansion, and has an asset lite business model that generates strong levels of free cash flow. Recent geopolitical uncertainty in France and a post-COVID cyclical slowdown in IT spending have provided the opportunity to invest at a near-trough earnings multiple, despite the company's attractive and improving profile and robust long-term outlook.</li> </ul> <p>We eliminated the following position(s) during the period:</p> <ul> <li>Euronext (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EUXTF\" title=\"Euronext N.V.\">OTCPK:EUXTF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ERNXY\" title=\"Euronext N.V.\">OTCPK:ERNXY</a>)</li> <li>Gildan Activewear (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GIL\" title=\"Gildan Activewear Inc.\">GIL</a>)</li> </ul> <h2>OUTLOOK</h2> <p>As we look forward to 2025, we note that the spread between growth and value remains especially wide relative to history, both in US and international markets. Given this, we believe that it’s an unusually attractive time to be a value investor. This growth-led market environment has afforded us an excellent opportunity to build very well-diversified portfolios in companies trading at significantly lower than average valuations across a variety of industries. We remain optimistic about the positioning, strength and depth of opportunity set as we continue to find high-quality businesses trading at bargain prices.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p><strong>Past performance is no guarantee of future results.</strong> The investment return and principal value of this portfolio and any particular holdings may fluctuate.

By sector, health care and materials detracted the most from market returns while information technology and consumer discretionary were the top contributors. By country, Switzerland and France detracted most from market performance while the U.S. drove nearly all positive momentum.</p> <p><figure class=\"regular-img-figure\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/4/58280443-17386831772062867.png\" alt=\"Performance highlights\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2>PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE</h2> <p>The portfolio’s return was -3.87% (net) for the reporting period. This compares to the MSCI World Index that returned -0.16% for the same period.</p> <h3>Top contributors:</h3> <ul> <li>Alphabet Cl C (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. Despite ongoing litigation with the Department of Justice in its antitrust case, the U.S.- headquartered interactive media and services company’s stock price rose after posting solid third-quarter earnings. In the Search division, the company generated low-teens year-over-year revenue growth and management highlighted that they’re seeing strong user engagement with their new AI Overviews feature. The biggest upside surprise came from the Cloud division, where revenue growth accelerated to 35% and margins reached a record of 17%. This performance was driven by client demand for AI Infrastructure and Generative AI Solutions as well as core Google Cloud Platform (GCP) products. We continue to believe Alphabet is a collection of great businesses that can unlock further value over the long term through its world-class AI capabilities.</li> <li>Capital One Financial (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COF\" title=\"Capital One Financial Corporation\">COF</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. The U.S.-headquartered consumer finance company’s stock price rose after posting good third-quarter results. In our view, the update seemed to be marginally positive on all fronts, with loans and card purchase volumes growing modestly. In addition, an improved credit outlook caused management to release USD 134 million of loss reserves in the quarter, which contributed to earnings per share that exceeded consensus expectations. Furthermore, Capital One’s stock price got a significant boost in November following the U.S. presidential election as investors are optimistic that the financials sector will benefit from looser regulations. Specific to Capital One, the market now appears to believe that there is a greater probability of the merger with Discover closing and that the credit card late fee cap proposed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau seems less likely to be implemented. We appreciate management’s focus on creating long-term value and think the stock offers an attractive upside.</li> <li>Fiserv (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FI\" title=\"Fiserv, Inc.\">FI</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. The U.S.-headquartered transaction and payment processing company’s stock price rose after re- porting solid third-quarter results with reported revenue growing high single digits and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth in the high teens. Fiserv continues to leverage its scale, investment capacity and large distribution network to drive attractive growth. The business has delivered double-digit EPS growth for 38 consecutive quarters and is run by a management team we admire. We believe that Fiserv is well-positioned to benefit from the secular trend toward digital payments and banking and that the risk/reward remains skewed in our favor.</li> </ul> <h3>Top detractors:</h3> <ul> <li>Bayer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAYZF\" title=\"Bayer Aktiengesellschaft\">OTCPK:BAYZF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAYRY\" title=\"Bayer Aktiengesellschaft\">OTCPK:BAYRY</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The Germany-headquartered agriculture and pharma company’s stock price declined following developments in polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) litigation and soft preliminary 2025 guidance. In October, the Washington Supreme Court granted review for the plaintiff’s appeal of Bayer’s first win at appellate court in PCB. Bayer’s appellate win, if enforced, will result in existing cases being retried on different grounds, but the Washington Supreme Court review raises the risk that the win is overturned. We viewed the appellate win as helpful but not a skeleton key to litigation resolution, so the Washington Supreme Court development is only marginal to value. In November, Bayer issued preliminary 2025 guidance indicating that profits would likely decline. The seemingly implied decline in agriculture business profitability was particularly disappointing versus consensus. This was partially driven by temporary regulatory issues that we expect to resolve in the mid-term, and the balance was driven by challenges in the crop protection portfolio. Bayer is now kicking off a deep restructuring of crop protection that we expect to help offset pressures and drive recovery. Overall, despite current headwinds, we believe that new CEO Bill Anderson’s restructuring and organizational change initiatives will unlock improved performance at Bayer and better capitalize on the potential of its well-positioned franchises. We are watching closely for evidence of success as Bill’s strategy enters its second year.</li> <li>Centene (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CNC\" title=\"Centene Corporation\">CNC</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The U.S.-headquartered managed health care company’s stock price declined despite releasing third-quarter results that showed resilient fundamentals in the face of short-term industry pressure. Centene also issued above consensus guidance for 2025 earnings per share (EPS) at its December investor day. We believe the largest driver of the stock price decline in the quarter was investor concern around how legislative changes following the recent U.S. presidential election could impact the company. In our view, this unease is overly discounted into the share price. We see Centene as having significant embedded earnings power that can drive continued EPS growth even with a less accommodative political backdrop. Shares trade at less than 8.5x 2025 EPS guidance, which we think is a compelling valuation for a business that generates healthy returns on capital and operates in a secularly growing industry.</li> <li>IQVIA Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IQV\" title=\"IQVIA Holdings Inc.\">IQV</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The U.S.-headquartered life sciences tools and services company’s stock price declined due to a reduced near-term outlook in its R&amp;D solutions segment primarily related to a program cancellation and the delay of two large clinical trials that will resume in 2025. However, we believe that the headwinds in this part of the business should abate over the course of 2025. We are also encouraged that growth in the technology and analytics solutions segment is recovering as expected. We believe IQVIA stock is cheap at a mid-teens multiple of normal earnings power.</li> </ul> <h2>PORTFOLIO POSITIONING</h2> <p>We initiated the following position(s) during the period:</p> <ul> <li>Capgemini (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAPMF\" title=\"Capgemini SE\">OTCPK:CAPMF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CGEMY\" title=\"Capgemini SE\">OTCPK:CGEMY</a>) is a global IT services company and considered one of the strongest of the European-headquartered players due to its scale and leading digital transformation capabilities. IT services is an attractive sector that enables investment in higher growth technology adoption trends without taking vendor-specific competitive risks. With the increasing importance of technology use to drive corporate productivity, the sector grows GDP+, and the asset lite business model of IT services companies tends to deliver modest annual margin accretion with strong free cash flow conversion. IT services is also a fragmented sector where regular bolt-on acquisitions have tended to create value. The industry is currently facing cyclical demand pressure, and Capgemini also has higher levels of manufacturing sector client exposure that have been a hindrance over the past year. These headwinds will ease, driving stronger results for the business. We believe Capgemini’s current valuation does not give adequate credit to its mid-term prospects.</li> <li>Diageo (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DEO\" title=\"Diageo plc\">DEO</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DGEAF\" title=\"Diageo plc\">OTCPK:DGEAF</a>) is a global producer, distributor and marketer of premium drinks with more than 200 brands and sales in nearly 180 countries. The U.K.-based holding company's portfolio includes leading brands, such as Johnnie Walker, Guinness, Don Julio, Crown Royal, Smirnoff, Baileys, Casamigos and Captain Morgan. As the market leader, Diageo's scale provides meaningful competitive advantages in terms of distribution and marketing, which enables the company to invest more than its peers while still generating superior returns on capital. In addition, we like that the company's portfolio is well diversified by geography and category, which helps mitigate against earnings volatility related to economic cyclicality and shifting consumer preferences. Industry de-stocking and rising agave prices impacting tequila margins have weighed on the share price recently, which provided an attractive re-entry point to invest in this dominant beverage company at a below-average price.</li> <li>Elevance Health (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ELV\" title=\"Elevance Health, Inc.\">ELV</a>) is one of the nation’s largest managed care organizations. We believe managed care is an attractive industry, as health expenditures have historically outpaced GDP, and the short business cycle allows companies to quickly correct underwriting mistakes. More recently, managed care stocks have underperformed the market as the industry is facing headwinds due to mismatches between reimbursement rates and medical costs. We believe this will prove transitory and that changes to pricing and/or plan designs will help realign profit trends over time. While we acknowledge that a return to “normal” profitability will take a few years, we believe the stock is trading at a depressed multiple of depressed earnings and for a significant discount to both the broader market and the companies’ own trading history. With its unmatched scale, diversification across end markets, and track record of disciplined underwriting and capital allocation, we believe that over time, the market will once again recognize Elevance as a high-quality franchise with above average growth characteristics.</li> <li>Sysco Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SYY\" title=\"Sysco Corporation\">SYY</a>) is one of the largest foodservice distribution companies globally. We appreciate that foodservice distribution is a stable industry that has historically grown slightly faster than food spending thanks to a continued secular shift to food away from home, and that scale advantaged companies, like Sysco, benefit from better procurement terms from suppliers and demonstrate high operational efficiency. Recently, growth in Sysco’s largest and most profitable customer segment, independent restaurants, has slowed, but Sysco is increasing headcount and changing compensation incentives in its salesforce, which we think will reinvigorate growth and prove beneficial for long-term shareholders. In our view, Sysco remains a high-quality company with a credible management team, so we were happy to purchase shares at a discount to peers and Sysco’s own historical trading multiple.</li> </ul> <p>We eliminated the following position(s) during the period:</p> <ul> <li>Amazon.com (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>)</li> <li>Samsung Electronics Pfd (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF\" title=\"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\">OTCPK:SSNLF</a>)</li> </ul> <h2>OUTLOOK</h2> <p>As we look forward to 2025, we note that the spread between growth and value remains especially wide relative to history, both in US and international markets. Given this, we believe that it’s an unusually attractive time to be a value investor. This growth-led market environment has afforded us an excellent opportunity to build very well-diversified portfolios in companies trading at significantly lower than average valuations across a variety of industries. We remain optimistic about the positioning, strength and depth of opportunity set as we continue to find high-quality businesses trading at bargain prices.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p><strong>Past performance is no guarantee of future results.</strong> The investment return and principal value of this portfolio and any particular holdings may fluctuate.

After a 26.3% gain last year, the S&amp;P 500 Index returned an impressive 25.0% for an encore. The U.S. economy remains strong, with the latest GDP forecast from the Atlanta Fed estimating 3.1% GDP growth in the fourth quarter, while the rate of inflation remained below 3%. It seems that only yesterday Apple's market cap reached the <em>$1 trillion milestone</em>. As of January 2025, after a two-year blockbuster run, there were <strong>eleven</strong> companies with market values of $1 trillion or more. While Apple remained the world's most valuable company at $3.8 trillion, it was joined by <strong>NVIDIA (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>)</strong>, <strong>Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>)</strong>, <strong>Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>)</strong>, <strong>Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>)</strong>, <strong>Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>)</strong>, Tesla (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA\" title=\"Tesla, Inc.\">TSLA</a>), Berkshire Hathaway (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.A\" title=\"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\">BRK.A</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.B\" title=\"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\">BRK.B</a>), <strong>Taiwan Semiconductor (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>)</strong>, Saudi Aramco, and <strong>Broadcom</strong>. An impressive run and a notable list, indeed. Seven of these companies, collectively known as the Magnificent Seven, were again the key driver of Index returns. In 2023, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla represented 26% of the Index, on average, and accounted for 62% of its gains. In 2024, this group was responsible for 53% of the Benchmark's return, while representing approximately 31% of its weight. Our Magnificent Seven holdings outperformed the Index's by 127bps, while the rest of our portfolio outperformed the remainder of the Index's holdings by 402bps.</p> <p>Magnificent Seven performance has captured a lot of attention from the news and financial media, who spend a lot of time highlighting the group's returns but not so much emphasizing its fundamentals. As a group, Magnificent Seven total operating profits rose from $343 billion in 2022 to $575 billion in 2024<sup>4</sup>, and its free cash flow increased from $256 billion to $414 billion. During 2024, consensus estimates for 2025 earnings have increased by 21%. Now, add the fact that these companies are some of the best and most obvious beneficiaries of the AI opportunity, owning and operating key platforms enabling AI. In that context, is it really surprising that the Magnificent Seven performed as well as they did?</p> <p>From a quarterly performance attribution perspective, there was not much insight to be gleaned from what was a pretty uneventful quarter. We did well in Financials where <strong>Apollo</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APO\" title=\"Apollo Global Management, Inc.\">APO</a>) and <strong>LPL Financial</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LPLA\" title=\"LPL Financial Holdings Inc.\">LPLA</a>) generated excess returns, while our investments in Industrials and Health Care lagged. Not having investments in Materials, Utilities, and Energy also contributed to relative returns. Broadcom, Amazon, Apollo, LPL Financial, and Taiwan Semiconductor were our top five contributors to absolute returns, while <strong>Monolithic Power (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MPWR\" title=\"Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.\">MPWR</a>)</strong>, <strong>Thermo Fisher (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TMO\" title=\"Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\">TMO</a>)</strong>, and <strong>Danaher (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DHR\" title=\"Danaher Corporation\">DHR</a>)</strong> detracted.</p> <p>For the year, investments in Communication Services, Consumer Staples, Consumer Discretionary, and Financials contributed 376bps combined to relative returns, while not owning stocks in Energy, Materials, and Utilities added an additional 136bps. This was offset by poor performance in Real Estate, Information Technology, and Health Care holdings, which detracted 126bps. From a stock specific perspective, we had 29 contributors and 8 detractors - a solid batting average in what was a mixed year for our investable universe. But where we really shined was our slugging percentage with NVIDIA, Meta, Amazon, Broadcom, Taiwan Semiconductor, Apollo, Alphabet, Microsoft, and <strong>Brookfield</strong> contributing over 100bps each to absolute gains, while 13 of our holdings saw their stock prices rise over 30%. The average position size of investments that outperformed the Index was 3.6%, while the average position size of those that underperformed was 2.1% - or 150bps lower.</p> <p>The last three years proved to be quite a ride for equity investors. In many ways, it can be perceived and evaluated as a full market cycle: a sizable drawdown in 2022, followed by a meaningful recovery in 2023 and 2024. We are pleased with how the Fund performed over this combined period, generating a gain of 39.1%, close to 1,000bps better than the 29.3% return for the S&amp;P 500 Index. As a reminder, we seek to generate 100bps to 200bps of alpha over the Index (per year, net of fees and expenses, and over full-market cycles) by investing in high-quality, competitively advantaged businesses for the long term, while minimizing the probability of a permanent loss of capital. We do it differently from many of our competitors who construct their portfolios similarly to the Index by combining cheap <em>value</em> stocks with more expensive <em>growth</em> stocks. Both value and growth labels are as much a function of the multiple that is currently assigned to the stock as they are of the business's growth; they do not tell us anything about the most important characteristic of the business: its quality.</p> <p>Instead of splitting the investable universe into value stocks and growth stocks, we separate them into high-quality and lower-quality businesses. We further split the high-quality category into <em>Big Ideas</em> and companies that we call <em>holders of value</em>. Big Ideas are businesses going through the steep part of their growth s-curves that are in the earlier stages of their growth life cycles from the industry penetration perspective. These are companies that are either driving or are benefiting from disruptive change and that can become significantly larger in the future than they are today. This is the bread and butter of many investment strategies at Baron. This Fund, however, offers a home for the companies that are either in the later stages of being a Big Idea or that are transitioning into becoming holders of value (although, occasionally we may find a company priced and perceived as a holder of value that is on its way to becoming a Big Idea, as was the case with NVIDIA when we first invested in the company towards the end of 2022, and Broadcom, which was acquired early in 2024). Essentially, we focus on long-term <em>compounders with lower risk</em>: the highest quality large-cap companies with attractive business models (asset light, high recurring revenues, low financial leverage, etc.), durable growth characteristics (long duration of growth, though the growth rates may be lower), that solve critical problems for their customers and have durable competitive advantages. Typically, these companies face lower risk of getting disrupted by competitors or new technologies. We also look for management teams with long track records of operational excellence and prudent capital allocation. One of the most common signs of a company leaving the realm of a Big Idea and transitioning into the holder of value is the recognition that it can no longer reinvest all of its excess cash flow back into the business at high rates of return, and therefore it chooses to return capital back to shareholders via dividends or stock buybacks. If we are successful in identifying and investing in businesses with the above characteristics, it should make our claim and conviction in <em>lower risk of a permanent loss of capital</em> somewhat self-evident.</p> <p>We believe that the best way to assess whether we are successful in doing what we set out to do is to measure our performance over full market cycles. We believe that rolling monthly performance is helpful in that regard. This analysis shows that on an annual basis, the Fund has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index and its Morningstar peer group, 62% and 68% of the time, respectively.* But as the time horizon extends so has the Fund's winning percentage. On a 3-year rolling monthly return basis, it has outperformed 78% and 86%, and on a 5-year basis, the Fund has outperformed 96%, and 100% of the time, respectively. Note of course that past performance does not guarantee future results.</p> <p><strong>Table II - Percentage of time Fund outperformed benchmarks and peers over different time periods from inception through 12/31/2024</strong></p> <span class=\"table-responsive\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <thead><tr> <th>Rolling Return Period</th> <th>3 Months</th> <th>1 Year</th> <th>3 Years</th> <th>5 Years</th> </tr></thead> <tr> <td>Fund Outperformance vs. S&amp;P 500 Index</td> <td>61%</td> <td>62%</td> <td>78%</td> <td>96%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Fund Outperformance vs. Morningstar Large Growth Category Average*</td> <td>59%</td> <td>68%</td> <td>86%</td> <td>100%</td> </tr> </table>\n<span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span> <span class=\"table-responsive\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p>The performance data quoted represents past performance.

Shares increased 34.8% in the fourth quarter, and 72.4%<sup>5</sup> in 2024, on rising investor confidence in its AI market opportunity and strong execution across segments. Broadcom reported solid fourth quarter results, driven by robust semiconductor solutions growth of 12% with AI revenues reaching $12.2 billion for the fiscal year, although software revenues slightly missed forecasts due to deal delays. Broadcom estimated its serviceable addressable market for AI at a range of $60 billion to $90 billion by fiscal 2027, primarily across Google, Meta, and ByteDance, with additional opportunity with other customers. Moreover, the company continues to progress ahead of schedule on integrating VMware, with rapid margin expansion (reducing VMware spend to $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, down 50% from $2.4 billion prior to the acquisition) and faster-than-anticipated incremental EBITDA contribution, highlighting Broadcom's operational discipline. Non-AI semiconductor businesses showed signs of recovery, while networking solutions including Tomahawk and Jericho continue to perform well. We remain confident in Broadcom's ability to capitalize on the growth in AI infrastructure, deliver operational synergies, and maintain leadership in networking technologies.</p> <p><strong>Amazon.com</strong><strong>, Inc.</strong> is the world's largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares increased 17.7% in the fourth quarter, ending 2024 up 44.5%, after the company reported solid third quarter results, with $17.4 billion in operating profits, nearly $3 billion above consensus expectations; solid growth in Amazon's cloud business (Amazon Web Services or AWS), which grew 19% year-over-year; and continued positive commentary on AI, with Andy Jassy calling generative AI<sup>6</sup> a <em>\"once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity,\"</em> sharing promising data on growth: <em>\"our AI business is a multibillion-dollar business. It's growing triple-digit percentages year-over-year, and it's growing 3x faster at its stage of evolution than AWS did itself. We thought AWS grew pretty fast.\"</em> While the company is investing large amounts in AI, it continues to improve profitability across its core North American retail, international retail, and even AWS, thanks to cost discipline and operational optimization. While we continue to monitor progress across all cloud hyperscalers, we believe AWS will ultimately be a winner in generative AI, given Amazon's scale and technical infrastructure advantages. Longer term, Amazon has substantially more room to grow in e-commerce, where it still has less than 15% of its total addressable market. Amazon also remains the clear leader in the vast and growing cloud infrastructure market, with large opportunities in application software, including enabling generative AI workloads.</p> <p>Shares of alternative asset manager <strong>Apollo Global Management, Inc.</strong> rose 32.6% in the fourth quarter, ending the year up 73.3%<sup>7</sup>. The company held a well-received Investor Day in October, in which management highlighted the work done to build Apollo into a successful credit manager and laid out bullish five-year targets of $1.5 trillion, $5 billion, and $5 billion for assets under management, fee-related earnings, and spread-related earnings, respectively, as well as a $15-plus EPS target. Apollo also participated in the broader rally of financial stocks spurred by the Republican November elections sweep, which has bolstered expectations for greater capital markets activity and reduced regulatory scrutiny. In addition, investors anticipate that a more business-friendly administration will not block growth initiatives from alternative managers, including plans to introduce private investments into a broader swathe of retirement assets. Finally, Apollo was added to the Index in the quarter. We remain shareholders given Apollo's strong long-term growth prospects driven by the growth of alternative investments and the company's strong competitive advantages thanks to scale, first-movers advantage, and proprietary origination capabilities.</p> <h2>Top Detractors from Performance</h2> <p><strong>Table IV - Top detractors from performance for the quarter ended December 31, 2024</strong></p> <span class=\"table-responsive\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <thead><tr> <th> </th> <th>Quarter End Market Cap($ billions)</th> <td>Contribution to Return (%)</td> </tr></thead> <tr> <td>Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.</td> <td>28.9</td> <td>-0.58</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.</td> <td>199.0</td> <td>-0.44</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Danaher Corporation</td> <td>165.8</td> <td>-0.43</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation</td> <td>16.4</td> <td>-0.41</td> </tr> <tr> <td>UnitedHealth Group Incorporated</td> <td>465.5</td> <td>-0.32</td> </tr> </table>\n<span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span> <p><strong>Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.</strong> is a fabless high-performance analog and power semiconductor company serving diverse end markets across the semiconductor industry. Monolithic is a relatively small player that leverages its deep system-level and applications knowledge, strong design experience, and innovative process technologies to provide highly integrated, energy-efficient, cost-effective, and easy-to-use products. Shares fell 35.9% in the fourth quarter and finished the year down 5.6% on rumors Monolithic was being displaced as a power module supplier for NVIDIA's AI systems. While management always discussed multi-sourcing for NVIDIA's Blackwell, sell-side reports suggested Monolithic would be fully removed, which could also suggest issues with its products. After speaking with management, we believe the rumors are unlikely to materialize. As the demand environment improves, Monolithic should return to growing 10% to 15% above the industry average as it expands its addressable market and takes advantage of areas where competition fails to innovate, driving meaningful long-term upside in the stock.</p> <p><strong>Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.</strong> is a life sciences company that offers instruments and consumables for research, tools for bioproduction, specialty diagnostics, and contract research and manufacturing services. Shares fell 15.8% in the fourth quarter and ended the year down 2.1%, on underwhelming quarterly results marked by cautious commentary around China, slow progress of biopharmaceutical projects, and equipment purchases. The election of Trump and his selection of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to head Health and Human Services also pressured shares as they introduced an element of uncertainty into health care regulation and life science funding. We retain conviction as Thermo Fisher is a dominant and a diversified supplier across multiple end markets, that together with its scale, make it more resilient to a variety of market conditions. Once the macro environment normalizes, we expect a durable organic growth profile in the high single-digit range along with double-digit EPS growth.</p> <p><strong>Danaher Corporation</strong> supplies instruments to the life sciences industry for lab research, genomics services, and bioproduction and diagnostics tools for clinical tests in large core labs, hospitals, pathology labs, and at the point of care. Shares declined 17.3% in the quarter and finished 2024 down 0.5% on cautious forward-looking quarterly commentary marked by weakness in China, biopharmaceutical projects, and equipment cycles. The election of Trump and his selection of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to head Health and Human Services also pressured shares as they introduced an element of uncertainty into health care regulation and life science funding. We retain conviction given Danaher's market leadership and broad portfolio within bioprocessing, which addresses a biologics market with double-digit growth that should benefit growth thanks to a wave of biosimilars entering the market. Danaher has a portfolio of high-quality assets, with targets of high single-digit core revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth that we believe should sustain for the long term.</p> <h2>Portfolio Structure</h2> <p>The portfolio is constructed on a bottom-up basis with the quality of ideas and conviction level (rather than benchmark composition and weights) determining the size of each individual investment.

Welltower owns and operates senior housing and medical office buildings in the U.S. and internationally. Welltower owns over 2,100 properties with nearly 200,000 units and is focused on the most attractive, high end of the market, a segment in which they enjoy the benefits of geographic density, scale, and pricing power.</p> <p>We believe that senior housing fundamentals will continue to be robust with Welltower well positioned to capture both the cyclical and secular growth inflection over the coming years. The industry backdrop hasn't been this favorable in many years with accelerating demand while growth in supply is limited. Underlying demand is supported by a demographics boom with the 80+ year-old population growing at a 4% to 5% CAGR over the next five years versus annual growth below 2% coming out of the Great Financial Crisis. While growth is accelerating, supply is muted given construction starts are declining rapidly, current developer economics are no longer attractive, and there is a five-plus year timeline to entitle and build a new project.</p> <p>We believe that by returning to normalized occupancy rates, there is a path for senior housing cash flow to grow by over 50%. In addition, there is further structural upside opportunity to both operating margins and occupancy through enhanced asset management, employing proprietary data analytics and introducing initiatives such as amenity-based pricing. We recently met with the entire Welltower executive team in our offices and came away even more encouraged by the multi-dimensional growth opportunities ahead. Welltower has recruited top senior executives from the multi-family space to execute and deploy these initiatives that will drive operating margins and occupancy beyond industry standards.</p> <p>Lastly, the management team, led by Shankh Mitra (CEO), John Burkart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COO\" title=\"The Cooper Companies, Inc.\">COO</a>), Tim McHugh (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CFO\" title=\"Victory Portfolios II - VictoryShares US 500 Enhanced Volatility Wtd ETF\">CFO</a>), and Nikhil Chaudhri (CIO) are astute allocators of capital focused on driving shareholder value. Shankh's annual letters to shareholders might sound familiar to the Fund's shareholders - from defining risk as <em>\"permanent capital loss; not volatility\"</em> to reducing risk by <em>\"seeking a large margin of safety… acquiring assets for less than what it costs to build\"</em> and with the company's north star being the <em>\"long-term compounding of per share cash flow.\"</em> If you enjoy reading our letters, you will enjoy these even more - https://welltower.com/investors/.</p> <p>The current capital constrained financing environment for senior housing with loans either coming due or interest rate caps coming off assets acquired during a period of low interest rates should provide an active and growing external growth pipeline where management will be able to invest at an attractive \"cost basis\" below replacement cost. Putting this all together, we see a path for earnings to more than double over the next five years, leading to attractive return prospects for shareholders.</p> <p>During the quarter, our largest additions were to two of our recent purchases - <strong>TransDigm Group Incorporated</strong> and <strong>Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation</strong>. While commercial aftermarket growth has slowed relative to the elevated levels seen in 2022-2023, OEMs still struggle to ramp up production, and travel demand remains strong, providing durable tailwinds for TransDigm. With 90% of its portfolio classified as proprietary, the company has significant pricing power, enabling mid-single-digit growth even with inflation coming down. Additionally, the company just had one of its most active years of M&amp;A in a while and sees more opportunities ahead with the new administration's more pro-M&amp;A-stance. Booz Allen is seeing extraordinary demand from different federal agencies with its technology focused solutions. It has become the largest provider of AI and sophisticated cyber services and is at the forefront of the government's broad-based technology modernization efforts. The incoming administration's DOGE initiative is being perceived as a risk, and it has hurt both companies' share prices post the election results. While we continue to assess the range of possible outcomes, we believe the risk is both overstated and manageable. Approximately 6% of TransDigm's sales are direct to the DoD with less than 1% not under formal contracts. The company's parts are mission-critical, low cost, and purchased in low volumes. Even in scenarios in which replacement parts were to be considered, since TransDigm's parts are largely sole-sourced, it would take a while to develop, test, and certify a whole new set of solutions. More importantly, it is unlikely to yield meaningful savings and would be extremely time-consuming and risky. Booz Allen has a key set of strategic capabilities as an enabler of efficiency and technological progress with especially strong capabilities in cyber and AI.</p> <p><strong>Table VII - Top net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2024</strong></p> <span class=\"table-responsive\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <thead><tr> <th> </th> <th>Quarter End Market Cap or Market Cap When Sold($ billions)</th> <td>Net Amount Sold($ millions)</td> </tr></thead> <tr> <td>Lineage, Inc.

We continue to speak with company management teams as often as we can, test our investment thesis, look for disconfirming evidence, and measure how well our businesses are performing <em>fundamentally</em>.</p> <p>Over the long term, stock prices will reflect the intrinsic value of businesses. Of course, in any given year, stocks can trade ahead or behind because businesses' intrinsic values are not readily available to investors. Instead, they must be estimated by making assumptions and projections about growth rates, profitability, direction and level of interest rates, opportunity costs, and so on. These projections are often volatile and can swing violently in both directions depending on a multitude of factors including investors' psychology, time horizon, and risk appetite.</p> <p>To get a glimpse into the direction of intrinsic values and investor perception, we deconstructed the Fund's returns into two components - the change in multiples and change in the fundamentals. During the quarter, the Fund's weighted average multiple<sup>8</sup> declined by 0.7%, and finished 2024 up 6.4%. Since the Fund was up 3.1% in the quarter and 27.1% during 2024, <strong>the fundamentals of our holdings grew by approximately 4% in the quarter and by approximately 21% during 2024</strong> - implying that 77% of our performance in 2024 was driven by growth in fundamentals while 23% was driven by the change in multiples. The fundamentals of our businesses continue to improve after the slowdown in 2022 with consensus revenue expectations for 2025 rising by 1.1% during the quarter and 7.6% during 2024<sup>9</sup>, operating income estimates increasing by 1.7% and 10.6% respectively, and operating margin expectations increasing by 28bps in the quarter and 59bps in 2024. Business trends are improving across most sectors and geographies. A longer-term perspective on the weighted average multiple of the Fund shows that the weighted average multiple today is in line (0.1% lower) with the weighted average multiple of our holdings over the last five years.</p> <p>Every day, we live and invest in an uncertain world. Well-known conditions and widely anticipated events, such as Fed rate changes, ongoing trade disputes, government shutdowns, and the unpredictable behavior of important politicians the world over, are shrugged off by the financial markets one day and seem to drive them up or down the next. We often find it difficult to know why market participants do what they do over the short term. The constant challenges we face are real and serious, with clearly uncertain outcomes. History would suggest that most will prove passing or manageable. The business of capital allocation (or investing) is the business of taking risk, managing the uncertainty, and taking advantage of the long-term opportunities that those risks and uncertainties create. We are confident that our process is the right one, and we believe that it will enable us to make good investment decisions over time.</p> <p>Our goal is to invest in large-cap companies with, in our view, strong and durable competitive advantages, proven track records of successful capital allocation, high returns on invested capital, and high free-cash-flow generation, a significant portion of which is regularly returned to shareholders in the form of dividends or share repurchases. It is our belief that investing in great businesses at attractive valuations will enable us to earn excess risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders over the long term. We are optimistic about the prospects of the companies in which we are invested and continue to search for new ideas and investment opportunities.</p> <p><strong>Sincerely,</strong></p> <p><strong>Alex Umansky, Portfolio Manager</strong></p> <span class=\"table-responsive\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p><strong><strong>Footnotes</strong></strong></p> <p>(1)The <strong>S&amp;P 500 Index</strong> measures the performance of 500 widely held large cap U.S. companies.
