The Bank of Japan (BoJ) held its two-day policy meeting in December and announced it would hold interest rates at 0.25% despite core consumer inflation in Tokyo continuing to accelerate, which contributed to the Yen depreciating to a near 5-month low. This acceleration in inflation combined with a summary of opinions from the BoJ meeting where policymakers expressed confidence in an imminent rate increase is leading analysts to expect an interest rate hike from the BoJ in the near term. Although we are not macro experts, we retain our view that Japan has exited its multi-decade period of deflation and interest rates will normalize over the medium term.</p> <p><figure class=\"regular-img-figure\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/4/58280443-17386900830275216.png\" alt=\"Performance highlights\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2>PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE</h2> <p>The portfolio’s return was -7.75% (net) for the reporting period. This compares to the MSCI Japan Index (Net) that returned -3.60% for the same period.</p> <h3>Top contributors:</h3> <ul> <li>Sumitomo Mitsui Financial (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMFG\" title=\"Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc.\">SMFG</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMFNF\" title=\"Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc.\">OTCPK:SMFNF</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. The Japan-headquartered diversified bank’s stock price rose after second-quarter results showed a 27% increase in profit year-over-year, largely due to higher interest rates. The company also raised its annual net profit forecast to YEN 1.16 trillion. We continue to believe Sumitomo Mitsui Financial is the best run Japanese megabank with significant leverage to rising rates. The company also maintains a strong balance sheet, which adds to our confidence in this investment.</li> <li>Toyota Motor (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TM\" title=\"Toyota Motor Corporation\">TM</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TOYOF\" title=\"Toyota Motor Corporation\">OTCPK:TOYOF</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. The Japan-headquartered automobile manufacturer’s stock price rose significantly in December after announcing global production was up 6.2% year-over-year and that the return on equity (ROE) target has been nearly doubled for the 2025 fiscal year. We appreciate Toyota’s long history of quality and brand equity in the U.S. market and believe the company is one of the best-run auto companies in the world. The company benefits from industry-leading production, supply chain management, and product quality and has steadily taken market share in North America and Europe. We believe Toyota has a long runway for future growth, which can lead to further value realization.</li> <li>Recruit Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RCRRF\" title=\"Recruit Holdings Co., Ltd.\">OTCPK:RCRRF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RCRUY\" title=\"Recruit Holdings Co., Ltd.\">OTCPK:RCRUY</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. The Japan-headquartered human resources and employment services company’s stock price rose after posting a strong set of results that led to guidance being increased across all segments. Notably, there was a third straight quarter-over-quarter increase in Indeed U.S. market revenues despite a still relatively sluggish job market. The company moderately increased its midpoint of consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization after raising the low-end of the range significantly. We continue to believe Indeed is the best job site globally and that it has a long runway for growth as it captures an increasing amount of the hiring transaction process.</li> </ul> <h3>Top detractors:</h3> <ul> <li>OMRON (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OMRNY\" title=\"OMRON Corporation\">OTCPK:OMRNY</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OMRNF\" title=\"OMRON Corporation\">OTCPK:OMRNF</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The Japan-headquartered electronic components company’s stock price declined after posting second-quarter results where revenue modestly underperformed consensus expectations. Despite these results, the company continues to be a global leader in the automation field, with operations in many countries globally. We appreciate the company’s diverse product offerings, as it penetrates several markets with cutting-edge healthcare devices, social systems, and more. In our view, automation continues to grow, and Omron is well positioned to capitalize on this trend.</li> <li>Sugi (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SGIPF\" title=\"Sugi Holdings Co.,Ltd.\">OTCPK:SGIPF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SGIHY\" title=\"SUGI HLDGS CO LTD U/ADR\">OTCPK:SGIHY</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The Japan-headquartered drug retail company’s stock price declined despite reporting September earnings where total store sales grew 17.2% year-over-year. The pharmacy business was particularly strong, growing 8.9% year-over-year, and the company opened 13 new stores during the period. These positive results accelerated into October and November with over 20% year-over-year increases in same store sales during both periods. Despite temporary share price weakness, we believe Sugi will benefit from the growing role of drugstores in dispensing prescriptions. The company can become a disciplined consolidator in a fragmented industry and is in an excellent position to gain market share. We appreciate the company’s capital allocation strategy and believe the stock offers an attractive upside.</li> <li>Olympus (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OLYMY\" title=\"Olympus Corporation\">OTCPK:OLYMY</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OCPNF\" title=\"Olympus Corporation\">OTCPK:OCPNF</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The Japan-headquartered health care equipment company’s stock price declined after posting mixed second-quarter results where revenue targets were slightly missed, but operating profit exceeded consensus expectations. Despite the results, we think Olympus is a great medical business with a management team that has shown strength in selling non-core assets, organizational restructuring, and strengthening the company’s balance sheet. We believe that the company’s strong positioning in various medical segments offers an attractive long-term upside.</li> </ul> <h2>PORTFOLIO POSITIONING</h2> <p>We did not initiate any new positions during the period.</p> <p>We did not eliminate any positions during the period.</p> <h2>OUTLOOK</h2> <p>As we look forward to 2025, we note that the spread between growth and value remains especially wide relative to history, both in US and international markets. Given this, we believe that it’s an unusually attractive time to be a value investor. This growth-led market environment has afforded us an excellent opportunity to build very well-diversified portfolios in companies trading at significantly lower than average valuations across a variety of industries. We remain optimistic about the positioning, strength and depth of opportunity set as we continue to find high-quality businesses trading at bargain prices.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p><strong>Past performance is no guarantee of future results.</strong> The investment return and principal value of this portfolio and any particular holdings may fluctuate.

This compares to the MSCI World ex USA Small Cap Index that returned -7.86% for the same period.</p> <h3>Top contributors:</h3> <ul> <li>St. James Place (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STJPF\" title=\"St. James's Place plc\">OTCPK:STJPF</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. After a strong decline from the third quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024 due to regulatory reviews that forced a management fee cut and business fine, the U.K.-headquartered wealth management company’s stock price rose strongly during the second and third quarters of 2024 as management revealed a compelling multi-year strategy to double earnings in the business by 2030. We believe management’s plan is credible based on multiple conversations with competitors, U.K. wealth management advisors and St. James Place senior executives. We continue to see the U.K. wealth management industry as an attractive and growing market and see St. James Place as competitively best positioned to capture a strong share of asset flows. Healthy asset flows combined with a reasonable cost-cutting plan should drive strong earnings growth momentum for St. James Place in the coming years. We believe the stock looks inexpensive on our view of normalized earnings.</li> <li>Julius Baer Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STJPF\" title=\"St. James's Place plc\">OTCPK:STJPF</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. The Switzerland-headquartered private bank’s price rose in November after publishing a four-month trading statement that indicated new net assets grew by 4.2%. This growth is being driven both by contributions from new hires as well as a pick-up in productivity from existing relationship managers. Gross margins also showed signs of stabilizing after declining during the first half of the year. New CEO Stefan Bollinger will join the company on January 9, which is sooner than originally expected. We view this positively and believe he is likely to launch new initiatives to both boost growth and efficiency within Julius Baer. We think the shares remain attractively priced and that financial results should improve due to efforts from the new management as well as a stabilization in the financial impact from interest rate movements.</li> <li>Strauss Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SGLJF\" title=\"Strauss Group Ltd.\">OTCPK:SGLJF</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. The Israel-headquartered food company’s stock price appreciated after reporting improved nine-month results driven by improved margins in the dairy (H&amp;W) segment and progressing recovery of profitability in the Brazil coffee business. These results are evidence that CEO Shai Babad’s transformation strategy is seeing results as the company is doing a solid job of taking cost action, improving organizational agility and pruning non-core portfolio holdings. Strauss also announced the sale of its stake in Sabra, an asset that has struggled to deliver consistent profitability owing to quality issues. The price realized from JV partner Pepsi was attractive relative to current profits as well as long-term potential in our assessment. We appreciate the company's attractive end market exposures, market share positions and self-help potential and believe the investment offers an attractive upside.</li> </ul> <h3>Top detractors:</h3> <ul> <li>SoftwareONE Holding (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SWONF\" title=\"SoftwareONE Holding AG\">OTCPK:SWONF</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The Switzerland-headquartered technology distributor’s stock price declined after the company posted weak third-quarter results, reduced both short-term and mid-term revenue guidance, and announced the appointment of a new CEO. In December, the company also announced a proposed merger with Crayon, which is another leading Microsoft reseller listed in Norway. We are working to evaluate the implications of the proposed merger and will make adjustments to our intrinsic value estimate as needed.</li> <li>Lanxess (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LNXSF\" title=\"LANXESS Aktiengesellschaft\">OTCPK:LNXSF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LNXSY\" title=\"LANXESS Aktiengesellschaft\">OTCPK:LNXSY</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The Germany-headquartered diversified chemicals company’s stock price declined despite posting nine-month earnings results that met our expectations at the group level. Lanxess’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization increased healthily, driven both by improved utilization as well as progress with its efficiency program. The primary negative in the results was the company’s free cash flow, which missed consensus expectations due to a year-over-year negative swing in working capital driven by safety stock build-up related to potential labor action at U.S. ports. While this temporarily reduced cash flow, we believe this was a prudent decision and that medium-term deleveraging will proceed in line with expectations. During the quarter, Lanxess also secured an attractive sale of its non-core Urethanes business for EUR 460 million. We think Lanxess is performing in line with our thesis and that the shares remain undervalued.</li> <li>Wynn Macau (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WYNMF\" title=\"Wynn Macau, Limited\">OTCPK:WYNMF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WYNMY\" title=\"Wynn Macau, Limited\">OTCPK:WYNMY</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The Hong Kong-listed casinos and gaming company’s stock price declined following the release of third-quarter results, which came up short of consensus but were in line with our expectations. The overall Macau gaming sector, including Wynn Macau, experienced weak share price performance in the fourth quarter due to a sequential slowdown in gross gaming revenue and negative China sentiment. However, the recovery post Covid-19 is well underway and Wynn Macau trades at historically low valuation levels. We continue to view the company as a strong operator with a solid long-term growth profile.</li> </ul> <h2>PORTFOLIO POSITIONING</h2> <p>We initiated the following position(s) during the period:</p> <ul> <li>Auction Technologies Group (ATG) is an online marketplace business that connects auctioneers to millions of bidders online in the U.S. and Europe. The company owns the leading marketplaces in its core product categories with an unmatched database of bidders. ATG provides significant value to its auction house partners by enabling them to reach a much wider bidder base than they could on their own, generating more sales and better prices. We believe the company stands to benefit from secular tailwinds that favor e-commerce penetration in auctions, driven by the beneficial economic model of online auctions compared to in-person auctions. The company is also rolling out value-added services across marketing, payments and shipping that, in our view, will increase the value of its platform in the auction ecosystem as well as allow it to increase monetization over time. Recently, a post-Covid-19 normalization in online auction sales coupled with concerns over an increase in churn of larger auction houses to white-label platforms has weighed on the share price. We believe these fears are exaggerated as headwinds from post-Covid-19 normalization will slow and the company’s core customer base of smaller auction houses is dependent on the bidders that ATG’s marketplaces can bring to bear on an auction. As such, we were happy to recently purchase shares at a material discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.</li> <li>Campari is an Italian-based global spirits producer. Its diverse portfolio includes Aperol, Campari, Espolon, Wild Turkey, Grand Marnier, and SKYY. We believe Campari is a strong marketer with a compelling portfolio that is well-positioned to benefit from the growth in cocktail culture. In our view, Campari's geographic mix limits downside and offers upside optionality in China. We also see an opportunity for improved margins and cash flows as Campari leverages decades of route-to-market investments, recent commodity headwinds normalize, and as Campari exits a period of elevated capital expenditure. Investor concerns regarding industry de-stocking and long-term demand have provided us the opportunity to purchase a highly attractive collection of assets in a defensible category with stock-specific opportunities at a 7-year low valuation.</li> <li>Sopra Steria (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPSAF\" title=\"Sopra Steria Group SA\">OTCPK:SPSAF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPPSY\" title=\"Sopra Steria Group SA\">OTCPK:SPPSY</a>) is a leading European IT services company. The IT services industry is a structurally attractive GDP+ market and an interesting way to invest in continued adoption of technology without specific technology risk. Sopra Steria is in the process of high grading its business by diversifying outside of France and by increasing its business mix towards higher-margin and higher growth digital services and consulting work. After disposing of a money-losing software business, the company has an unlevered balance sheet to pursue accretive bolt-on M&amp;A to help them in that transition. The business has a strong track record of healthy organic growth, margin expansion, and has an asset lite business model that generates strong levels of free cash flow.

We remain optimistic about the positioning, strength and depth of opportunity set as we continue to find high-quality businesses trading at bargain prices.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p><strong>Past performance is no guarantee of future results.</strong> The investment return and principal value of this portfolio and any particular holdings may fluctuate.
