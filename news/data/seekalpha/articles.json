For copper miners, this resulted in a mixed performance, with the Global X Copper Miners ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COPX\" title=\"Global X Copper Miners ETF\">COPX</a>), up 3.6% in 2024. This, however, hides the large variations in performance between miners. One company that underperformed the index was ERO Copper (NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ERO#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\" title=\"Ero Copper Corp.\">ERO</a>), a copper-gold producer with three operational mines in Brazil, whose shares fell 14.6% in 2024.

Imetelstat, now known as Rytelo, has had a very strong launch, with Q3 revenues hitting $28.2mn, $9.2mn or nearly 50% above certain analyst estimates of $19mn. They are running a phase 3 trial called IMpactMF in r/r MF. This <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04576156\" rel=\"nofollow\">pivotal</a> trial started in April 2021 and has an estimated primary completion date of November 2026.

Revenue is growing fast, margins are getting better, and the company just posted its first positive operating income. The stock isn’t cheap but when you look at where Toast is headed it’s worth the premium. Currently, the market is hesitating. Some investors think it’s overpriced. Others worry about the restaurant industry slowing down. But I see this as an opportunity. Toast is winning customers at a rapid pace and its payments and software business is expanding. Wall Street isn’t giving enough credit for how big this can get. That’s why I believe there’s at least a 50% upside in the next year or so.</span></p></blockquote> <h2><span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4754334-deepseek-should-really-be-called-shallowseek-nvidia-remains-a-buy\">DeepSeek Should Really Be Called ShallowSeek -- Nvidia Remains A 'Buy'</a></span></h2> <blockquote class=\"quote\"><p><span>If DeepSeek is all they say, bears argue cost conscious firms will follow DeepSeek’s lead.

I <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4696085-nvidia-valuation-models-dont-work-as-it-doesnt-make-widgets-technical-analysis\">wrote about NVDA</a> on 5/28/24.

In addition to the companies for which I provided predictions, two other companies announced annual increases at the end of January: medical diagnostic company Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DGX\" title=\"Quest Diagnostics Incorporated\">DGX</a>) announced a 6.7% increase to an annualized $3.20 for its 15th year of dividend growth. Quest Diagnostics now has a forward yield of 1.96%. And electric utility Eversource Energy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ES\" title=\"Eversource Energy\">ES</a>) extended its dividend growth streak to 27 years with a 5.2% increase to $3.01 per year, giving the company a forward yield of 5.22%.</span></p></blockquote> <h2><span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4753106-5-relatively-secure-and-cheap-dividend-stocks-yields-upto-8-percent-february-2025\">5 Relatively Secure And Cheap Dividend Stocks, Yields Upto 8% (February 2025)</a></span></h2> <blockquote class=\"quote\"><p><span>First, surely the market is just plain expensive and needs time to absorb the recent advances. This was reminded when a number of high-flying technology and AI-related stocks nosedived this Monday (27<sup>th</sup>) due to a panic reaction to China-based <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4398835-deepseek-ai-stock-price-china\">DeepSeek's</a> announcement of much cheaper AI-language models (similar to ChatGPT). Though it is yet to be proved beyond doubt that DeepSeek's models indeed cost a fraction and are more efficient, the battle for supremacy will now be ongoing. But, you may have noticed that most blue-chip dividend-paying stocks barely budged during the tech rout; in fact, many of them gained.</span></p></blockquote> <h2><span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4753871-canadian-natural-resources-definition-shareholder-friendly-management\">Canadian Natural Resources: The Definition Of Shareholder Friendly Management</a></span></h2> <blockquote class=\"quote\"><p><span>Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CNQ#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\" title=\"Canadian Natural Resources Limited\">CNQ</a>) develops and produces a mix of fossil fuels including multiple categories of crude oil, thermal oil, and natural gas. Headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, CNQ primarily operates in Western Canada but does have some international operations in the United Kingdom and Africa. CNQ is by far the largest fossil fuel producer in Canada by any measure, and is well diversified across multiple types of energy so that they are not too exposed to a price change for any one of their products.</span></p></blockquote> <h2><span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4754398-if-i-could-only-retire-with-2-funds\">If I Could Only Retire With 2 Funds</a></span></h2> <blockquote class=\"quote\"><p><span>Retiring with dividends requires a few fundamental qualities in a portfolio. The most important is that the dividend income comfortably exceeds living expenses. This is because, firstly, to retire on dividends, you need to have sufficient dividends to pay for your living expenses. Second of all, you need a cushion because there are numerous unpredictable forces that could have a negative impact on the ability of your dividends to cover your living expenses in the future. These include inflation eroding the purchasing power of your dividends, black swan events, and sharp economic downturns that could cause dividend cuts to your portfolio. Also, unforeseen expenses could come up, such as emergency health expenditures or those following a natural disaster or something else.</span></p></blockquote> <h2><span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4754242-preferreds-weekly-review-b-riley-suspends-dividends\">Preferreds Weekly Review: B. Riley Suspends Dividends</a></span></h2> <blockquote class=\"quote\"><p><span>B. Riley suspended their preferreds dividends, impacting (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RILYL\" title=\"B. Riley Financial, Inc. 7.375 DP CUM B\">RILYL</a>) and (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RILYP\" title=\"B. Riley Financial, Inc. 6.875 DP SH PF A\">RILYP</a>). The shares were down 30-40% in the week and are trading at around $5.3. The dividends are cumulative and will continue to accrue. The company's longest baby bond (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RILYZ\" title=\"B. Riley Financial, Inc. CAL NT 28\">RILYZ</a>) is trading at $8.95. The Feb-2025 bond is trading right around par with accrued, so the market views the repayment as certain. There is $145m of the bond outstanding.</span></p></blockquote> <h2> </h2> <h2> </h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder\"></div><p><strong>Seeking Alpha's Disclosure</strong></p> <div><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-a72babe5-7fff-2fa6-0263-0176e5ac280f\"> <span>Past performance does not guarantee future results.
