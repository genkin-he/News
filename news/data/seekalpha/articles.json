Thank you so much for tuning in today's webinar all about the small-cap area focus, trying to find those names that are the hungry growing revenue EPS empires to hopefully add to your portfolio before making jumps to become mid-cap or big-cap, right, or large-cap, excuse me.</p> <p>So before we dive into the conversation today with our very own VP of Quantitative Strategy, Steven Cress, let's go ahead and get a quick legal disclaimer out of the way.</p> <p>We are not advising you personally concerning the nature, potential, value, or suitability of any particular security.

Why don't you give us a little quick recap for the people that may not know who you are?</p> <p><strong>Steven Cress</strong>: Yeah. And Daniel, thanks for organizing this and thank you for going through that disclaimer. I feel like it gets longer and longer every time you read it. But a little bit about myself, Daniel. I've been in the world of finance for over 35 years. The bulk of my career was spent at Morgan Stanley, where I ran a proprietary trading desk in quantitative strategies. I also worked at Northern Trust Asset Management. I was the Founder of a hedge fund, Cress Capital Management. And I also founded a fintech company that was purchased by Seeking Alpha about six years ago. And that fintech company focused on the most part, a real virtual analyst type of system, where you could literally put in any ticker symbol and come up with a directional recommendation. But behind it is the Quant system that you now see on Seeking Alpha today. So a little bit about my history there, Daniel. It's been a great ride.</p> <p>I'd like to sort of go over what we're going to cover in our presentation today. We're going to go into why Quant and the reason that we use it and really believe in a data-driven process, can't really comment now on the markets without going over the tariff turbulence and what's going on.</p> <p>We'll also look at Quant Factor Grades and how they work. I'll try to minimize that because I know most people are here today because they want to find out our list for our Top 10 Stocks for 2025. And again, that's small-cap stocks for 2025. We actually came out with our Top 10 Stocks a couple of weeks ago, and they are off to a stellar start.</p> <p>So I don't know if you were privy to that webinar. There's also an article that was out on the Top 10 Stocks. I'd highly recommend that you look at that. But this could be the year of the small-cap. So I'm really pleased to be participating in this webinar today with Daniel. So without further ado, we'll go quickly into what is Quant and how we achieve our results.</p> <p>So for us, with Quant, there could be a number of different strategies. Sometimes there are Value-oriented quantitative models, Momentum quantitative models, Growth quantitative models. The particular model that we like is more along the lines of a GARP model, which is growth at a reasonable price.</p> <p>So we like to have a diversified approach. I've been using this basically since the year 2000. And you'll see the models that we backtested at Seeking Alpha go back to 2010. And we employ the strategy of growth at a reasonable price, but we have a couple of other metrics that we have in there as well. We look for companies that have strong upward revisions by analysts, and we also look for stocks that have good Momentum, and we combine it all together.</p> <p>So for us, that really, when we comb through stocks, we want to make sure stocks have strong fundamentals. And we look for companies that are collectively strong in terms of their characteristics of the Valuation framework, their Growth, their Profitability, and as I mentioned, we also like Momentum and EPS Revisions for Strong Buys that are being moved upwards by analysts.</p> <p>So when we take our strategy and we combine it with the fundamental factors that we look at, we use a very, very powerful computer model to process all this information. And it gives us the ability, in essence, every single day to run fresh screens with fresh daily recommendations. And those – that process incorporates going through each stock's balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statements, and hundreds of financial metrics.</p> <p>And because of powerful computer processing, we have the ability to sort the strongest companies from the weakest companies. And we actually rank them out of all the stocks that we cover in our universe, but we also do it on a sector basis. And the sector basis is really important because when we look to identify companies, we'll look at those metrics. And for each company, we'll compare it to the median score for other companies in the sector.</p> <p>This way, we can use what we refer to as Factor Grades, and those are academic grades that range from F to A+. And when you see those grades, it gives you an instant characterization of how the metric for that company compares to the sector. And that basically gives us the notification if its strong or weak.</p> <p>So we have a proven track record at Seeking Alpha, and I will show you that. I mentioned the backtest goes back to 2010. Important to point out that at 2019, we actually weren't using the backtest. These are actually all the simulated trades that we have for our Strong Buys every day.</p> <p>So what you are seeing here is not really a product that you would invest in, so much as an indication of how our strategy operates. And within this, we're looking at all our Quant Strong Buys, going back to 2010, and refreshing our portfolio of Strong Buys every single day.</p> <p>So if a stock were to fall from Strong Buy to Buy or Hold, it would come out of this portfolio. So we're monitoring the performance of just our Strong Buys and it gets updated every day. And the performance has been terrific. If you were to invest $10,000 in 2010, you would have a return on $10,000 of $318,000 versus the same $10,000 if it was invested in the S&amp;P 500, you would have a return of $61,000.</p> <p>So on an annualized basis, our system has provided a return of 26%. So again, this is to really signify that our strategy works. This isn't showcasing any particular investment vehicle, just as much as our Strong Buys work based on the strategy we have.</p> <p>So where does this bring us going forward? Well, the markets, I think to say the least, have been very volatile for January. I feel like we've had three corrections in a very short period. We also had a lot of volatility in December. But for the most part, our markets in ‘23 and 2024 were very strong, but very concentrated, which were led by the Mag 7 stocks.</p> <p>And both those periods, we were really experiencing fears of inflation, concerns about how much interest rates would continue to go higher, and we certainly had the Federal Reserve over 2023 and early 2024 make multiple rate increases. It wasn't actually into the back half of 2024 that we started to see rates come down and that was a really strong catalyst because in the latter half of last year, we actually saw small caps starting to perform well.</p> <p>So that's really important part of our presentation going forward and what we're looking for in 2025. So obviously, there has been a great deal of concern over the tariffs, potential tariff wars. Of course, many investors and economists and strategists know that tariffs can often produce very high inflation.</p> <p>So there's been a lot of concern about that. And our guidance right now is just to keep calm and carry on. Some of these tariffs might stick. Some could just be jawboning on the part of the current administration and trying to negotiate better deals. Our feeling is that as the months go forward, some of these tariffs will stick, some will not stick, and they will be used for negotiating, but it's going to become part of the market norm. And we're not going to see quite the same gyrations going forward when there's discussion on tariffs.</p> <p>Having said that, we are also going into our third year of a bull market. And it's important to highlight this. Our research shows that as bull markets approach their third year, the likelihood of a market correction rises to 75%. As the bull market nears its third year anniversary, which would be in October of 2025 this year, the historical pattern suggests an increased probability of a correction, and we saw quite a few corrections this month, actually.</p> <p>Just highlighting Sam Stovall. He's fairly well known. He's a Chief Investment Strategist, and I like this highlight. He mentioned that the first year of presidential cycles feature an average stock market decline of 17%. The average time it takes for the market to recover that loss after a decline of 10% to 20% is about four months.</p> <p>So from his perspective, you're better off just being aware of the potential volatility and not necessarily reacting to it. And our research shows really one year after a new president is elected, the majority of the time, the market does finish up. So it is interesting to see that there is volatility during that first year. But overall, the markets typically do finish up.</p> <p>So it's important to become aware of that. And as that uncertainty is generated over the course of this year, whether it's tariffs or inflation or interest rates or regulatory change, you could actually use that uncertainty to your favor and buy during those corrections.</p> <p>So we're going to a period which I anticipate, of course, there's no guarantee, but I'd like to refer it as market normalization and what can come of that as the great rotation. So obviously, we came off of 2021 and 2022. There was the pandemic, a huge disruption to the markets, to the supply chain, to society in general.</p> <p>And then as we were going into 2023 and 2024, there were a great deal of concerns over rising inflation and interest rates. And that really was not a normal period. Basically, you could look at 2021 through 2024 as not a normal period. And as a result, we saw the Mag 7 stocks do incredibly well.</p> <p>Now, those are the seven largest stocks in the market. They have the biggest market-cap weights. They have the most profitability. They have the most cash. So as a defensive measure, many people invested in those stocks during those periods of uncertainty.</p> <p>However, there also was the beginning of the AI revolution of which many of those companies participate in terms of either investments or AI on their own platforms. And the attraction of being defensive, but also leading the AI revolution, put those stocks in a good place.</p> <p>However, as we come into 2025, we're in a period where interest rates have actually come down 3x in the back half of 2024, and we might be in a period where there could be stability. The Fed might not be as worried about inflation, and they may not be as worried about interest rates. They're not sure if they will be dropping significantly, really inflation. So as a result, the Fed could sort of just stand still for a while. But as they stand still, and we look at the potential events of the tariffs, that economic uncertainty, executive orders, changing regulatory environment, these gyrations that could occur will most likely just be that, gyrations. They're most likely won't be a systemic issue that alters the economy for the long-term. So we can actually see a flattening out of inflation and a flattening out of interest rates.</p> <p>So I sort of refer to this period and many other strategists call it a period of normalization. The conclusion is the Fed pausing rate cuts and the Mag 7 fatigue, so basically, they have had a tremendous run-up in the last two years and the stocks are actually going into a period where their forward earnings CAGR is lower than their year-over-year growth rates.</p> <p>So that means that when people are looking for investments, they want companies that are going to grow going forward. They don't necessarily want companies where the forward growth rates are going to be lower than the year-over-year growth rates.</p> <p>So the Mag 7 stocks may be seeing fatigue in terms of the price appreciation that they had. As a result, if we see the Fed pausing and the Mag 7 stocks basically getting tired out, we're likely to see a rotation that could be witnessed with sector rotation, style rotation, and importantly for this call today, market-cap rotation.</p> <p>So investors might be getting away from these mega-cap stocks and locking for large-cap stocks, big-cap stocks, or small-cap stocks. And really what the marketplace is going to look for is good valuation frameworks, diversification, and companies that have strong earnings growth. And we are seeing this from quite a few small-cap stocks. So it puts us in a really good place today. So without further ado, the 2025 SA Quant Top 10 Small-Cap Strong Buys.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: Hey Steve, real quick to your point though, about rotating out of Mag 7. Alphabet actually just announced earnings while we were here on this call today, missing their revenue by $170 million, beating on EPS by $0.02, stock’s currently down 7% after hours. So there is high valuations and high marks for these companies to try to maintain and people are looking for growth elsewhere.</p> <p><strong>SC</strong>: It is. And when you think about it, I think in 2024, the average performance of the Mag 7 stocks was 111%. That's like unheard of for companies that have market caps that size. And that was in the back of like significant appreciation from the previous year.</p> <p>So I think we are going to see that fatigue. But that fatigue is going to be well-justified by forward earnings growth rates that could be lower. And seeing those, I'm really glad you brought up the numbers on Google today.</p> <p>So it really – we'll see the market will probably correct and we continue to see Mag 7 stocks weak. But that corrective phase should be used as an opportunity to identify stocks with strong fundamentals, strong growth rates, and good valuation frameworks, and you're going to see that in many of the small-cap stocks.</p> <p>So from a Quant perspective, we're really not emotionally tied to Meta, to Google, to NVIDIA. We're data-driven process. So the Quant vision is to eliminate emotional investing and uncover top stocks using data-driven tactics. And as we have been discussing, there will be turbulent times, and we should use these turbulent times going forward to help focus on fundamentals.</p> <p>So let's turn the market weakness that we might see into opportunity, and we have 10 great stocks to do it. So here is the overall list. We have OppFi, we have Power Solutions, DXP Enterprises, Graham Corporation, Ceragon Networks, <a href=\"https://www.gambling.com/\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener\">Gambling.com</a>, Argan, Third Coast Bancshares, RADCOM, and Travelzoo. And Daniel, what I really like about this list compared to the Mag 7 is the Mag 7 is all technology. We really have some great diversification in this list here.</p> <p>And importantly, if you look over to the right side, sort of in the center, you'll see the Valuation Grades and you'll see the Growth Grades. And these Valuation Grades are way better than the Mag 7. For the most part if we had the Mag 7 up here, for the Valuation Grades, you'd be seeing Fs and Ds, because those stocks are extremely expensive and don't really justify the level of growth that they have.</p> <p>So we have a wonderful basket of stocks here that have excellent Valuation frameworks, excellent Growth, really solid Profitability, excellent Momentum. And as I mentioned, we are always looking for companies where analysts are taking our estimates up and we have almost straight As here across these 10 stocks.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: So diving into these stocks today, just want to go ahead and get this question out of the way because people like to ask it. We're going to kind of rank them 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, but does the actual ranking of how these stocks delivered today, does that matter based off of…?</p> <p><strong>SC</strong>: No.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: I have to ask, because it always comes in.</p> <p><strong>SC</strong>: Yeah, yeah. I mean, you will see that the Quant Rating, if you look more towards the left side next to the name of the company, you will see a Quant Rating. And some of these do have stronger ratings, but they're all Strong Buys with the exception of Travelzoo, which actually fell to a Buy.</p> <p>So we have nine Strong Buys and one Buy. You could say based on that type of ranking where it falls. But as I was putting the presentation together, I think I follow this order. I might not exactly follow this order. But if you are looking at these stocks, I would say look at the ones with the strongest Quant Rating to get an indication of the companies that have the best overall score. And when we're looking at the best overall score, especially for individuals who are new, that overall score is determined by the underlying factors.</p> <p>So we take the Valuation, Growth Grade, Profitability Grade, Momentum Grade, and the EPS Grade. And when we combine those scores, we come up with the overall Quant Rating. So you can see OppFi has one of the strongest ratings there, and that comes from the underlying metrics.</p> <p>So we'll start with Ceragon. So you could see it does not go any specific order. It's not following this necessarily. Ceragon is almost in the middle of the pack. But the first stock that we're showing here at number 10, it really is not number 10, it's just the order that we have.</p> <p>Again, this is a small-cap stock, currently a Strong Buy. It is in the IT sector, the specific industry that's in, communications equipment it ranks number two out of 44 companies, and they deliver end-to-end global wireless connectivity solutions, very good revenue growth compared to the sector. You’d see the forward revenue growth is 12%, almost more than double the sector at 5.56%. The EBIT growth year-over-year was a whopping 203% versus 5% for the sector. And the levered free cash flow growth year-over-year was 378% versus the sector at 15%.</p> <p>So you can see we have some terrific growth numbers here for both top line and bottom line. The third quarter of 2024, they hit an all-time record revenue at $50 billion. And that was, I'm sorry, that revenue was from its India segment, not for the overall company.</p> <p>As you look to the card that we have on the right side, you can see we have the Ratings Summary. So Seeking Alpha contributors rated a Buy, that's the consensus of our contributors. Wall Street consensus is a Buy, and the Quant Ranking is a Strong Buy. The Factor Grades below, again, those are relative to this IT sector. So it shows you the valuation for the IT sector is more attractive. The Growth is more attractive with the B+, Profitability is in line, the Momentum is definitely far superior to the IT sector, and the EPS Revisions are superior to the sector.</p> <p>And you can also see the Quant Rating history. So there are periods where we had a Buy, went to Hold where the stock stayed flat, another period where it was a Buy and the third quarter of last year kind of flattened out. But we were onto something and the stock did go to Hold, but then you could start to see it really started to make a monster move up.</p> <p>So – and it really concurs with the movement that a lot of small caps had. Small cap was not good during 2023 and 2024, just not the period. But in the second half of 2024, we started to see small cap come alive, especially as interest rates went lower. And these are – small-cap stocks are interest rate sensitive. Typically, the market views small-cap stocks as having a high degree of leverage. So high interest rates work against it. When interest rates start to head lower it benefits them because their interest rate payments are less.</p> <p>Travelzoo, our number nine stock here, has a market cap of $225 million. As I mentioned, this one actually has a Buy rating. It is in the communication services sector. It ranks 19 out of 233 companies in the sector, and specifically within their industry, which is interactive media and services, it ranks seven out of 59.</p> <p>So, Daniel, just to highlight the stocks that are higher within their industry and sector could be larger market-cap companies. So just as a reminder, we're focusing here on small-cap companies. This is an online media company offering travel, entertainment, and local experiences worldwide. The return on equity, which is a Profitability metric, is a whopping 57% versus the sector, which is almost like has no ROE.</p> <p>The revenue growth – the forward revenue growth is 11.4% versus the sector at 2.4%. Return on capital, another Profitability metric, was 2,003% - at a 2,003% premium to the sector. And you could see the Valuation on the far right side, a bit expensive compared to the sector, but on most other metrics, it looks great, Growth, Profitability, Momentum, and Analyst Revisions.</p> <p>Going to RADCOM, ticker symbol RDCM. This company also has a market cap of around $200 million. It is a Quant Strong Buy. Within its industry of application software, it ranks 23 out of 198 companies. This tech company offers native cloud services and a 5G network and solutions basically for telecom carriers. It's had a revenue growth rate going forward of 13.29% versus the sector of 5.56%, EPS growth year-over-year, a whopping 660% versus the sector at 9.9%, ROE growth at 486% versus a negative number for the sector of 3.8%. And in the last 90 days, two analysts have revised their estimates up and zero have revised it down.</p> <p>Taking it to our next stock, which is actually the financials sector, is Third Coast Bancshares, ticker symbol TCBX. The stock has had a really nice run as well. In the industry of regional banks, it actually ranks number two out of 254. This is a commercial banking provider. They've had great revenue growth, 11.3% versus the financials sector at 6.5%, and their EPS growth year-over-year, a whopping 40% versus the financials sector at 4.3%, very good ROE growth as well at 9% versus a mere 1% for the sector. And in the last 90 days, four analysts have revised their estimates up and zero have revised it down.</p> <p>Getting to our sixth listed stock here, Argan, ticker AGX. This is actually one of our top 10 stocks too for the year. Market cap is a little bit bigger at $1.8 billion, but certainly still on the small-cap range. It's in the industrials sector, and it ranks 14 out of 615 stocks. Within the construction and engineering, it ranks one out of 34 stocks. This company actually does have a Dividend Yield of 1.12%, and a Dividend Safety Grade of A.</p> <p>If you look at the bottom part of the slide, you'll see Dividend Grades for Safety, Growth, Yield, and Consistency. Dividend Grades are very unique to Seeking Alpha. We created Dividend Grades because many investors rely on dividends. So it's important to have stocks. If you do look for dividend yield that have a good Dividend Safety Grade. And we encourage people, if they have a stock that has a dividend, load up that portfolio, look at the Dividend Safety Grades, we typically like Dividend Safety Grades that are above C. And certainly with this Dividend Safety Grade coming in at A, it looks like it's in great shape.</p> <p>In terms of some of the financials, excellent year-over-year revenue growth at 53% versus 3.6% for the sector. Bottom line EPS growth at 93% versus 5.8% for the sector. And the ROE growth was 69% versus a negative sector median of 4.3%. I think I did forget to mention what they actually do. They provide technical consulting, including engineering, procurement, construction for the power generation market. So a great supplier for power companies, and obviously power companies have done extraordinarily well over the course of 2024 because of the demand for power from data centers that is being generated from AI. So it puts the supplier in the right place at the right time.</p> <p>Coming in at number five, we have <a href=\"https://www.gambling.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Gambling.com</a>. So, Daniel, as you probably know, we have a lot of gambling apps sweeping the country. And this company we felt was in a really good position. Market cap is just under $500 million. This is really – we label it sort of in the advertising sector. It comes in two out of 30. They offer performance marketing for global online gambling.</p> <p>Revenue – the forward revenue growth is 31% compared to the sector median at 2.4%. And bottom line, EPS, year-over-year growth, an incredible 306% versus 6% for the sector, and the ROE growth at 217% versus 0.5%. This company has a few more analysts covering it than some of our others. So in the last 90 days, I'm happy to report that five analysts have taken up their earnings estimates for the company and zero have taken it down.</p> <p>All right, coming down to our stock number four here, Graham Corporation, ticker symbol GHM. I really like this company. I interviewed the CEO and the CFO probably about a year ago, putting an article out on it and it was really good timing. This company has a market cap of about $490 million. In its industry, it's the in machinery and supplies and components, and it ranks number one out of 78 companies within its sector. It's in the industrial sector, and its industry is industrial machinery.</p> <p>They manufacture and design power, heat, and vacuum technologies for aerospace, defense, and various industries. The aerospace and defense is a really important sector to this company and it continues to grow and they have some great margins in that business. It's hard business to get, but once they get it, it's really good cash flow and really good margins.</p> <p>The revenue growth rate going forward for this company is 13% versus the industrial sector at 5% and EPS growth is tremendous. This is a forward EPS growth of 241% versus the sector at 8%. That's not a year-over-year number, that's actually a forward growth number. And we get our forward growth numbers basically by looking at analyst consensus estimates and we take the CAGR of the forward future growth rate, and it is, as I said, based off of Wall Street consensus.</p> <p>So a very, very strong EPS growth number there. And the return on equity growth year-over-year, 145% versus the industrial sector in the negative territory at 4.3% ROE growth. In the last 90 days, we've had three analysts take their estimates up and zero have taken it down.</p> <p>And coming to stock number three, DXP Enterprises, ticker symbol DXPE. This has a market cap of $1.5 billion. It is a trading company and distributor, and it ranks in our model one out of 44 companies within the industrial sector it ranks six out of 615. They offer technical expertise for distribution, maintenance, repair, and operation of products. And those products are mostly pumps, equipment, and services, which – the services being supply chain services in the U.S. and Canada.</p> <p>The company has a forward revenue growth of 7.7% and an operating cash flow growth rate of 152% versus the sector at about 11.5%. They have a very strong backlog. And in the third quarter, it hit a new all-time high adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.1%.</p> <p>Stock number two, Power Solutions International. This stock has been a huge success for us, PSIX. It has a market cap of $966 million, Quant Strong Buy, as you look at that Quant Rating history, going back to, it was a Hold basically over a year ago. And then you could see somewhere around May, we put the Strong Buy on it, and it's just been an exceptional return since that period.</p> <p>But despite the massive return that we've seen in the stock, you can see the Valuation is still fairly attractive. It comes in at a B- valuation compared to the sector. A year ago, it was an A valuation, but like B- is still very, very attractive, especially considering if you look at the growth rate for the company, it has an A+ grade for the growth rate now. And six months ago, it was actually a B growth rate.</p> <p>So the growth for the company now is stronger than it was six months ago. Hence, it's probably well worth the Valuation that you get for this company. They're in the heavy electrical equipment industry. They rank one out of 12. They provide auto manufacturers with power train products, engine blocks, and solutions, power systems, tailored for diverse needs. They've sold over 1.5 million engines.</p> <p>In Q3, 2024, net income was $17.3 million, up 122% year-over-year. Gross margins were 28.9%, up 5% year-over-year. And shareholder equity at $42.1 million, was up $46 million from December of 2023.</p> <p>And the number one stock, Daniel, which I think is up quite a bit today, OppFi, ticker symbol OPFI. This is one of our Top 10 Stocks for the year as well. You can see looking at the Quant Rating history, we put a Strong Buy in the stock probably around June of 2024, and you could see it's done absolutely fantastic. It's in the financials sector.</p> <p>And in the financials sector, it ranks three out of 688 financial institutions. And within its industry of consumer finance, it ranks number one out of 39. This is the fintech offering. And within their offering, they have simple and affordable credit solutions to underserved consumers that lack traditional options in rebuilding financial health.</p> <p>And I have to say, we recently came out with a number of companies that were in the financials sector. Some of the smaller fintech companies or even the large fintech companies, some of them missed on their earnings estimate. This company did not miss, and it has definitely been rewarded.</p> <p>The revenue growth year-over-year is 24% versus the financials sector at 5.7%. The EPS growth year-over-year, an incredible 776% versus the sector at 4.3%. Earnings per share growth in GAAP year-over-year, you see up 92,000% - or it’s a 92,000% premium to the sector. And in the last 90 days, two analysts have revised their estimates up and zero have revised it down.</p> <p>I'm actually going to take us to our platform, Daniel, and we're going to go to OppFi. So right now, I'm switching from our presentation to the Seeking Alpha platform. And we are on the stock page for OppFi. You can see the stock is actually up 8.93% today.</p> <p>If you look for the year, you could see the stock is up 383%. You may feel like you've missed this stock. But as I mentioned, if you go to the Factor Grades, and this is updated on a daily basis. The Valuation for this is A-. A year ago, it was an A.</p> <p>So the Valuation framework is almost exactly the same where it was six months ago, growth is an A+ now. It was an A+ six months ago. Profitability is actually a little bit improved. The Momentum and the Revisions, if you look at the EPS Revisions, it's actually in a better spot now with more analysts upgrading their earnings estimates than we actually had six months ago.</p> <p>So despite the fact that the stock has made a big run, the Valuation is still just as attractive. Now I'm going to click on the Valuation, and you're going to see some red here, okay? So what I want to highlight, the overall Valuation Grade is an A-. You'll see some of the conventional metrics such as P/E, trailing, or forward P/E, you'll see D. That means it's weaker than the sector.</p> <p>So we look at P/E GAAP forward, it's D+. Its multiple is 15x versus the sector at 12x. If we were to look at the trailing number, it's 36x versus the sector at 13x. So from a Valuation standpoint, looking at P/E, it does not look that attractive. However, when you look at PEG, which is one of my favorite ratios, and you actually combine the Valuation framework with the Growth framework together, it is an A+.</p> <p>So from the perspective of combining and blending both Valuation and Growth, and I like that grade because P/E just offers sort of what the Valuation is. I feel like really to get your head around a company, you have to sort of combine those metrics of P/E and Growth, hence PEG. And that is a great metric and it shows it's at a huge discount to the financial service sector.</p> <p>And you'll see there are some other metrics such as price-to-sales, which has an A for trailing and for forward. And you'll see price-to-cash flow is also an A+. So the grades that have the green versus the ones that have the red, basically could – not all these metrics are equal weighted in our algorithm. So you could see why that A is there for the overall Valuation Grade. Scores like PEG and scores like price-to-cash flow help bring up the overall Valuation Grade.</p> <p>If we were to click on Growth, and our system, Daniel, is really transparent. So when you see those grades, the reason why we show it is to give you an instant characterization where the company stands versus the sector. So when you look at it, it's very transparent because we actually show the data point for the company.</p> <p>So year-over-year revenue growth, you can see it's 23%. The sector median is 5.7%, hence the A grade on it. If you were to look below, look at the forward revenue growth, you can actually see the forward revenue growth is in line with the sector, hence the C+. But when you look at some of the bottom line numbers, especially for EPS growth, the forward growth is an incredible 205% versus the sector at 9.2%.</p> <p>So they're becoming obviously much more efficient and shareholders are being rewarded with the earnings per share. Really fantastic looking company. As I said, you compare it to companies like Citigroup, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo. So in the overall sector, it ranks three out of 688. And within the industry, it ranks one out of 39.</p> <p>So I just want to take us there. Some other pages that are interesting here, you can look at the ratings and we showed you the card before. So you can actually go back over a three-year period and see what our ratings are. Again, we're very transparent. We show the directional recommendation every single day, as well as the Valuation Grades, Growth Grades, Profitability Grades.</p> <p>So as a Seeking Alpha Premium member, you can go into this card and see where a stock trades every single day. And really notably, if we look at the Valuation, you can see after earnings, it changed from D+ to A+. So that Valuation still really looks fantastic. For the company, it went to a Strong Buy back at $3.40 and it's currently at $15. But the Valuation looks just as good now as it did six months ago, as well as the Growth.</p> <p>Back to our presentation.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: Steve, while you're going back, I just want to go ahead and mention to people too that those grades are updated every single morning before the market opens, right? So the question we always get is, how are you still talking about these stocks? I mean, people may have seen these stocks pop up in some of our other webinars.</p> <p>Well, the grades are still showing Strong Buy. The grades are updating every single day. The Valuation Grade still looks great. The Growth Grade still looks great. The Profitability looks great. The EPS Revisions are going to. I mean, this is a daily grade that helps just provide that clarity of what's going on with the fundamentals underneath the company.</p> <p><strong>SC</strong>: Yeah, I'm really glad you highlighted that, Daniel, because every day when you look at the stock, you should be looking at it as a new investment. And that's why we update our directional recommendation every single day. And that's why we upgrade our Factor Grades and our metrics every single day.</p> <p>If you were to look at a Wall Street research report from four weeks ago or from two months ago or three months ago, I really – I tell people for me, it would be impossible to make an investment decision based on a research report that was written a month ago or two months ago.</p> <p>When I make an investment decision, I want to see the data that day for the company. I want to see the data versus the sector. And that's what we do with our Factor Grades. That's why when you look at it now, you could say, as of today, this is a great investment compared to the rest of its sector. And certainly, the stock price has really been rewarding people.</p> <p>So I believe that brought us to all 10 stocks. And Daniel, there's a number of people who actually like to limit the amount of research that they have to perform. It's nice to get our Top 10 Stock picks in January, our top 10 small-cap recommendations. But after January, you have February, March, April, May, June. What do you do during those months?</p> <p>And for people who really don't have a lot of time to perform the research, or they want the research performed for them from individuals that are experts or systems that are highly successful, we do that.</p> <p>So I created about two-and-a-half years ago, a product called Alpha Picks. And with Alpha Picks, we simply pick our two favorite Quant Strong Buys every month. And we distribute those picks on the trading day closest to the first of the month and the 15th of the month by email to people who want to subscribe to Alpha Picks.</p> <p>So it's a service that's separate than Seeking Alpha Premium. And obviously, you saw our Quant Strong Buys have had a fantastic track record. We just try to make it less work for individuals, but have a consistent flow of ideas throughout the year. Alpha Picks was really designed for long-term investors who don't like to do a lot of trading.</p> <p>So occasionally, when a stock does go from a Strong Buy or Buy to Sell, we would issue a Sell and you would receive an email alert or it would be on the platform, or if a stock is a Hold, we actually keep it in the portfolio for 180 days. After 180 days of a Hold recommendation, at that point we make room for some of the other Strong Buys.</p> <p>So Alpha Picks is a great way to go for the remainder of the year if you don't want to do a lot of research, and we've had pretty good performance. As you can see, over a one-year period, Alpha Picks is up 43% versus the S&amp;P up 24%. And the last three months, it was up 11.5% versus the S&amp;P up 5.8%.</p> <p>And since inception, Alpha Picks is up 175% versus the S&amp;P up 59%. And very true to our Quant system, we like diversification. Stocks within Alpha Picks are all different market cap sizes. They could be small-cap, mid-cap, large-, and they're in all different sectors. So again, we're getting away from that concentration risk that you had with the Mag 7, and we've definitely been rewarded for that strategy.</p> <p>And, Daniel, that's it. Do we have any questions at all?</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: We do have questions. And I also want to point out, I think we had a Sell on the Alpha Picks portfolio today, actually. Locking in, I believe the gain was a bit over 200%, so well done.</p> <p><strong>SC</strong>: I'll take us to our platform and let me see if we can identify that.</p> <p>I’m going to actually go to our…</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: Yeah, it’s in the process of closing. So you got to go to portfolio and close.</p> <p><strong>SC</strong>: There you go. There it is.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: Right.</p> <p><strong>SC</strong>: Oh, yeah. So it hasn't shown it, but I think, yeah, triple-digit returns for MHO that will show tomorrow and it has been very, very successful. And you can actually check out the performance. We can actually click on one-year performance here, and this gets updated every day. You could click on the year-to-date performance and see how we've done. And if I were to go to the Performance page over here and just show current and look at the returns, you could see we have had some huge, huge winners.</p> <p>Super Micro Computer was a closed position. When we closed the first half, that was up 968%. AppLovin, which came in a little over a year ago, up 795%; Celestica has been an incredible stock, up 383%; and Modine Manufacturing, up 378%.</p> <p>So you can see we've had a great, great track record there, Daniel. So again, two ideas come out a month, the trading day closest to the first of the month and the 15th. And what we do is we send out an article and we keep track of all the articles. So every article that was written on one of our picks is on the system. So it's very, very transparent. And as you saw, if you go to the Performance page, we show the time that it was purchased, the return for not only the stock, but for the S&amp;P during the same period as well. So really excellent performance there overall.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: Yeah, thanks for taking the time to show us that. So let's dive into some questions. We had a question come in. So you did the backtest strategy of the Quant system and you designed it quite a while ago. So we had somebody asking, are you constantly like kind of changing over time as market conditions change how the Rating system of the Quant system works? Or is that baked into the strategy that it's one of those evergreen kind of things that work?</p> <p><strong>SC</strong>: Well, it is a fixed strategy. We have not changed the strategy. We have not changed the weighting on the metrics since I integrated into the platform. I will say, though, as Quants, it's sort of like a search for the Holy Grail. You're always checking out other factors and backtesting.</p> <p>But amazingly, this model has actually worked really well for me since like the year 2000. And when I was running the strategy off of the prop desk at Morgan Stanley, it performed very well. When I ran a hedge fund, it performed well. So there hasn't really been much need to change it. I guess if it's not broke, don't fix it. But we do constantly analyze other factors.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: All right. Thanks for diving into that. Let's see here. Yeah, there were a lot of questions, I think, we kind of talked about it. But people are kind of thinking about looking at these stocks that we've been talking about in this presentation today, seeing how much they've run up already, kind of might feel a little bit of remorse not getting in earlier and kind of fearful not jumping in right now. Is there anything that you might be able to shed light on as to beyond the rating system, maybe the Momentum that we like to talk about potentially, as to what stock…</p> <p><strong>SC</strong>: Yeah. So looking at the Top 10 Small-Cap Stocks here and looking at our ratings on them. So we will see that, we highlighted this before, like when we're looking at the Valuation Grade, most of these Valuation Grades are pretty good. You have two of them, Travelzoo and you have Graham, which have expensive Valuations, but the Growth rates are really, really strong.</p> <p>So again, I would sort of encourage individuals to keep in mind, you should look at this as a fresh investment every day. Today, the Top 10 Small-Cap Stocks are up 3.32%. So they have had a good run. But I would just say look at that performance as validation that the companies have done well. And again, you're looking at the Valuation frameworks and they're really pretty strong and the Growth is incredibly strong for these companies as well.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: All right. We got another question here about how the Quant system works. Are you looking at the strongest sectors when picking the strongest stocks to be a Strong Buy or is it just looking for strong stocks…?</p> <p><strong>SC</strong>: Yeah, this is a bottom-up approach. So we're really looking for stocks that have strong fundamentals. So we're looking at the individual names to make sure that they're collectively strong on Value, Growth, Profitability, Momentum, and Analyst EPS Revisions.</p> <p>So we look for them to be collectively strong on those. And the ones that have the best scores come to the top parts of our screen and then we recommend them. So it is not a top-down approach. We're not looking for sectors.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: Do you have any worry about short interest on these stocks?</p> <p><strong>SC</strong>: I do not because having being familiar with short interest and having backtested short interest, it's actually a horrible indicator of future performance. So I would not use short interest. And I've actually found over time, if you actually have stocks that have strong fundamentals that have a high short interest rate, typically, you get a short squeeze and the stocks go even higher. So I would definitely not use short interest as an indicator.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: All right. Thank you. About what time are the grades updated each morning?</p> <p><strong>SC</strong>: They get updated between 4 AM and 6 AM.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: All right. Thank you for that.</p> <p><strong>SC</strong>: That's for the entire universe, that's thousands and thousands of stocks.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: Luckily, we got supercomputers nowadays. How can a stock jump from a D grade to an A grade within one day with no earnings or major price changes?</p> <p><strong>SC</strong>: Well, the stock is being measured relative to the rest of the sector. So even if there's not a change on that stock per se, there could be a change on the other stocks that would impact that Valuation Grade.</p> <p>So remember, our grades here, they're all sector relative. So you're not looking at it in absolute terms, you're looking at it in relative terms of the sector. So even if there's no change specifically for that stock, it could be the other stocks that are forcing that change.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: Yeah, brilliant. How should people approach exiting positions of top stocks?</p> <p><strong>SC</strong>: Well, each individual has to look at their own risk tolerance. We can't really – we don't know what your risk tolerance is. We don't know how you would like to manage your capital. But if you were sticking to our system, I often say to people Hold means Hold. It doesn't mean Sell. We know to sell a stock when the rating drops to Sell or a Strong Sell.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: Perfect. All right, just kind of running through, there's a lot of them here. Do you combine technical analysis in the system at all?</p> <p><strong>SC</strong>: We do not look at technical analysis, but Momentum is an important factor. So I'll actually click on one of these stocks and the Momentum Grade. Let's look at OppFi. So I can actually just click on it here, and we look at four different time points. So we look at Momentum and factor that into our algo.</p> <p>We're looking at the time point of one-year, nine months, six months, and three months. And as you can see across all these various time points, the Performance of OppFi has absolutely crushed the sector. So we're not using technical analysis per se, but we do look at, in a way, relative strength to the sector median.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: We had a request real quick. Maybe you can go back to the slide deck and show the slide that had all 10 stocks listed out just to make sure the people here have that list before we jump…</p> <p><strong>SC</strong>: Yeah.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: Let’s go back to the slideshow. All right. We got a lot of thank yous in here. People agreeing that when I do call you the legend, they also agree that you are a legend, Steve. So thank you so much for the time today. We always love to hear from you.</p> <p>Let's go ahead and wrap it up here. Actually, everyone, thank you so much for taking the time to hang out with us today. Watch this webinar. If you're watching the replay, greatly appreciate it as well. There is a link beneath this video that we'll have for Alpha Picks.</p> <p>I highly encourage you to go check it out, I mean, the returns speak for themselves. The communication, the community there has been really tremendous to just watch grow over these, what has it been, two years, two-and-a-half years? I mean, it feels like we've been doing this quite a while.</p> <p>But Steve, thank you so much. I want to give it the floor to you anything you want to say before we hop off here today.</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> Yeah. So, Daniel, I want to thank everybody for attending this today and really they got a little bit of an edge because we're actually putting this article out tomorrow morning on our Top 10 Small-Caps.</p> <p>So if you were in today's webinar, you have sort of a preview as to the stocks that we'll be writing about tomorrow. Again, these stocks have excellent fundamentals, really great Growth, excellent Valuation frameworks, Profitability really fairly strong. And again, I want to express my appreciation to you, Daniel, for organizing this and to the viewers and subscribers at Seeking Alpha. Thank you.</p> <p><strong>DS:</strong> All right, everyone. Take care. Have a great rest of the week and we'll see you in the next webinar.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4755072-top-10-small-cap-stocks-amid-market-turbulence\">Check Out The Top 10 Small-Cap Stocks Amid Market Turbulence</a></strong></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder\"></div><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3K2unS3\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><strong>Join Alpha Picks Today!</strong></a></p>",
