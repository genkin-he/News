In another volatile quarter, small caps were up over 10% after November’s U.S. Presidential election but relinquished almost all those gains in December, with the U.S. Federal Reserve setting the tone for a slower-than-expected interest rate reduction in 2025. Despite the volatility, our U.S. Small Company Growth Composite Portfolio returned 5.09% gross of fees, and 4.73% net of fees, beating the Russell 2000 Growth Index. This marked an encouraging end to an overall disappointing year in which the Portfolio returned 4.9% gross of fees and 3.8% net of fees, underperforming the Russell 2000 Growth’s 15.2% return.</p> <p>Despite the Portfolio’s muted 2024 results, we believe the fundamentals of our Portfolio businesses are strong and improving. For much of 2024, the Russell 2000 Growth performance was largely driven by crowded AI trades and companies that stood most to benefit from declining interest rates (housing, biotech, and unprofitable “moonshot” companies such as space exploration, quantum computing, etc.). As evidence of this narrowness, the top ten contributors to the year’s Russell 2000 Growth performance accounted for nearly half of its return. This is decidedly not a conducive environment for most profitable, high-quality companies to outperform, and for us, it represented a meaningful headwind to relative performance.</p> <p>Among our Portfolio holdings, the market’s time horizon seemed to shrink significantly with a heightened focus on AI, excessively punishing businesses that did not meet expectations for the quarter well beyond what the underlying fundamentals would justify. Last quarter, we highlighted Goosehead Insurance (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GSHD\" title=\"Goosehead Insurance, Inc\">GSHD</a>) as an illustration of this—down 40% at one point and later rebounding 60% as fundamentals proved stronger than expected. We witnessed a continuation of this trend when companies reported earnings in October and November, which worked to our benefit in the fourth quarter.</p> <p>Many lower-quality companies did not meet our Flywheel framework for quality, weighing heavily on relative performance. The most notable example is Super Micro Computer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMCI\" title=\"Super Micro Computer, Inc.\">SMCI</a>), up nearly 190% in the first half of the year, driving a notable headwind.</p> <p>Particularly frustrating in this scenario—Super Micro was reconstituted out of the Index in late June and was down -62% in the second half of 2024. There are many other examples of this kind of high beta, AI-adjacent growth company outperforming the broader investable universe. While we did not own these stocks due to their low quality, which hurt our performance, we believe the Portfolio overall is well-positioned to benefit from Gen AI- driven transformation—albeit in a more sustainable, long-term manner.</p> <p>While volatility and narrowly defined, crowded trades in the Index have presented challenges, we believe these dynamics create an excellent environment for stock pickers with a long-term business-owner mindset. We remain focused on our collaborative, rigorous research process to identify the best long-term compounders in the small cap asset class. We aim to generate returns by identifying attractive businesses that are underappreciated for the duration of their long-term compounding potential. In environments like this, many are doubly underappreciated due to the market’s short-term focus and inability to see past the next rate-cut decision. This has led to crowding in some securities and skittishness in others.</p> <p><span>We use our five-point Flywheel investment criteria to see past the noise and rely on the research process to take multiple perspectives and leverage our team’s extensive collective experience. We are disciplined about paying the right price to reach our mid-teens return target and often utilize our library of vetted Flywheel companies to wait for the right opportunity to buy when volatility works in our favor. As a result, we are excited about the prospects for our Portfolio even as the economic environment remains uncertain. We focus on investing only in businesses that can self-fund their own growth and are positioned to advance their competitive advantages in any economic environment.</span></p> <h2><span>Portfolio Performance &amp; Attribution</span></h2> <p><span>During the fourth quarter, the Portfolio returned 5.1% gross of fees and 4.73% net of fees, compared to the Index return of 1.7%.</span></p> <p>The top contributors to the Portfolio’s relative and absolute performance during the quarter were <strong>Warby Parker (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WRBY\" title=\"Warby Parker Inc.\">WRBY</a>)</strong>, <strong>Revolve Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RVLV\" title=\"Revolve Group, Inc.\">RVLV</a>)</strong>, and <strong>Dutch Bros</strong>. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BROS\" title=\"Dutch Bros Inc.\">BROS</a>)</p> <p><strong>Warby Parker, </strong>a U.S.-based omnichannel retailer of eyewear products with a unique vertically integrated direct-to-consumer business model, reported encouraging quarterly results. The company experienced robust growth in its glasses business and continued momentum in contact lenses and optometry. The company’s substantial investment in optometrists is yielding results, driving improved gross margins through enhanced utilization. Warby Parker appears to be emerging from a challenging period that was adversely impacted by post-pandemic changes in consumer behavior. Management’s steps to reduce costs appear to be paying off. More recently we’ve seen fundamentals improve, with marketing spend recovering now that margins have settled. We believe the company can potentially enhance its profitability as demand recovers and it completes and capitalizes on heavy investments in areas such as optometry services, which previously weighed on margins.</p> <p><strong>Revolve Group</strong>, an online apparel retailer targeting primarily Millennial and Gen Z demographics, was another top performer, with the stock’s total return ending the year up over 100%. This strong performance followed a period of improving fundamentals after facing earlier challenges. While the consumer environment remains under pressure, we are encouraged by efforts to drive cost efficiencies, reduce return rates, expand product lines, and continue its international push. We believe Revolve is well- positioned to grow earnings at an accelerating rate over the near term while the long-term outlook remains intact.</p> <p><strong>Dutch Bros</strong>, a drive-through coffee and beverage company with just under 1,000 locations, reported compelling quarterly results, raising its full-year revenue and EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) guidance. Robust same-store sales and steady unit growth have driven top-line growth of +28% year-over-year. Earnings growth appears poised to accelerate as the company ramps up unit growth in 2025, innovates its menu (into the untapped opportunity to drive food sales), and margins inflect higher with scale. We believe it’s still early days for Dutch Bros, which has a unique concept and is just starting to tap into proven value drivers like online ordering and food. We believe Dutch Bros has the potential to be a substantially long-duration EPS (earnings per share) growth business.</p> <p>The most significant detractors from the Portfolio’s relative performance in the quarter were <strong>Insight Enterprises (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NSIT\" title=\"Insight Enterprises, Inc.\">NSIT</a>)</strong>, <strong>AMN Healthcare Services (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMN\" title=\"AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.\">AMN</a>)</strong>, and <strong>Option Care Health (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPCH\" title=\"Option Care Health, Inc.\">OPCH</a>)</strong>. The most significant absolute detractors were <strong>Insight Enterprises</strong>, <strong>Installed Building Products (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBP\" title=\"Installed Building Products, Inc.\">IBP</a>)</strong>, and <strong>Option Health Care.</strong></p> <p><strong>Insight Enterprises</strong>, a global provider of IT solutions to small- and medium-sized businesses across various end markets, disappointed during the quarter. Despite establishing itself as a trusted technology partner enabling IT modernization and cloud migration over recent years, revenue, margins, and forward guidance were below previous estimates for the quarter. This was driven by challenging IT spending trends in Insight’s underlying client base. Our research suggests the company will benefit from a return to normal IT spending levels as companies prioritize hardware upgrades and continue to migrate workloads to the cloud.</p> <p><strong>AMN Healthcare Services</strong>, the nation's largest healthcare staffing provider, saw fundamentals deteriorate over 2024 as the temp nurse staffing market endures a painful reset following a surge during COVID. Overall, the reset has been more severe than we initially expected and amplified by significant cost pressures as hospitals attempt to right-size their balance sheets. Ultimately, this contributed to an outsized negative stock reaction following earnings—a 30% decline—as investors questioned the timeline for a recovery in the temp nurse staffing market. While we believe the market will normalize and performance will improve, we currently have AMN under review, as dictated by our investment process.</p> <p><strong>Option Care Health</strong> is a healthcare company that provides home and center-based infusions. During the quarter, the company’s reported results raised red flags about its ability to sustain growth and margins, given drug pricing pressure from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and increased biosimilar competition. Historically, Option Care has effectively navigated biosimilar competition and, in some cases, even benefited; however, we believe these dynamics are evolving, making future outcomes harder to predict. Since we believe biosimilars will continue to gain traction, this leaves the Flywheel in question for Option Care, which ultimately compelled us to eliminate the position in favor of better opportunities in new ideas and existing holdings.</p> <h2><span>Portfolio Activity</span></h2> <p>During the quarter, we initiated positions in four new investments: <strong>Willscot Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WSC\" title=\"WillScot Holdings Corporation\">WSC</a>)</strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TREX\" title=\"Trex Company, Inc.\">TREX</a></strong>, <strong>Fabrinet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FN\" title=\"Fabrinet\">FN</a>)</strong>, and <strong>Belden (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BDC\" title=\"Belden Inc.\">BDC</a>)</strong>. We also added to several existing positions.</p> <p><strong>Willscot Holdings</strong> provides turnkey space and storage solutions with leading market share in North America, serving customers through 250 branch locations. The company offers mobile offices, portable storage containers, climate-controlled storage, clear span structures, and associated services, including delivery and installation. The business model is highly predictable as assets are leased with an average duration of three years—this stability has enabled management to allocate capital effectively. Construction markets (industrial, non-residential, and residential) have been sluggish over the last few years, and we anticipate an improved volume backdrop ahead. We expect this, combined with continued pricing gains through higher attach rates of their Value-Added Services, to lead to mid-teens EPS growth over the next five years.</p> <p><strong>Trex</strong> is the market leader in composite decking, uniquely positioned to benefit from rising demand for sustainable building materials and outdoor living spaces. Trex’s operational discipline, pricing power, and environmental differentiation support strong market share gains from wood alternatives. Its long-term growth is underpinned by robust consumer trends and secular tailwinds. We already own Trex in our U.S. SMID Company Growth Portfolio and decided to initiate a new position here, as we believe the stock is attractively priced, with fundamentals appearing to have bottomed likely to inflect positively.</p> <p><strong>Fabrinet</strong> is a leader in advanced optical and precision electromechanical manufacturing, delivering high-value components for data centers, cloud computing, and high-speed networks. The company benefits from strong secular growth drivers in AI, digitization and network infrastructure, an asset- light model, and consistent free cash flow conversion, positioning it for a robust earnings trajectory over the cycle. We are excited about Fabrinet’s growth as NVIDIA, its largest customer, continues to scale, and the company's telecom business also appears to be bottoming, which should provide added tailwind to growth.</p> <p>Finally, we started a new position in <strong>Belden</strong> as it is transforming into a solutions-driven leader in networking, connectivity, and security, focused on high-growth sectors like industrial automation, broadband services, and data centers. Its Solutions Transformation Strategy enables margin expansion, deeper customer relationships, and recurring revenue models, with a mid- single-digit annual revenue growth target and 10%-12% EPS growth through 2028. Belden’s strong balance sheet and disciplined management create additional upside opportunities.</p> <p>By contrast, we eliminated four positions— <strong>Option Care Health</strong>, <strong>Euronet Worldwide (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EEFT\" title=\"Euronet Worldwide, Inc.\">EEFT</a>)</strong>, <strong>NV5 Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVEE\" title=\"NV5 Global, Inc.\">NVEE</a>)</strong>, and <strong>Alarm.com (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALRM\" title=\"Alarm.com Holdings, Inc.\">ALRM</a>) </strong>—and also trimmed several existing positions.</p> <p>As noted earlier, we exited our position in <strong>Option Care Health</strong> after reported results raised red flags about their ability to sustain growth and margins with drug pricing pressure from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and increased biosimilar competition. The price curve of expensive drugs exiting exclusivity has been far steeper than a year ago—we concede this will be more challenging to predict than we initially anticipated. Thus, Option Care is not a good fit for our strategy.</p> <p>We exited <strong>Euronet Worldwide</strong> as we remain cautious about the existential challenges facing its ATM business due to the rapid shift toward a cashless society, which we believe limits the company’s appreciation potential even if the fundamentals remain strong. While we believe Euronet is still a very high-quality business, we identified better opportunities for our capital.</p> <p>With <strong>NV5 Holdings</strong>, we have concerns about execution and management effectiveness. While we like NV5’s collection of unique engineering and infrastructure-related assets, our expectation of the company successfully streamlining its disparate operations to drive better consistency has not played out as expected. With the thesis proving incorrect and concerns arising about NV5’s ability to meet our criteria for effective management and value-creating reinvestment criteria, we determined it was time to move on to better opportunities.</p> <p>We exited our position in <strong>Alarm.com</strong>, the cloud, SaaS-based (Software as a Service) software platform for residential and commercial security companies. While Alarm.com remains a high-quality business, the EPS growth and return profile no longer compared favorably to the new companies in our pipeline. We sold Alarm.com to make room for new ideas, as is consistent with our best ideas and opportunity cost-driven mindset.</p> <p>During the quarter we added to and trimmed existing holdings, largely reflecting the above-mentioned opportunity cost mindset. We added to positions with what we believe are better risk- reward profiles and stronger Flywheels, and trimmed positions largely due to valuation to fund new positions and add to existing holdings. During the quarter, we added to positions in <strong>Paylocity (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PCTY\" title=\"Paylocity Holding Corporation\">PCTY</a>)</strong>, <strong>Dutch Bros</strong>, <strong>SiteOne Landscape Supply (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SITE\" title=\"SiteOne Landscape Supply, Inc.\">SITE</a>)</strong>, <strong>Rambus (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RMBS\" title=\"Rambus Inc.\">RMBS</a>)</strong>, <strong>Applied Industrial Technologies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AIT\" title=\"Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.\">AIT</a>)</strong>, and <strong>Insight Enterprises</strong>. We trimmed positions in <strong>Goosehead Insurance</strong>, <strong>Warby Parker</strong>, <strong>Clearwater Analytics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CWAN\" title=\"Clearwater Analytics Holdings, Inc.\">CWAN</a>)</strong>, and <strong>Houlihan Lokey (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HLI\" title=\"Houlihan Lokey, Inc.\">HLI</a>)</strong>.</p> <h2>Outlook</h2> <p>As we look to 2025 and beyond, we are optimistic about our Portfolio companies’ EPS growth outlook and the relatively low valuations for small cap stocks. We also think business fundamentals are likely to improve due to growing evidence suggesting 2024 was the EPS bottom for small caps broadly, and the M&amp;A market may continue to improve on early gains in 2024. Under the Trump Presidency, we anticipate that reduced regulatory burdens and a focus to prioritize domestic businesses could disproportionately benefit small cap companies, as they typically generate the majority of their revenue in the U.S.</p> <p> </p> <p>We don’t expect persistent uncertainty will limit our ability to achieve our long-term return targets as the fundamentals of our Portfolio businesses and potential for superior earnings growth will ultimately drive the stocks. While we can’t predict what will happen in 2025, we are nonetheless prepared for continued volatility with economic uncertainty and shifting interest rate expectations. We have always aimed to invest in resilient businesses that can self-fund their own growth. This is a key tenet of our Flywheel investment criteria, which we consistently uphold in good times and in bad.</p> <p>Thank you for your interest in Polen Capital and the U.S. Small Company Growth Portfolio.

These can include economic growth, technological advancements, regulatory changes, or other external influences that enhance the performance of investments.</p> <p>Contribution to relative return: a measure of a security’s contribution to the relative return of a portfolio versus its benchmark index. The calculation can be approximated by the below formula, taking into account purchases and sales of the security over the measurement period. Please note this calculation does not take into account transactional costs and dividends of the benchmark, as it does for the portfolio. Contribution to relative return of Stock A = (Stock A portfolio weight (%) - Stock A benchmark weight (%)) x (Stock A return (%) – Aggregate benchmark return (%)).

The U.S. Dollar is the currency used to express performance. Returns are presented gross and net of fees and include the reinvestment of all income. Net of fee performance was calculated using either actual management fees or highest fees for fund structures.

By sector, health care and materials were the most significant detractors from market returns during the period. By country, Switzerland and France were the largest detractors while Israel and Singapore contributed to market performance.</p> <p><figure class=\"regular-img-figure\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/4/58280443-17386704095826647.png\" alt=\"Performance highlights\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2>PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE</h2> <p>The portfolio’s return was -8.46% (net) for the reporting period. This compares to the MSCI World ex USA Index that returned -7.43% for the same period.</p> <h3>Top contributors:</h3> <ul> <li>Airbus (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EADSF\" title=\"Airbus SE\">OTCPK:EADSF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EADSY\" title=\"Airbus SE\">OTCPK:EADSY</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. The France-headquartered aerospace and defense company’s stock price rose after releasing third-quarter results where order books were up in all divisions. The Airbus Commercial and Helicopters segments made significant year-over-year increases and order intake in the Space segment rose nearly 30%. Demand for the company’s products remains robust and the constraint is its ability to supply. Positively, inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2024 were 11% higher year-over-year. Further positive news came in early December when Airbus announced stronger than anticipated November deliveries. We appreciate management’s efforts to drive production volume growth, which will be a key to helping the company meet increasing demand over time.</li> <li>Fresenius Medical Care (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FMS\" title=\"Fresenius Medical Care AG\">FMS</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FMCQF\" title=\"Fresenius Medical Care AG\">OTCPK:FMCQF</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. The Germany-headquartered health care company’s stock price rose after reporting solid third-quarter results that tracked in line with our expectations and demonstrated ongoing recovery in the business. Fresenius Medical saw volumes improve, with same store sales returning to growth after years of Covid-19-induced decline. Moreover, self-help initiatives under refreshed management are gaining traction in driving margin expansion across both the services and products segments with significant additional room for improvement. We continue to see the new leadership team making the right decisions to drive profitability going forward and believe that Fresenius Medical can further close its performance gap to peers over the mid term.</li> <li>Accor (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACRFF\" title=\"Accor SA\">OTCPK:ACRFF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACCYY\" title=\"Accor SA\">OTCPK:ACCYY</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. The France-headquartered hotel company’s stock price rose after releasing solid third-quarter results where revenue per available room (RevPAR) was resilient, the pace of development improved, and raised profit guidance implies that Accor is converting the top-line performance to bottom-line progression. These results are consistent with two prongs of our thesis: that Accor’s southeast Asia and Middle East footprint should support longer tailed RevPAR growth and that Accor’s newly implemented steering model to differentiate between economy hotels and luxury franchises should enable improved execution. In addition, AccorInvest successfully refinanced its debt and disposed of assets, which brings closer additional capital return to Accor shareholders. We continue to appreciate the company’s asset-light hotel franchising and think that shareholder returns should continue to improve over time.</li> </ul> <h3>Top detractors:</h3> <ul> <li>Bayer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAYZF\" title=\"Bayer Aktiengesellschaft\">OTCPK:BAYZF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAYRY\" title=\"Bayer Aktiengesellschaft\">OTCPK:BAYRY</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The Germany-headquartered agriculture and pharma company’s stock price declined following developments in polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) litigation and soft preliminary 2025 guidance. In October, the Washington Supreme Court granted review for the plaintiff’s appeal of Bayer’s first win at appellate court in PCB. Bayer’s appellate win, if enforced, will result in existing cases being retried on different grounds, but the Washington Supreme Court review raises the risk that the win is overturned. We viewed the appellate win as helpful but not a skeleton key to litigation resolution, so the Washington Supreme Court development is only marginal to value. In November, Bayer issued preliminary 2025 guidance indicating that profits would likely decline. The seemingly implied decline in agriculture business profitability was particularly disappointing versus consensus. This was partially driven by temporary regulatory issues that we expect to resolve in the mid-term, and the balance was driven by challenges in the crop protection portfolio. Bayer is now kicking off a deep restructuring of crop protection that we expect to help offset pressures and drive recovery. Overall, despite current headwinds, we believe that new CEO Bill Anderson’s restructuring and organizational change initiatives will unlock improved performance at Bayer and better capitalize on the potential of its well-positioned franchises. We are watching closely for evidence of success as Bill’s strategy enters its second year.</li> <li>Glencore (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLCNF\" title=\"Glencore plc\">OTCPK:GLCNF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLNCY\" title=\"Glencore plc\">OTCPK:GLNCY</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The Swiss-based and U.K.-listed diversified metals and mining company’s stock price declined despite third-quarter production results that were in line with consensus expectations. In addition, the company reiterated guidance for the year. The stock’s current underperformance can be partially connected to economic sluggishness in China, the largest commodity buyer in the world. Despite this macro challenge, we continue to believe in Glencore’s management team and appreciate its focus on improving its return on invested capital. The company has leading positions in attractive commodities and latent growth potential in its copper portfolio. As macroeconomic headwinds in key markets subside, we think Glencore can leverage its unique asset and business mix to create further value for shareholders.</li> <li>Kering (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PPRUF\" title=\"Kering SA\">OTCPK:PPRUF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PPRUY\" title=\"Kering SA\">OTCPK:PPRUY</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The France-headquartered luxury goods company reduced 2024 guidance along with third-quarter results as key brand Gucci continued to suffer from low demand for its carryover bags. We are encouraged, however, by the performance of new product launches which should continue to increase the sales mix going forward. We believe Kering is making the proper long-term investments for Gucci and its other brands to capture future growth of the luxury goods market and we continue to see attractive upside in the stock.</li> </ul> <h2>PORTFOLIO POSITIONING</h2> <p>We initiated the following position(s) during the period:</p> <ul><li>KB Financial Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KB\" title=\"KB Financial Group Inc.\">KB</a>) is a leading Korean bank that provides a range of financial products and services, including retail banking, corporate banking, wealth management, and international banking services. Korean banks have a history generating uninspiring returns on equity (ROE) and low payout ratios (POR), and despite recent geopolitical uncertainty, there is broad support for the government's value-up program which aims to address these issues by encouraging better corporate governance, transparency, and improved capital efficiency. As Korea's largest bank, KB Financial possesses the industry's strongest capital position, a renowned low-cost deposit franchise, and leading fee income, which we believe advantageously positions the company to lead the now improving banking industry in both the speed and magnitude of improvements to POR. In addition, we appreciate management's focus on shareholder return because the anticipated growth in dividends and buybacks provides downside protection if the multiple expansion portion of the thesis sputters. Despite this compelling set-up, we were excited to purchase shares at an attractive valuation for a bank commonly acknowledged as the best bank in Korea, per our channel checks.</li></ul> <p>We did not eliminate any positions during the period.</p> <h2>OUTLOOK</h2> <p>As we look forward to 2025, we note that the spread between growth and value remains especially wide relative to history, both in US and international markets. Given this, we believe that it’s an unusually attractive time to be a value investor. This growth-led market environment has afforded us an excellent opportunity to build very well-diversified portfolios in companies trading at significantly lower than average valuations across a variety of industries. We remain optimistic about the positioning, strength and depth of opportunity set as we continue to find high-quality businesses trading at bargain prices.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p><strong>Past performance is no guarantee of future results.</strong> The investment return and principal value of this portfolio and any particular holdings may fluctuate.
