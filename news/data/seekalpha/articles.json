By sector, information technology and consumer discretionary contributed the most to market returns, while health care and materials were the biggest detractors.</p> <p><figure class=\"regular-img-figure\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/4/58280443-17386595431398509.png\" alt=\"Performance Highlights\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2>PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE</h2> <p>The portfolio’s return was 2.03% (net) for the reporting period. This compares to the Russell 1000 Value Index that returned -1.98% for the same period.</p> <h3>Top contributors:</h3> <p>Wells Fargo was a contributor during the quarter. The U.S.-headquartered diversified bank’s stock price rose after reporting what we see as solid third-quarter earnings where the company’s efficiency ratio continued to improve as expenses were well controlled. The fee income segment also performed well, growing 12%. In addition, Wells Fargo had the opportunity to repurchase $3.5 billion in shares during the period, bringing the full-year repurchase to roughly $16 billion. In November, the stock price continued its upward trend following the U.S. presidential election as investors are optimistic that the financials sector will benefit from looser regulations and lower corporate taxes, thus stimulating a better environment for dealmaking. We continue to believe that Wells Fargo is a competitively advantaged bank that can use its superior business mix and return potential to unlock further value.</p> <p>Salesforce was a contributor during the quarter. The U.S.-headquartered application software company’s stock price rose following the release of third-quarter earnings where metrics were strong across the board. Revenue modestly outperformed consensus expectations and management increased the low end of its guidance for the year. In addition, margins continued to expand and Salesforce (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRM\" title=\"Salesforce, Inc.\">CRM</a>) launched its new AI-based product Agentforce, which closed 200 deals in its first week with several Fortune 500 companies as early adopters. We appreciate the company’s strong competitive position and management’s commitment to maximizing shareholder value. General Motors was a contributor during the quarter. The U.S.-headquartered automobile manufacturer’s stock price rose aided by solid third-quarter results and increased full-year guidance for adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), earnings per share and free cash flow. The company repurchased USD 1 billion in stock during the quarter and suggested the pace of repurchase will increase near term. General Motors also issued better than expected initial 2025 guidance that calls for adjusted EBIT to come in a similar range to 2024. We believe the company is well-positioned to compete in an evolving auto industry, is significantly undervalued, and that per share value is being enhanced as the company continues to repurchase shares at a significant discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.</p> <h3>Top detractors:</h3> <ul> <li>Centene (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CNC\" title=\"Centene Corporation\">CNC</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The U.S.-headquartered managed health care company’s stock price declined despite releasing third-quarter results that showed resilient fundamentals in the face of short-term industry pressure. Centene also issued above consensus guidance for 2025 earnings per share (EPS) at its December investor day. We believe the largest driver of the stock price decline in the quarter was investor concern around how legislative changes following the recent U.S. presidential election could impact the company. In our view, this unease is overly discounted into the share price. We see Centene as having significant embedded earnings power that can drive continued EPS growth even with a less accommodative political backdrop. Shares trade at less than 8.5x 2025 EPS guidance, which we think is a compelling valuation for a business that generates healthy returns on capital and operates in a secularly growing industry.</li> <li>IQVIA Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IQV\" title=\"IQVIA Holdings Inc.\">IQV</a>)was a detractor during the quarter. The U.S.-headquartered life sciences tools and services company’s stock price declined due to a reduced near-term outlook in its R&amp;D solutions segment primarily related to a program cancellation and the delay of two large clinical trials that will resume in 2025. However, we believe that the headwinds in this part of the business should abate over the course of 2025. We are also encouraged that growth in the technology and analytics solutions segment is recovering as expected. We believe IQVIA stock is cheap at a mid-teens multiple of normal earnings power.</li> <li>Celanese (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CE\" title=\"Celanese Corporation\">CE</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The U.S. headquartered specialty chemicals company’s stock price declined after reporting third-quarter earnings that reflected continued pressure from weak end markets. The engineered materials segment detracted most from performance due to declines in auto production rates, particularly in Europe. Celanese's free cash flow remained challenged due to underwhelming earnings, and a larger than expected working capital outflow. In addition, the company's financial leverage came under the spotlight after acquiring DuPont Mobility and Materials. After a challenging year, Celanese announced that CEO, Lori Ryerkerk will step down and be replaced by Scott Richardson who has been with the company for two decades and is currently serving as COO. Despite current headwinds we see Celanese as a clear leader in engineered materials that offers an attractive upside.</li> </ul> <h2>PORTFOLIO POSITIONING</h2> <p>We initiated the following position(s) during the period:</p> <ul> <li>Airbnb (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABNB\" title=\"Airbnb, Inc.\">ABNB</a>) is an online marketplace to list, discover and book unique accommodations worldwide. The company benefits from a strong network effect between its guests and hosts. We believe there is a long growth runway as global travel is an attractive market, and alternative accommodations have been taking share. We anticipate Airbnb will drive further growth by creating more valuable services for both sides of its network, which includes the potential for paid placement, which has created significant economic value for comparable marketplaces. In our view, management is aligned with shareholders and well qualified to lead Airbnb as the company attempts to capture these growth opportunities. Short-term concerns about the macro travel environment and declining margins stemming from growth investments allowed us to purchase shares at a discount to our estimate of business value.</li> <li>Elevance Health (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ELV\" title=\"Elevance Health, Inc.\">ELV</a>) is one of the nation’s largest managed care organizations. We believe managed care is an attractive industry, as health expenditures have historically outpaced GDP, and the short business cycle allows companies to quickly correct underwriting mistakes. More recently, managed care stocks have underperformed the market as the industry is facing headwinds due to mismatches between reimbursement rates and medical costs. We believe this will prove transitory and that changes to pricing and/or plan designs will help realign profit trends over time. While we acknowledge that a return to “normal” profitability will take a few years, we believe the stock is trading at a depressed multiple of depressed earnings and for a significant discount to both the broader market and the companies’ own trading history. With its unmatched scale, diversification across end markets, and track record of disciplined underwriting and capital allocation, we believe that over time, the market will once again recognize Elevance as a high-quality franchise with above average growth characteristics.</li> <li>GE HealthCare Technologies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GEHC\" title=\"GE HealthCare Technologies Inc.\">GEHC</a>) is a leading global medical technology company that was spun off from GE in January 2023. As a standalone company, we expect GE HealthCare to benefit from increased focus, better aligned management and incentives, and an improved corporate culture. We believe this will help drive higher margins and sustainably higher organic growth over time. Additionally, we believe GE HealthCare is well-positioned to capitalize on technology trends in healthcare as an increasing portion of the value proposition comes from artificial intelligence-enabled software, as well as a shift towards precision care. In our view, investors have a stale perception of GE HealthCare and haven't given the company credit for significant self-help potential or the improving long-term industry outlook. This, combined with excessive short-term concerns around weak industry demand in China, provided us with the opportunity to purchase shares at a discounted valuation to other quality medical technology companies.</li> </ul> <ul><li>Keurig Dr Pepper (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KDP\" title=\"Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\">KDP</a>) is one of North America's leading beverage companies, with dominant positions in single-serve coffee and flavored soft drinks. The soft drink portfolio has an enviable track record of volume growth and market share gains. We believe this strong performance can continue well into the future thanks to favorable demographic trends, brand strength, and its unique distribution network. Recently, the stock price came under pressure due to fundamental weakness in the Keurig coffee division. At-home coffee consumption normalized as people returned to work, while price hikes are also weighing on demand. We believe these industry-wide challenges will prove transitory, as coffee remains a popular beverage across demographics. Keurig is poised to capitalize on this demand with the largest installed base of single-serve brewers and ample runway to further increase household penetration. At the current quote, the market ascribes minimal value to Keurig. We were happy to purchase shares in this above-average business that is trading at a discount to the market, other beverage peers and private market transactions.</li></ul> <ul><li>The Carlyle Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CG\" title=\"The Carlyle Group Inc.\">CG</a>) is one of the largest global alternative asset managers and is particularly well regarded for its private equity franchise. Compared to peers, the firm over-indexes to private equity, which is considered to be a relatively mature industry vertical, and under-indexes to faster growing verticals like private credit. This has caused Carlyle’s share price to lag its competitors. However, we believe Carlyle’s new management team is taking the right steps to continue expanding the firm’s platform beyond its private equity roots and see this as an opportunity to accelerate organic growth. Further, we believe Carlyle’s brand and distribution capabilities position the firm especially well for growth in the retail channel, where allocations to alternatives are expected to expand significantly in the coming years. Despite the firm’s attractive and improving outlook, Carlyle trades at less than half the P/E of its peer group and at a meaningful discount to other financials with a comparable growth profile.</li></ul> <p>We eliminated the following position(s) during the period:</p> <ul> <li>Altria (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MO\" title=\"Altria Group, Inc.\">MO</a>)</li> <li>eBay (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EBAY\" title=\"eBay Inc.\">EBAY</a>)</li> <li>Goldman Sachs (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GS\" title=\"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\">GS</a>)</li> <li>Salesforce</li> <li>Truist Financial (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TFC\" title=\"Truist Financial Corporation\">TFC</a>)</li> <li>Walt Disney (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>)</li> </ul> <h2>OUTLOOK</h2> <p>As we look forward to 2025, we note that the spread between growth and value remains especially wide relative to history, both in US and international markets. Given this, we believe that it’s an unusually attractive time to be a value investor. This growth-led market environment has afforded us an excellent opportunity to build very well-diversified portfolios in companies trading at significantly lower than average valuations across a variety of industries. We remain optimistic about the positioning, strength and depth of opportunity set as we continue to find high-quality businesses trading at bargain prices.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p><strong>Past performance is no guarantee of future results.</strong> The investment return and principal value of this portfolio and any particular holdings may fluctuate.

In Q4, US equities reached their highest-ever valuations on nearly all reliable metrics. <sup>1</sup> In November, US junk bond spreads were only ~20bps from their all-time low on the eve of the 2007-08 financial crisis. <sup>2</sup> </li> <li>True to his mantra of being fearful when others are greedy, in Q3, Warren Buffett increased his cash allocation to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brianhirschmann_warren-buffett-has-never-been-more-bearish-activity-7260720224683909120-cqD_?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\" rel=\"nofollow\">an all-time high</a> as investors decreased their cash allocation to an all-time low. <sup>3</sup> </li> <li>This month, the 30-year TIPS yield reached its highest level since 2003 (excluding a two-month blip in 2008). <sup>4</sup> I have often warned that US government debt is at levels that have nearly always led to default (see <a href=\"https://www.hcapital.llc/_files/ugd/dc7287_15b99549af024013a0a0d377065bf39f.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">2020</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hcapital.llc/_files/ugd/dc7287_1e0c9db4d1154750b78b090c86ac3953.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">2023</a> letters). Surging yields are precisely how a debt crisis might begin.</li> <li>In H2, the unemployment rate spiked, <sup>5</sup> full-time employment declined, <sup>6</sup> and the yield curve uninverted. Those signals accompanied 7 of the last 7 US recessions with no false positives. As <a href=\"https://www.hcapital.llc/_files/ugd/dc7287_8711cf9ca60e498ea2dbc7f026a743f8.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">I previously wrote</a>, a recession should trigger a US government debt crisis.</li> <li>Seven of the world's ten largest real estate markets are very overvalued if not bubbles. <sup>7</sup> It would be eight of ten if Germany's real estate market had not recently crashed due to higher interest rates. Higher bond yields mean the remaining seven (US, China, Japan, India, UK, France, and Canada) may soon follow, torpedoing global wealth.</li> </ul> <p>After an update on our gold mining equities (GMEs), I discuss why Toronto Stock Exchange gold mine developers are an exceptional opportunity to profit from the looming crisis.</p> <h2>Portfolio Detail</h2> <p>The Fund's portfolio is summarized below:</p> <span class=\"table-responsive\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p><strong>Portfolio Weight</strong></p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Security</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Dec-24</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Jun-24</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>H2 '24 Return Contribution </strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Price / Intrinsic Value</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GME C1</p></td> <td><p>33.7%</p></td> <td><p>52.3%</p></td> <td><p>17.6%</p></td> <td><p>108.5%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GME G2</p></td> <td><p>10.7%</p></td> <td><p>11.5%</p></td> <td><p>0.8%</p></td> <td><p>33.3%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GME C3</p></td> <td><p>9.8%</p></td> <td><p>1.1%</p></td> <td><p>3.9%</p></td> <td><p>23.5%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GME S</p></td> <td><p>7.9%</p></td> <td><p>4.6%</p></td> <td><p>4.3%</p></td> <td><p>1.7%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GME F</p></td> <td><p>6.6%</p></td> <td><p>4.5%</p></td> <td><p>-1.2%</p></td> <td><p>5.6%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GME E</p></td> <td><p>6.3%</p></td> <td><p>2.7%</p></td> <td><p>-2.8%</p></td> <td><p>2.7%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GME U</p></td> <td><p>6.0%</p></td> <td><p>Not Held</p></td> <td><p>-0.8%</p></td> <td><p>22.2%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GME N</p></td> <td><p>4.7%</p></td> <td><p>6.4%</p></td> <td><p>-1.1%</p></td> <td><p>10.9%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GME Z</p></td> <td><p>3.1%</p></td> <td><p>Not Held</p></td> <td><p>-0.1%</p></td> <td><p>17.9%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GME E2</p></td> <td><p>2.4%</p></td> <td><p>Not Held</p></td> <td><p>0.1%</p></td> <td><p>13.3%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GME X2</p></td> <td><p>1.6%</p></td> <td><p>Not Held</p></td> <td><p>0.1%</p></td> <td><p>16.7%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GME D2</p></td> <td><p>1.5%</p></td> <td><p>1.6%</p></td> <td><p>0.0%</p></td> <td><p>16.9%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GME C2</p></td> <td><p>1.4%</p></td> <td><p>6.3%</p></td> <td><p>2.6%</p></td> <td><p>82.3%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GME S2</p></td> <td><p>1.2%</p></td> <td><p>Not Held</p></td> <td><p>0.0%</p></td> <td><p>12.9%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GME G3</p></td> <td><p>1.1%</p></td> <td><p>0.4%</p></td> <td><p>0.2%</p></td> <td><p>18.0%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GME P</p></td> <td><p>1.1%</p></td> <td><p>Not Held</p></td> <td><p>-0.4%</p></td> <td><p>6.7%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GME U2</p></td> <td><p>0.9%</p></td> <td><p>Not Held</p></td> <td><p>0.0%</p></td> <td><p>24.8%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GME O2</p></td> <td><p>0.5%</p></td> <td><p>2.5%</p></td> <td><p>2.5%</p></td> <td><p>N/A</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GME A</p></td> <td><p>Sold</p></td> <td><p>6.3%</p></td> <td><p>-6.3%</p></td> <td><p>N/A</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Total GMEs</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>100.4%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>100.2%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>19.2%</strong></p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Cash</p></td> <td><p>-0.4%</p></td> <td><p>-0.2%</p></td> <td><p>0.0%</p></td> <td><p>100.0%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Total</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>100.0%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>100.0%</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>19.2%</strong></p></td> <td> </td> </tr> </table>\n<span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\"></span></span><button class=\"table-enlarge-button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"table-enlarge-icon\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z\"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span> <span class=\"table-responsive\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table><tr><td>Prices are as of Dec. 31.

Due to C1's increased valuation and portfolio weight, I reduced the Fund's C1 shares by 44% in H2.</p> <p>GME C3 (\"C3\") appreciated after gold production commenced at two of C3's three deposits. C3 has no debt and is expected to increase gold production substantially over the next few years.</p> <p>GME C2 (\"C2\") appreciated after production started at its second gold project. Due to C2's increased valuation, I reduced the Fund's C2 shares by 81%.</p> <p>GME O2 (\"O2\") appreciated after it agreed to a takeover offer from a larger gold mining company. Although the takeover price was less than O2's intrinsic value, <sup>9</sup> the Fund earned a ~50% cumulative return over ~2 years.</p> <p>GME E (\"E\") declined after a Q4 equity raise. As shown above, however, E's valuation is extremely low. E should appreciate in 2025 when E announces a new gold resource estimate and production plan.</p> <p>GME A (\"A\") was written off by the Fund after the bankruptcy process rendered the shares worthless. The company could have avoided bankruptcy by hedging gold price risk with put options rather than forward contracts, which can become a large liability when gold prices rise. I will encourage our other GMEs to avoid the same mistake.</p> <h2>Developers</h2> <p>When gold prices increase, the value of a producing gold mine (\"producer\") grows faster than the gold price because production costs are relatively fixed. For instance, if gold rises 10% and a mine has a 10% profit margin, its profits will double as costs stay the same.</p> <p>A gold mine developer (\"developer\") is not yet producing gold but plans to do so by building a mine. When gold rises, developers tend to appreciate more than producers because:</p> <p>A developer's construction costs add fixed costs that increase the sensitivity of a mine's net present value to changes in gold prices. Developers usually issue equity to fund mine construction. As gold prices drive up share prices, developers can raise additional equity capital with less dilution.</p> <p>Hence, from 1979 to 1980, developers and other non-producing gold equities appreciated 2300%, far outstripping gold (161%) and producers (290%). <sup>10</sup> However, the chart below shows that, despite rising gold prices, Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) developers have underperformed gold and producers since 2021. <sup>11</sup> This underperformance is almost certain to reverse.</p> <p><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/4/542689-17386576504003983_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"959\" data-height=\"704\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/4/542689-17386576504003983.png\" alt=\"Since 2021, TSX Developers Have Lagged Gold &amp; Producers\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></span></picture></figure></p> <p>Due to developers' recent underperformance, many are trading at a fraction of intrinsic value. Examples include GMEs E, F, and S2 in the Portfolio Detail table above. The Fund has exited many past developer investments as they converged with intrinsic value (e.g., Atlantic Gold and Capricorn Metals). I expect similar or better results from our current holdings.</p> <p>TSX developers also appear undervalued relative to producers and Australian Stock Exchange ('ASX') developers. TSX developers are trading at ~$25 per gold resource ounce. In comparison, the largest producers in the GDX, the main gold mining ETF, trade at ~$300 per ounce, <sup>12</sup> and ASX developers trade at ~$50 per ounce. <sup>13</sup></p> <p>Bears' concerns about developers seem overblown. Although production and construction costs have increased, gold prices have increased much more. <sup>14</sup> Although new mines have geological risk, that risk is diversifiable and diminishes as gold prices rise. Developers' valuations are low even if dilution from future equity issuance is large.</p> <p>Developers' low valuations should cause producers to acquire more developers (e.g. the takeover of GME O2 at a ~60% premium in H2). Indeed, many developers are trading for much less than the cost to find and confirm new deposits through drilling (often more than $100/ounce). To paraphrase T. Boone Pickens, it is now far better to look for gold on the floor of the TSX than in the ground.</p> <p>Developers have suffered as investors have chased the bubbles in US equities and <a href=\"https://www.hcapital.llc/_files/ugd/dc7287_15b99549af024013a0a0d377065bf39f.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">cryptocurrencies</a>. However, with those bubbles likely to burst soon and gold likely to soar in response, investor sentiment toward developers may soon change. Since developers' total market capitalization (of less than $30bn) is tiny compared to US equities (~$60tn) and cryptocurrencies (~$4tn), small allocation shifts could cause developers to skyrocket.</p> <h2>Other</h2> <p>I continue to be the Fund's second-largest investor and have most of my net worth invested in the Fund.</p> <p>The Fund's next letter is scheduled for mid-July. However, I expect to provide performance updates before then. Partners' account statements will be uploaded shortly to the <a href=\"https://www.navconsulting.net/NavPortal/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">administrator's portal</a>.</p> <p>In August, I was <a href=\"https://www.hcapital.llc/media\" rel=\"nofollow\">interviewed</a> on the EisnerAmper Engaging Alternatives podcast. As of January 2025, the Fund had 30 clients (i.e., limited partners).</p> <p>K-1s are scheduled for February. The Fund continues to focus on tax efficiency and has yet to incur any significant short-term capital gains. Unlike more than 99% of hedge funds, <sup>15</sup> the Fund has no non-deductible management fees.</p> <p>I occasionally post comments relevant to the Fund on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HCapitalLLC\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a> and, less frequently, on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianhirschmann\" rel=\"nofollow\">LinkedIn</a>.

Junior Gold Miner Index is the MVIS Global Junior Gold Miners Index. The TSX developer index includes AOT, FF, FURY, GSHR, ITR, KORE, LGD, NEXG, OIII, PRB, SKE, SPA, STLR, TLG, VGZ and WM. Those companies operate in the US, Canada, and Australia. For the three companies that had large mergers during the period, the index measures their TSX share price change. For the rest, the index measures their change in market capitalization (to capture the effect of share issuance). First Mining Gold published a similar chart and deserves credit for the idea.

Newmont's copper resources are assigned zero value.</p> <p>13 This is an equal-weight average of seven ASX-listed developers (AAR, AUC, AZY, HRN, KAI, MAU, and RXL) that operate in Australia. ASX developers have benefited from faster permitting and favorable currency trends. However, that does not explain TSX developers' low valuation. The likely explanation is that TSX investors have been more distracted by the US equity bubble. Unsurprisingly, in recent years, ASX producers have acquired several TSX developers to arbitrage the valuation difference.</p> <p>14 This is shown in the chart by the increase in the \"Real Gold Price,\" which is calculated by dividing nominal gold prices by the Consumer Price Index. Recent changes in the Consumer Price Index approximate recent changes in mining and construction costs.</p> <p>15 Source: Guy Spier.

The Fund's principal objective is to achieve positive market returns primarily through fundamental analysis of small- and micro- cap equities in U.S. and foreign markets. Hirschmann Capital LLC (the \"General Partner\") seeks to achieve the Fund's investment objective by identifying equities that are trading at large discounts to actual value. The Fund invests primarily in small- and micro-cap equities in U.S. and foreign markets but also invests in other securities. An investment in the Fund should be considered a long-term investment.</p> <p>The information contained herein reflects the opinions and projections of the General Partner on the publication date.

All investments involve risk including the loss of principal.</p> <p>Performance results shown are for the Hirschmann Partnership LP and are presented net of all fees, including performance allocation, brokerage commissions and other operating expenses of the Fund. Net performance includes the reinvestment of all dividends, interest, and capital gains. The General Partner does not receive any asset-based management fees. For each Class A Limited Partner, the General Partner is allocated a performance allocation equal to 25% of the amount by which the increase in net asset value exceeds a 6% annualized hurdle rate. For each Class B Limited Partner, the General Partner is allocated a performance allocation equal to 33% of the amount by which the increase in net asset value exceeds the S&amp;P 500 Index.</p> <p>In practice, the performance allocation is earned annually or upon a withdrawal from the Fund. Because some investors may have different fee arrangements and depending on the timing of a specific investment, net performance for an individual investor may vary from the net performance as stated herein.</p> <p>This document refers to indices such as the S&amp;P 500. This does not imply that the Fund will have returns, volatility or other characteristics similar to the indices. The Fund's holdings may differ significantly from the indices' underlying securities.
