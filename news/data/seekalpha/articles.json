By sector, health care and materials were the most significant detractors from market returns during the period. By country, Switzerland and France were the largest detractors while Israel and Singapore contributed to market performance.</p> <p><figure class=\"regular-img-figure\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/4/58280443-17386864001745672.png\" alt=\"Performance highlights\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2>PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE</h2> <p>The portfolio’s return was -10.93% (net) for the reporting period. This compares to the MSCI World ex USA Small Cap Index that returned -7.86% for the same period.</p> <h3>Top contributors:</h3> <ul> <li>St. James Place (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STJPF\" title=\"St. James's Place plc\">OTCPK:STJPF</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. After a strong decline from the third quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024 due to regulatory reviews that forced a management fee cut and business fine, the U.K.-headquartered wealth management company’s stock price rose strongly during the second and third quarters of 2024 as management revealed a compelling multi-year strategy to double earnings in the business by 2030. We believe management’s plan is credible based on multiple conversations with competitors, U.K. wealth management advisors and St. James Place senior executives. We continue to see the U.K. wealth management industry as an attractive and growing market and see St. James Place as competitively best positioned to capture a strong share of asset flows. Healthy asset flows combined with a reasonable cost-cutting plan should drive strong earnings growth momentum for St. James Place in the coming years. We believe the stock looks inexpensive on our view of normalized earnings.</li> <li>Julius Baer Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STJPF\" title=\"St. James's Place plc\">OTCPK:STJPF</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. The Switzerland-headquartered private bank’s price rose in November after publishing a four-month trading statement that indicated new net assets grew by 4.2%. This growth is being driven both by contributions from new hires as well as a pick-up in productivity from existing relationship managers. Gross margins also showed signs of stabilizing after declining during the first half of the year. New CEO Stefan Bollinger will join the company on January 9, which is sooner than originally expected. We view this positively and believe he is likely to launch new initiatives to both boost growth and efficiency within Julius Baer. We think the shares remain attractively priced and that financial results should improve due to efforts from the new management as well as a stabilization in the financial impact from interest rate movements.</li> <li>Strauss Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SGLJF\" title=\"Strauss Group Ltd.\">OTCPK:SGLJF</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. The Israel-headquartered food company’s stock price appreciated after reporting improved nine-month results driven by improved margins in the dairy (H&amp;W) segment and progressing recovery of profitability in the Brazil coffee business. These results are evidence that CEO Shai Babad’s transformation strategy is seeing results as the company is doing a solid job of taking cost action, improving organizational agility and pruning non-core portfolio holdings. Strauss also announced the sale of its stake in Sabra, an asset that has struggled to deliver consistent profitability owing to quality issues. The price realized from JV partner Pepsi was attractive relative to current profits as well as long-term potential in our assessment. We appreciate the company's attractive end market exposures, market share positions and self-help potential and believe the investment offers an attractive upside.</li> </ul> <h3>Top detractors:</h3> <ul> <li>SoftwareONE Holding (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SWONF\" title=\"SoftwareONE Holding AG\">OTCPK:SWONF</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The Switzerland-headquartered technology distributor’s stock price declined after the company posted weak third-quarter results, reduced both short-term and mid-term revenue guidance, and announced the appointment of a new CEO. In December, the company also announced a proposed merger with Crayon, which is another leading Microsoft reseller listed in Norway. We are working to evaluate the implications of the proposed merger and will make adjustments to our intrinsic value estimate as needed.</li> <li>Lanxess (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LNXSF\" title=\"LANXESS Aktiengesellschaft\">OTCPK:LNXSF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LNXSY\" title=\"LANXESS Aktiengesellschaft\">OTCPK:LNXSY</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The Germany-headquartered diversified chemicals company’s stock price declined despite posting nine-month earnings results that met our expectations at the group level. Lanxess’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization increased healthily, driven both by improved utilization as well as progress with its efficiency program. The primary negative in the results was the company’s free cash flow, which missed consensus expectations due to a year-over-year negative swing in working capital driven by safety stock build-up related to potential labor action at U.S. ports. While this temporarily reduced cash flow, we believe this was a prudent decision and that medium-term deleveraging will proceed in line with expectations. During the quarter, Lanxess also secured an attractive sale of its non-core Urethanes business for EUR 460 million. We think Lanxess is performing in line with our thesis and that the shares remain undervalued.</li> <li>Wynn Macau (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WYNMF\" title=\"Wynn Macau, Limited\">OTCPK:WYNMF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WYNMY\" title=\"Wynn Macau, Limited\">OTCPK:WYNMY</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The Hong Kong-listed casinos and gaming company’s stock price declined following the release of third-quarter results, which came up short of consensus but were in line with our expectations. The overall Macau gaming sector, including Wynn Macau, experienced weak share price performance in the fourth quarter due to a sequential slowdown in gross gaming revenue and negative China sentiment. However, the recovery post Covid-19 is well underway and Wynn Macau trades at historically low valuation levels. We continue to view the company as a strong operator with a solid long-term growth profile.</li> </ul> <h2>PORTFOLIO POSITIONING</h2> <p>We initiated the following position(s) during the period:</p> <ul> <li>Auction Technologies Group (ATG) is an online marketplace business that connects auctioneers to millions of bidders online in the U.S. and Europe. The company owns the leading marketplaces in its core product categories with an unmatched database of bidders. ATG provides significant value to its auction house partners by enabling them to reach a much wider bidder base than they could on their own, generating more sales and better prices. We believe the company stands to benefit from secular tailwinds that favor e-commerce penetration in auctions, driven by the beneficial economic model of online auctions compared to in-person auctions. The company is also rolling out value-added services across marketing, payments and shipping that, in our view, will increase the value of its platform in the auction ecosystem as well as allow it to increase monetization over time. Recently, a post-Covid-19 normalization in online auction sales coupled with concerns over an increase in churn of larger auction houses to white-label platforms has weighed on the share price. We believe these fears are exaggerated as headwinds from post-Covid-19 normalization will slow and the company’s core customer base of smaller auction houses is dependent on the bidders that ATG’s marketplaces can bring to bear on an auction. As such, we were happy to recently purchase shares at a material discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.</li> <li>Campari is an Italian-based global spirits producer. Its diverse portfolio includes Aperol, Campari, Espolon, Wild Turkey, Grand Marnier, and SKYY. We believe Campari is a strong marketer with a compelling portfolio that is well-positioned to benefit from the growth in cocktail culture. In our view, Campari's geographic mix limits downside and offers upside optionality in China. We also see an opportunity for improved margins and cash flows as Campari leverages decades of route-to-market investments, recent commodity headwinds normalize, and as Campari exits a period of elevated capital expenditure. Investor concerns regarding industry de-stocking and long-term demand have provided us the opportunity to purchase a highly attractive collection of assets in a defensible category with stock-specific opportunities at a 7-year low valuation.</li> <li>Sopra Steria (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPSAF\" title=\"Sopra Steria Group SA\">OTCPK:SPSAF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPPSY\" title=\"Sopra Steria Group SA\">OTCPK:SPPSY</a>) is a leading European IT services company. The IT services industry is a structurally attractive GDP+ market and an interesting way to invest in continued adoption of technology without specific technology risk. Sopra Steria is in the process of high grading its business by diversifying outside of France and by increasing its business mix towards higher-margin and higher growth digital services and consulting work. After disposing of a money-losing software business, the company has an unlevered balance sheet to pursue accretive bolt-on M&amp;A to help them in that transition. The business has a strong track record of healthy organic growth, margin expansion, and has an asset lite business model that generates strong levels of free cash flow. Recent geopolitical uncertainty in France and a post-COVID cyclical slowdown in IT spending have provided the opportunity to invest at a near-trough earnings multiple, despite the company's attractive and improving profile and robust long-term outlook.</li> </ul> <p>We eliminated the following position(s) during the period:</p> <ul> <li>Euronext (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EUXTF\" title=\"Euronext N.V.\">OTCPK:EUXTF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ERNXY\" title=\"Euronext N.V.\">OTCPK:ERNXY</a>)</li> <li>Gildan Activewear (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GIL\" title=\"Gildan Activewear Inc.\">GIL</a>)</li> </ul> <h2>OUTLOOK</h2> <p>As we look forward to 2025, we note that the spread between growth and value remains especially wide relative to history, both in US and international markets. Given this, we believe that it’s an unusually attractive time to be a value investor. This growth-led market environment has afforded us an excellent opportunity to build very well-diversified portfolios in companies trading at significantly lower than average valuations across a variety of industries. We remain optimistic about the positioning, strength and depth of opportunity set as we continue to find high-quality businesses trading at bargain prices.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p><strong>Past performance is no guarantee of future results.</strong> The investment return and principal value of this portfolio and any particular holdings may fluctuate.

By sector, health care and materials detracted the most from market returns while information technology and consumer discretionary were the top contributors. By country, Switzerland and France detracted most from market performance while the U.S. drove nearly all positive momentum.</p> <p><figure class=\"regular-img-figure\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/4/58280443-17386831772062867.png\" alt=\"Performance highlights\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2>PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE</h2> <p>The portfolio’s return was -3.87% (net) for the reporting period. This compares to the MSCI World Index that returned -0.16% for the same period.</p> <h3>Top contributors:</h3> <ul> <li>Alphabet Cl C (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. Despite ongoing litigation with the Department of Justice in its antitrust case, the U.S.- headquartered interactive media and services company’s stock price rose after posting solid third-quarter earnings. In the Search division, the company generated low-teens year-over-year revenue growth and management highlighted that they’re seeing strong user engagement with their new AI Overviews feature. The biggest upside surprise came from the Cloud division, where revenue growth accelerated to 35% and margins reached a record of 17%. This performance was driven by client demand for AI Infrastructure and Generative AI Solutions as well as core Google Cloud Platform (GCP) products. We continue to believe Alphabet is a collection of great businesses that can unlock further value over the long term through its world-class AI capabilities.</li> <li>Capital One Financial (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COF\" title=\"Capital One Financial Corporation\">COF</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. The U.S.-headquartered consumer finance company’s stock price rose after posting good third-quarter results. In our view, the update seemed to be marginally positive on all fronts, with loans and card purchase volumes growing modestly. In addition, an improved credit outlook caused management to release USD 134 million of loss reserves in the quarter, which contributed to earnings per share that exceeded consensus expectations. Furthermore, Capital One’s stock price got a significant boost in November following the U.S. presidential election as investors are optimistic that the financials sector will benefit from looser regulations. Specific to Capital One, the market now appears to believe that there is a greater probability of the merger with Discover closing and that the credit card late fee cap proposed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau seems less likely to be implemented. We appreciate management’s focus on creating long-term value and think the stock offers an attractive upside.</li> <li>Fiserv (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FI\" title=\"Fiserv, Inc.\">FI</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. The U.S.-headquartered transaction and payment processing company’s stock price rose after re- porting solid third-quarter results with reported revenue growing high single digits and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth in the high teens. Fiserv continues to leverage its scale, investment capacity and large distribution network to drive attractive growth. The business has delivered double-digit EPS growth for 38 consecutive quarters and is run by a management team we admire. We believe that Fiserv is well-positioned to benefit from the secular trend toward digital payments and banking and that the risk/reward remains skewed in our favor.</li> </ul> <h3>Top detractors:</h3> <ul> <li>Bayer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAYZF\" title=\"Bayer Aktiengesellschaft\">OTCPK:BAYZF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAYRY\" title=\"Bayer Aktiengesellschaft\">OTCPK:BAYRY</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The Germany-headquartered agriculture and pharma company’s stock price declined following developments in polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) litigation and soft preliminary 2025 guidance. In October, the Washington Supreme Court granted review for the plaintiff’s appeal of Bayer’s first win at appellate court in PCB. Bayer’s appellate win, if enforced, will result in existing cases being retried on different grounds, but the Washington Supreme Court review raises the risk that the win is overturned. We viewed the appellate win as helpful but not a skeleton key to litigation resolution, so the Washington Supreme Court development is only marginal to value. In November, Bayer issued preliminary 2025 guidance indicating that profits would likely decline. The seemingly implied decline in agriculture business profitability was particularly disappointing versus consensus. This was partially driven by temporary regulatory issues that we expect to resolve in the mid-term, and the balance was driven by challenges in the crop protection portfolio. Bayer is now kicking off a deep restructuring of crop protection that we expect to help offset pressures and drive recovery. Overall, despite current headwinds, we believe that new CEO Bill Anderson’s restructuring and organizational change initiatives will unlock improved performance at Bayer and better capitalize on the potential of its well-positioned franchises. We are watching closely for evidence of success as Bill’s strategy enters its second year.</li> <li>Centene (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CNC\" title=\"Centene Corporation\">CNC</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The U.S.-headquartered managed health care company’s stock price declined despite releasing third-quarter results that showed resilient fundamentals in the face of short-term industry pressure. Centene also issued above consensus guidance for 2025 earnings per share (EPS) at its December investor day. We believe the largest driver of the stock price decline in the quarter was investor concern around how legislative changes following the recent U.S. presidential election could impact the company. In our view, this unease is overly discounted into the share price. We see Centene as having significant embedded earnings power that can drive continued EPS growth even with a less accommodative political backdrop. Shares trade at less than 8.5x 2025 EPS guidance, which we think is a compelling valuation for a business that generates healthy returns on capital and operates in a secularly growing industry.</li> <li>IQVIA Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IQV\" title=\"IQVIA Holdings Inc.\">IQV</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The U.S.-headquartered life sciences tools and services company’s stock price declined due to a reduced near-term outlook in its R&amp;D solutions segment primarily related to a program cancellation and the delay of two large clinical trials that will resume in 2025. However, we believe that the headwinds in this part of the business should abate over the course of 2025. We are also encouraged that growth in the technology and analytics solutions segment is recovering as expected. We believe IQVIA stock is cheap at a mid-teens multiple of normal earnings power.</li> </ul> <h2>PORTFOLIO POSITIONING</h2> <p>We initiated the following position(s) during the period:</p> <ul> <li>Capgemini (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAPMF\" title=\"Capgemini SE\">OTCPK:CAPMF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CGEMY\" title=\"Capgemini SE\">OTCPK:CGEMY</a>) is a global IT services company and considered one of the strongest of the European-headquartered players due to its scale and leading digital transformation capabilities. IT services is an attractive sector that enables investment in higher growth technology adoption trends without taking vendor-specific competitive risks. With the increasing importance of technology use to drive corporate productivity, the sector grows GDP+, and the asset lite business model of IT services companies tends to deliver modest annual margin accretion with strong free cash flow conversion. IT services is also a fragmented sector where regular bolt-on acquisitions have tended to create value. The industry is currently facing cyclical demand pressure, and Capgemini also has higher levels of manufacturing sector client exposure that have been a hindrance over the past year. These headwinds will ease, driving stronger results for the business. We believe Capgemini’s current valuation does not give adequate credit to its mid-term prospects.</li> <li>Diageo (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DEO\" title=\"Diageo plc\">DEO</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DGEAF\" title=\"Diageo plc\">OTCPK:DGEAF</a>) is a global producer, distributor and marketer of premium drinks with more than 200 brands and sales in nearly 180 countries. The U.K.-based holding company's portfolio includes leading brands, such as Johnnie Walker, Guinness, Don Julio, Crown Royal, Smirnoff, Baileys, Casamigos and Captain Morgan. As the market leader, Diageo's scale provides meaningful competitive advantages in terms of distribution and marketing, which enables the company to invest more than its peers while still generating superior returns on capital. In addition, we like that the company's portfolio is well diversified by geography and category, which helps mitigate against earnings volatility related to economic cyclicality and shifting consumer preferences. Industry de-stocking and rising agave prices impacting tequila margins have weighed on the share price recently, which provided an attractive re-entry point to invest in this dominant beverage company at a below-average price.</li> <li>Elevance Health (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ELV\" title=\"Elevance Health, Inc.\">ELV</a>) is one of the nation’s largest managed care organizations. We believe managed care is an attractive industry, as health expenditures have historically outpaced GDP, and the short business cycle allows companies to quickly correct underwriting mistakes. More recently, managed care stocks have underperformed the market as the industry is facing headwinds due to mismatches between reimbursement rates and medical costs. We believe this will prove transitory and that changes to pricing and/or plan designs will help realign profit trends over time. While we acknowledge that a return to “normal” profitability will take a few years, we believe the stock is trading at a depressed multiple of depressed earnings and for a significant discount to both the broader market and the companies’ own trading history. With its unmatched scale, diversification across end markets, and track record of disciplined underwriting and capital allocation, we believe that over time, the market will once again recognize Elevance as a high-quality franchise with above average growth characteristics.</li> <li>Sysco Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SYY\" title=\"Sysco Corporation\">SYY</a>) is one of the largest foodservice distribution companies globally. We appreciate that foodservice distribution is a stable industry that has historically grown slightly faster than food spending thanks to a continued secular shift to food away from home, and that scale advantaged companies, like Sysco, benefit from better procurement terms from suppliers and demonstrate high operational efficiency. Recently, growth in Sysco’s largest and most profitable customer segment, independent restaurants, has slowed, but Sysco is increasing headcount and changing compensation incentives in its salesforce, which we think will reinvigorate growth and prove beneficial for long-term shareholders. In our view, Sysco remains a high-quality company with a credible management team, so we were happy to purchase shares at a discount to peers and Sysco’s own historical trading multiple.</li> </ul> <p>We eliminated the following position(s) during the period:</p> <ul> <li>Amazon.com (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>)</li> <li>Samsung Electronics Pfd (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF\" title=\"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\">OTCPK:SSNLF</a>)</li> </ul> <h2>OUTLOOK</h2> <p>As we look forward to 2025, we note that the spread between growth and value remains especially wide relative to history, both in US and international markets. Given this, we believe that it’s an unusually attractive time to be a value investor. This growth-led market environment has afforded us an excellent opportunity to build very well-diversified portfolios in companies trading at significantly lower than average valuations across a variety of industries. We remain optimistic about the positioning, strength and depth of opportunity set as we continue to find high-quality businesses trading at bargain prices.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p><strong>Past performance is no guarantee of future results.</strong> The investment return and principal value of this portfolio and any particular holdings may fluctuate.
