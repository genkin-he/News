By sector, health care and materials were the most significant detractors from market returns during the period. By country, Switzerland and France were the largest detractors while Israel and Singapore contributed to market performance.</p> <p><figure class=\"regular-img-figure\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/2/4/58280443-17386704095826647.png\" alt=\"Performance highlights\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2>PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE</h2> <p>The portfolio’s return was -8.46% (net) for the reporting period. This compares to the MSCI World ex USA Index that returned -7.43% for the same period.</p> <h3>Top contributors:</h3> <ul> <li>Airbus (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EADSF\" title=\"Airbus SE\">OTCPK:EADSF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EADSY\" title=\"Airbus SE\">OTCPK:EADSY</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. The France-headquartered aerospace and defense company’s stock price rose after releasing third-quarter results where order books were up in all divisions. The Airbus Commercial and Helicopters segments made significant year-over-year increases and order intake in the Space segment rose nearly 30%. Demand for the company’s products remains robust and the constraint is its ability to supply. Positively, inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2024 were 11% higher year-over-year. Further positive news came in early December when Airbus announced stronger than anticipated November deliveries. We appreciate management’s efforts to drive production volume growth, which will be a key to helping the company meet increasing demand over time.</li> <li>Fresenius Medical Care (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FMS\" title=\"Fresenius Medical Care AG\">FMS</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FMCQF\" title=\"Fresenius Medical Care AG\">OTCPK:FMCQF</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. The Germany-headquartered health care company’s stock price rose after reporting solid third-quarter results that tracked in line with our expectations and demonstrated ongoing recovery in the business. Fresenius Medical saw volumes improve, with same store sales returning to growth after years of Covid-19-induced decline. Moreover, self-help initiatives under refreshed management are gaining traction in driving margin expansion across both the services and products segments with significant additional room for improvement. We continue to see the new leadership team making the right decisions to drive profitability going forward and believe that Fresenius Medical can further close its performance gap to peers over the mid term.</li> <li>Accor (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACRFF\" title=\"Accor SA\">OTCPK:ACRFF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACCYY\" title=\"Accor SA\">OTCPK:ACCYY</a>) was a contributor during the quarter. The France-headquartered hotel company’s stock price rose after releasing solid third-quarter results where revenue per available room (RevPAR) was resilient, the pace of development improved, and raised profit guidance implies that Accor is converting the top-line performance to bottom-line progression. These results are consistent with two prongs of our thesis: that Accor’s southeast Asia and Middle East footprint should support longer tailed RevPAR growth and that Accor’s newly implemented steering model to differentiate between economy hotels and luxury franchises should enable improved execution. In addition, AccorInvest successfully refinanced its debt and disposed of assets, which brings closer additional capital return to Accor shareholders. We continue to appreciate the company’s asset-light hotel franchising and think that shareholder returns should continue to improve over time.</li> </ul> <h3>Top detractors:</h3> <ul> <li>Bayer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAYZF\" title=\"Bayer Aktiengesellschaft\">OTCPK:BAYZF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAYRY\" title=\"Bayer Aktiengesellschaft\">OTCPK:BAYRY</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The Germany-headquartered agriculture and pharma company’s stock price declined following developments in polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) litigation and soft preliminary 2025 guidance. In October, the Washington Supreme Court granted review for the plaintiff’s appeal of Bayer’s first win at appellate court in PCB. Bayer’s appellate win, if enforced, will result in existing cases being retried on different grounds, but the Washington Supreme Court review raises the risk that the win is overturned. We viewed the appellate win as helpful but not a skeleton key to litigation resolution, so the Washington Supreme Court development is only marginal to value. In November, Bayer issued preliminary 2025 guidance indicating that profits would likely decline. The seemingly implied decline in agriculture business profitability was particularly disappointing versus consensus. This was partially driven by temporary regulatory issues that we expect to resolve in the mid-term, and the balance was driven by challenges in the crop protection portfolio. Bayer is now kicking off a deep restructuring of crop protection that we expect to help offset pressures and drive recovery. Overall, despite current headwinds, we believe that new CEO Bill Anderson’s restructuring and organizational change initiatives will unlock improved performance at Bayer and better capitalize on the potential of its well-positioned franchises. We are watching closely for evidence of success as Bill’s strategy enters its second year.</li> <li>Glencore (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLCNF\" title=\"Glencore plc\">OTCPK:GLCNF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLNCY\" title=\"Glencore plc\">OTCPK:GLNCY</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The Swiss-based and U.K.-listed diversified metals and mining company’s stock price declined despite third-quarter production results that were in line with consensus expectations. In addition, the company reiterated guidance for the year. The stock’s current underperformance can be partially connected to economic sluggishness in China, the largest commodity buyer in the world. Despite this macro challenge, we continue to believe in Glencore’s management team and appreciate its focus on improving its return on invested capital. The company has leading positions in attractive commodities and latent growth potential in its copper portfolio. As macroeconomic headwinds in key markets subside, we think Glencore can leverage its unique asset and business mix to create further value for shareholders.</li> <li>Kering (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PPRUF\" title=\"Kering SA\">OTCPK:PPRUF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PPRUY\" title=\"Kering SA\">OTCPK:PPRUY</a>) was a detractor during the quarter. The France-headquartered luxury goods company reduced 2024 guidance along with third-quarter results as key brand Gucci continued to suffer from low demand for its carryover bags. We are encouraged, however, by the performance of new product launches which should continue to increase the sales mix going forward. We believe Kering is making the proper long-term investments for Gucci and its other brands to capture future growth of the luxury goods market and we continue to see attractive upside in the stock.</li> </ul> <h2>PORTFOLIO POSITIONING</h2> <p>We initiated the following position(s) during the period:</p> <ul><li>KB Financial Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KB\" title=\"KB Financial Group Inc.\">KB</a>) is a leading Korean bank that provides a range of financial products and services, including retail banking, corporate banking, wealth management, and international banking services. Korean banks have a history generating uninspiring returns on equity (ROE) and low payout ratios (POR), and despite recent geopolitical uncertainty, there is broad support for the government's value-up program which aims to address these issues by encouraging better corporate governance, transparency, and improved capital efficiency. As Korea's largest bank, KB Financial possesses the industry's strongest capital position, a renowned low-cost deposit franchise, and leading fee income, which we believe advantageously positions the company to lead the now improving banking industry in both the speed and magnitude of improvements to POR. In addition, we appreciate management's focus on shareholder return because the anticipated growth in dividends and buybacks provides downside protection if the multiple expansion portion of the thesis sputters. Despite this compelling set-up, we were excited to purchase shares at an attractive valuation for a bank commonly acknowledged as the best bank in Korea, per our channel checks.</li></ul> <p>We did not eliminate any positions during the period.</p> <h2>OUTLOOK</h2> <p>As we look forward to 2025, we note that the spread between growth and value remains especially wide relative to history, both in US and international markets. Given this, we believe that it’s an unusually attractive time to be a value investor. This growth-led market environment has afforded us an excellent opportunity to build very well-diversified portfolios in companies trading at significantly lower than average valuations across a variety of industries. We remain optimistic about the positioning, strength and depth of opportunity set as we continue to find high-quality businesses trading at bargain prices.</p> <span class=\"table-responsive\"><span class=\"table-scroll-wrapper\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p><strong>Past performance is no guarantee of future results.</strong> The investment return and principal value of this portfolio and any particular holdings may fluctuate.
