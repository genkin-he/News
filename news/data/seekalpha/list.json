He expressed optimism about achieving positive flows in 2025, supported by improved investment<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> performance and increased gross sales across channels.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company expanded its ETF portfolio to 17 funds, closing the year with $8 billion in ETF AUM. Target date funds led with $16.3 billion in net inflows for the year, its strongest since 2019. New launches included personalized retirement manager and managed lifetime income products.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">A strategic partnership with Aspida was announced, expected to enhance T. Rowe’s insurance asset management offerings, particularly in public and private assets.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CFO Jen Dardis emphasized that Q4 adjusted diluted EPS was $2.12, bringing the full-year EPS to $9.33, up 23% from 2023. Adjusted net revenue for Q4 reached $1.8 billion, contributing to a full-year revenue of nearly $7.2 billion, a 10.1% increase over the prior year.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Head of Global Investments Eric Veiel noted that 54% of funds exceeded peer group medians for the year, with strong performances in U.S. equity research and several sector-specific strategies. However, he acknowledged challenges in mid-cap growth and emerging markets equity performance.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management expects 2025 to show further improvements in net flows, though achieving full-year positive flows remains uncertain. CEO Rob Sharps stated, “Our base-case is that in 2025, we further reduce net outflows and set the stage to return to organic growth.”</li> <li>Operating expenses for 2025 are forecasted to rise 4-6% over 2024 levels, driven by strategic investments and real-estate costs related to the new Baltimore headquarters.</li> <li>The company plans further expansion in ETFs, targeting launches in 2025 and 2026, including strategies like the capital appreciation premium income ETF.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Q4 adjusted net revenue was $1.8 billion, up 16% year-over-year. Investment advisory revenue reached $1.7 billion, supported by higher average AUM and positive flows in fixed income and alternatives.</li> <li>Net outflows for Q4 totaled $19.3 billion, primarily impacted by a large subadvised variable annuity redemption. However, December saw several sizable mandate wins, including $1.4 billion in ETF net flows.</li> <li>Annualized effective fee rate declined to 40.5 basis points due to a shift towards lower-fee products and vehicles.</li> <li>Full-year capital returns to stockholders amounted to over $1.4 billion, including $355 million in share buybacks.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q&amp;A</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li> <strong>Bill Katz, TD Cowen:</strong> Asked about the Aspida partnership and insurance opportunities. CEO Rob Sharps explained that Aspida allows T. Rowe to refine its insurance asset management offerings, particularly in fixed income and private assets, and is expected to yield direct benefits in 2025.</li> <li> <strong>Benjamin Budish, Barclays Capital:</strong> Inquired about fee rate dynamics and trends into 2025. CFO Jen Dardis noted that elevated redemptions in higher-fee mutual funds and growth in lower-fee vehicles like ETFs and institutional accounts have compressed fee rates by 2% in 2024.</li> <li> <strong>Dan Fannon, Jefferies:</strong> Sought clarification on gross sales trends. CEO Sharps emphasized broad-based improvements across channels, making 2024 the best year for gross sales since 2021, with particular strength in retirement date funds and institutional fixed income.</li> <li> <strong>Ken Worthington, JPMorgan:</strong> Questioned the ETF franchise’s impact on customer reach. CEO Sharps explained ETFs are reaching new buyers, particularly ETF-focused advisors, while acknowledging some cannibalization from mutual funds.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts expressed cautious optimism about the company’s ability to reduce outflows and achieve positive flows, particularly in light of improving gross sales. However, concerns over fee compression and equity performance lingered.</li> <li>Management demonstrated confidence in strategic initiatives, frequently referencing momentum in ETFs, retirement date funds, and alternatives. CEO Rob Sharps’ tone reflected optimism about achieving organic growth, but he acknowledged challenges such as market conditions and fee pressures.</li> <li>Compared to the prior quarter, management’s tone was more positive, buoyed by strong December flows and strategic partnerships. Analysts maintained a slightly skeptical tone, probing for clarity on fee trends and competitive positioning.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Net outflows increased from $12.2 billion in Q3 to $19.3 billion in Q4, largely due to a previously disclosed subadvised variable annuity redemption.</li> <li>Gross sales improved notably in Q4, driven by strong December wins across asset classes and channels.</li> <li>Operating expenses guidance for 2025 indicates slower growth compared to the 6-8% range for 2024.</li> <li>Management tone during the Q4 call was more optimistic compared to Q3, reflecting confidence in improved flows and strategic progress.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Fee compression driven by a shift towards lower-fee vehicles and pricing pressures remains a challenge.</li> <li>Equity performance, while improving in some areas, continues to lag in key strategies like mid-cap growth and emerging markets equity.</li> <li>Regulatory and liquidity hurdles could delay broader adoption of private market allocations in target date funds and retirement products.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">T. Rowe Price is making progress in reducing outflows and building momentum in key growth areas like ETFs, target date funds, and insurance asset management. While challenges such as fee compression and uneven equity performance persist, management’s strategic initiatives and optimistic outlook for 2025 signal potential for improved financial and operational performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TROW/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p> </body></html>",
