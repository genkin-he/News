Cloud has been the driver of revenue growth in recent quarters and continued in the fourth quarter, up 16% year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The analysts added that Juniper enters 2025 with improving momentum in the business, but investor focus remains on the close of the acquisition by Hewlett Packard, which remains pending following the DOJ complaint.</p> </body></html>",
