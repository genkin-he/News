The Bloomberg consensus estimate for adj. EPS growth is 8.1%, and cash flow is $15.09B.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company also expects to incur $200M related to Disney Cruise Line pre-opening expenses and record a $300M equity loss due to the purchase accounting of the Star India deconsolidation in 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In Q2, the company expects a modest decline in Disney+ subscribers sequentially, and expects an impact of $100M on sports operating income from college sports and an additional NFL game, and about $50M from exiting the Venu Sports joint venture.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">During Q1, total Disney+ subscribers came in at 124.6M, which included 56.8M domestic users and 67.8M internationally. Total Hulu subscribers were 53.6M.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\" data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">Domestic Disney+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber increased to $7.99 from $7.70, due to higher pricing, partially offset by a higher mix of subscribers to promotional offerings. International Disney+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber increased to $7.19 from $6.78 due to higher pricing and advertising revenue, partially offset by a higher mix of subscribers to promotional offerings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In his initial reaction to the report, Seeking Alpha analyst and leader of the Investing Group \"Cash Flow Club,\" <a class=\"c-link\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-stringify-link=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/jonathan-weber#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews\" href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/jonathan-weber#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jonathan Weber</a>, said, <em>\"</em>Disney delivered a double beat, growing slightly faster than expected. The Disney+ subscriber number declined sequentially, and the same is expected for the current quarter. That being said, other business units performed reasonably well, and management foresees a nice HSD EPS increase for the current year.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Net income for the three months ended December 31 was $2.64B, compared to $2.15B for the same period last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On a per-share basis, the company earned $1.40, beating the average analyst estimate by 9 cents.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Revenue rose 5% to $24.7B and was ahead of expectations by $150M.</p> </body></html>",
