With an initial production capacity of 100,000 vehicles annually, the project is expected to generate around 1,000 new jobs.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In addition, Toyota has announced plans to begin manufacturing batteries for EVs, hybrids, and plug-ins at a $14 billion facility in North Carolina. The plant, set to begin shipping batteries for North American models in April, will create approximately 5,000 jobs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">These moves come as Toyota reported a significant 61% jump in its fiscal third-quarter profit, which rose to 2.19 trillion yen ($14B) from the previous year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">This growth was driven by 12.4 trillion yen ($81B) in sales, up 3% from the same period last year. The company attributed the increase to recovering sales following a production halt earlier this fiscal year due to a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4114353-japan-auto-safety-testing-scandal-toyota-honda-mazda-suzuki-yamaha\">certification issue</a> in Japan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Toyota also revised its full-year profit forecast, now expecting 4.5 trillion yen ($29B) in profit through March 2025, up from its previous projection of 3.6 trillion yen ($24B). However, the revised forecast still falls short of the 4.9 trillion yen ($32B) profit achieved in the previous fiscal year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Toyota credited favorable foreign exchange rates and cost reduction efforts for the positive revision.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19991857-japans-toyota-announces-ev-and-battery-push-in-china-and-u-s-as-its-quarterly-profit-surges\">Press release</a></p> </div> </body></html>",
