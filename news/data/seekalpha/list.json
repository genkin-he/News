            "description": "<html><body><p>Tariffs have been in the spotlight since Donald Trump took office, and any development has prompted swift reaction in equity markets. </p> <p>Trump over the weekend announced 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, starting a trade war as both countries vowed to retaliate<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> with their own duties.

            "description": "<html><body><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The one-month delay of tariffs against Mexico and Canada turnaround highlights the exceptional uncertainty surrounding a trade war that has price reaction and interest rate implications, according to Stefano Pascale, head of equity derivatives strategy at Barclays.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Barclays economists believe<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> that the implementation of 25% tariffs would boost U.S. CPI and PCE inflation by 10-15 basis points on a percentage year-over-year basis and hit GDP by about 25-50 basis points. The Federal Reserve would then face an inflationary economy and could be forced to cut interest rates more aggressively.</span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">“Insofar as the recent events represent one salvo in a trade war, and to the extent that it matters greatly for the Fed reaction, this debate will remain crucial for equity markets,” said Pascale.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">Markets expectations around Federal Reserve cuts did not change much in the past few days, but if the Fed is forced to aggressively reduce rates in response to lower growth, “small caps could actually outperform on an equity sell-off.”</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">If this were to happen, analysts said, they recommend investors to buy S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SPX</a>) puts “partly funded by selling Russell 2000 (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RTY\" title=\"Russell 2000 Index\">RTY</a></span></span>) puts.”</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">“To hedge such a potential scenario, we would consider buying S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SPX</a>) June 25 6150 puts (ref. 5994.57, 51-delta) and selling 0.7x Russell 2000 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RTY\" title=\"Russell 2000 Index\">RTY</a>) June 25 2300 puts (ref. 2258.42, 49-delta) for zero at inception.”</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">“At current costs, the historical return would have been favorable, especially in the wings (average gains greater than 90<sup>th</sup> percentile of 8.7% is 1.5x larger than the average loss greater than 95th percentile of -6.0%).”</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">To conclude, Pascale said that a trade war would be more damaging to internationally exposed companies. Lower interest rates would also be more beneficial to small caps (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWM\" title=\"iShares Russell 2000 ETF\">IWM</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RTY\" title=\"Russell 2000 Index\">RTY</a>).</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">Lastly, CTAs (commodity trading advisors) positioning on the Russell 2000 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RTY\" title=\"Russell 2000 Index\">RTY</a>) is currently the most short, while S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SP500</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SPX</a>) exposure is higher.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">“The RTY vs. S&amp;P volatility spread has compressed materially over the past month, but remains historically high; notably, the onset of the trade war during Trump 1.0 marked a regime shift lower in the spread from levels comparable to present,” he said.</p> </body></html>",

For Q1, the company projects revenue between $858M and $862M, surpassing the consensus of $810.81M, and adjusted income from operations between $354M and $358M.
