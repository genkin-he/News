He highlighted an improvement<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> in net interest margin (</span><a class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\" href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NIM\" title=\"Nuveen Select Maturities Municipal Fund\">NIM</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">), which increased by 8 basis points due to reduced deposit costs.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Johnny Lee, newly appointed CEO of Royal Business Bank, emphasized the bank's continued focus on resolving non-performing loans (NPLs), the majority of which originated before 2022. He expressed confidence in resuming loan growth in upcoming quarters, supported by a healthy lending pipeline.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Lynn Hopkins, CFO, detailed that the provision for credit losses increased to $6 million in Q4, primarily due to specific reserves for the C&amp;D loan and partial charge-offs on loans held for sale. She highlighted stability in non-interest income but noted a slight rise in non-interest expenses due to higher legal and professional fees.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management expects loan growth to resume in 2025, supported by a strong $200-$225 million lending pipeline. They reiterated their focus on maintaining credit quality while selectively pursuing opportunities.</li> <li>The bank plans to potentially reintroduce a stock buyback program in 2025, while continuing to prioritize addressing credit challenges.</li> <li>The timeline to resolve legacy credit issues has been extended to late 2025, reflecting the addition of significant NPLs in Q4.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Net income declined from $7 million in Q3 to $4.4 million in Q4, primarily due to an increase in NPLs and credit provisions.</li> <li>The NIM improved to 2.76%, an increase of 8 basis points, driven by a decline in deposit costs.</li> <li>Loan balances declined by $28 million due to elevated paydowns, although $126 million in loan production was achieved during the quarter. Non-interest-bearing deposits increased by $20 million.</li> <li>Non-performing loans rose to $81 million or 2% of total assets, with the increase largely driven by the $26 million C&amp;D loan migrating to non-accrual status.</li> <li>Non-interest expenses were stable at $17.6 million but included higher legal and professional costs due to year-end accruals.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q&amp;A</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Brendan Nosal, Hovde Group, asked about the $26 million C&amp;D loan. CFO Lynn Hopkins explained that the project was over 50% complete and required a $4.5 million specific reserve to align with fair value.</li> <li>Matthew Clark, Piper Sandler, inquired about the loan growth pipeline and margin outlook. CEO Johnny Lee highlighted a healthy pipeline averaging $200-$225 million and noted flexibility in pricing for high-quality credits to secure long-term relationships.</li> <li>Kelly Motta, KBW, asked about the construction loan portfolio and credit risk mitigation. Management emphasized that legacy loans originated during COVID faced unique challenges, including material and labor shortages, and assured that proactive measures were being taken.</li> <li>Tim Coffey, Janney, sought clarity on loan payoff mitigation strategies. Management stated they engage in early communication with borrowers and retention efforts to minimize payoffs, although elevated interest costs led some borrowers to utilize excess funds for repayments.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts expressed concerns over the rising NPLs and credit provisions, with questions focusing on credit risk management and the timeline for resolution. Their tone was cautious but constructive.</li> <li>Management maintained a confident tone during the prepared remarks but was more defensive in Q&amp;A, particularly when addressing credit challenges. Key phrases, such as \"we feel comfortable\" and \"we have a good handle,\" reflected efforts to reassure stakeholders.</li> <li>Compared to the previous quarter, the tone was slightly more cautious, reflecting the extended timeline for credit resolution and the impact of NPLs on profitability.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Net income declined from $7 million in Q3 to $4.4 million in Q4, with the drop attributed to higher credit provisions and NPLs.</li> <li>Loan production decreased from $175 million in Q3 to $126 million in Q4, while loan balances declined compared to growth in the prior quarter.</li> <li>The NIM improved in Q4, reversing the minimal 1 basis point increase in Q3, supported by falling deposit costs.</li> <li>Management's tone shifted slightly, with increased emphasis on resolving credit challenges and extending the timeline for addressing legacy issues.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Rising NPLs, particularly in the construction loan portfolio, pose a significant risk, with management attributing some issues to projects originated during COVID.</li> <li>Elevated paydowns and aggressive refinancing offers from competitors continue to challenge loan growth.</li> <li>Higher legal and professional expenses related to credit resolution efforts may persist in 2025, impacting non-interest expenses.</li> <li>Analysts raised concerns about the bank's ability to balance credit resolution with growth initiatives.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">RBB Bancorp's Q4 2024 earnings call highlighted the bank's efforts to address rising non-performing loans while maintaining a healthy lending pipeline. Management expressed confidence in resuming loan growth in 2025, supported by strong production prospects and selective credit strategies. However, challenges persist, including elevated credit provisions, declining net income, and an extended timeline for resolving legacy credit issues. Investors may closely monitor the bank's progress on mitigating credit risks and achieving its growth targets in the coming quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RBB/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p> </body></html>",
