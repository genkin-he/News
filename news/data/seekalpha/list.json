Annual investment at the same time rose 25% to reach a four-year high of 1,180t.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The LBMA gold price reached 40 record highs during 2024. The combination of record gold prices and volumes produced a Q4 value of $111 billion, taking 2024 over the line to reach the highest-ever annual value of $382 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Gold ETFs had a sizable impact:</strong> 2024 marked the first year since 2020 in which holdings were essentially unchanged, in contrast to the heavy outflows of the prior three years, the WGC said.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For 2025, the WGC said central banks and \"ETF investors likely to drive demand with economic uncertainty supporting gold’s role as a risk hedge, but on the flipside, keeping pressure on jewellery.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As such, demand in top bullion consumers, India and China, is likely to remain robust but slightly weaker than 2024, as growth slows in India and equity and real estate markets recover somewhat in China offering alternatives to domestic investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Spot gold prices (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAUUSD:CUR\" title=\"Gold Spot Price\">XAUUSD:CUR</a></span>) were trading <span class=\"green\">+1.06% higher at $2,870.87</span> an ounce on Wednesday, hovering <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4401660-incredible-demand-for-physical-gold-adding-to-already-tight-market-analyst-says\">near record levels.</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ETFs: (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSEARCA:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLD\" title=\"SPDR® Gold Shares ETF\">GLD</a></span>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GDX\" title=\"VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF\">GDX</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GDXJ\" title=\"VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF\">GDXJ</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IAU\" title=\"iShares Gold Trust ETF\">IAU</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NUGT\" title=\"Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 2x Shares ETF\">NUGT</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PHYS\" title=\"Sprott Physical Gold Trust\">PHYS</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLDM\" title=\"World Gold Trust - SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust\">GLDM</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAAU\" title=\"Goldman Sachs Physical Gold ETF\">AAAU</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SGOL\" title=\"Aberdeen Standard Physical Gold Shares ETF\">SGOL</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RING\" title=\"iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners ETF\">RING</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAR\" title=\"GraniteShares Gold Trust\">BAR</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OUNZ\" title=\"VanEck Merk Gold Trust\">OUNZ</a>), (NYSEARCA:SLV), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSLV\" title=\"Sprott Physical Silver Trust\">PSLV</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SIVR\" title=\"Aberdeen Standard Physical Silver Shares ETF\">SIVR</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SIL\" title=\"Global X Silver Miners ETF\">SIL</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SILJ\" title=\"ETFMG Prime Junior Silver Miners ETF\">SILJ</a>)</p> </body></html>",
