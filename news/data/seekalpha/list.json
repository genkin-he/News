The first quarter revenue is expected to be down 9% quarter-overquarter, lower than consensus, which likely reflects continued macro weakness in Europe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The analysts noted that the Dutch company's first quarter revenue is expected to be $2.83B at the midpoint, below KeyBanc's estimate of $2.90B and the consensus of $2.89B.
