Discovery (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBD\" title=\"Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.\">WBD</a>), and Disney (<a class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\" href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">) for sports streaming fell apart.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">During the earnings call, he clarified that the service would not incur incremental rights costs and would be priced modestly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The subscription streaming service is expected to include content from Fox News and Fox Sports.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Murdoch did not elaborate further about the service or its pricing strategy. He said expectations for subscriber numbers \"would be modest.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The service by Fox comes at a time when live sports and event streaming are on the rise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Lachlan Murdoch on Fox's Q2 earnings call said, \"We see the traditional cable bundle as, still, the most value for our customers and frankly the most value for the company. So we are huge supporters of the traditional cable bundle and will always be. But that said, we do want to reach consumers wherever they are, and there is now a large population outside the traditional cable bundle, either cord-cutters or cord-nevers. And we are designing… an offering to really target those cord-cutters and cord-nevers that are not traditionally in the cable bundle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">“We do not want, and we have no intention of turning a traditional distribution customer into a DTC customer. So our subscriber expectations will be modest, and we are going to price the service accordingly.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">“With these modest expectations, we do not expect any exclusive rights costs or additional incremental rights costs. This service will be a package of our existing content and existing brands targeted to consumers who are not currently in the bundle. So the incremental cost will be relatively low, certainly relative to what our peers… are spending in the space.”</p> </body></html>",

Total segment operating profit for Q4 reached $1.1B, with<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> full-year operating profit at $4.2B.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Luciano emphasized operational improvements, such as record crush volumes in LATAM and enhanced performance in Starches &amp; Sweeteners, which achieved 3% higher production year-over-year. Two flavors acquisitions were successfully integrated, contributing to the EMEA region's performance.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ADM announced targeted cost reductions of $500M to $750M over the next three to five years, including $200M to $300M planned for 2025.

The AS&amp;O segment operating profit declined by 32% year-over-year.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management expects a challenging first-half of 2025, with significantly lower soybean and canola crush margins.

For the full year, AS&amp;O segment performance is anticipated to be \"below to similar\" to 2024 levels.</li> <li>Nutrition segment operating profits are forecasted to improve in 2025, driven by stronger performance in Flavors and Animal Nutrition, alongside cost optimization.

Revenues for the quarter were not explicitly mentioned in the transcript.</li> <li>The AS&amp;O segment reported a Q4 operating profit of $644M, down 32% year-over-year, driven by weaker crush margins and higher costs. Full-year operating profit for the segment fell 40% compared to 2023.</li> <li>Carbohydrate Solutions' Q4 operating profit was flat year-over-year, supported by robust demand for ethanol and strong North American starches and sweeteners margins, partially offset by weaker EMEA results.</li> <li>Nutrition achieved Q4 operating profit of $88M, supported by improved mix and insurance recoveries. However, organic revenues in the segment declined due to demand challenges and higher manufacturing costs.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q&amp;A</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Tom Palmer, Citi: Questioned the expected recovery in nutrition profits in 2025. CEO Luciano explained that improvements would stem from the Decatur East facility resuming operations, strong growth in Flavors and Biotics, and margin improvements in Animal Nutrition.</li> <li>Andrew Strelzik, BMO: Asked about vegetable oil demand post-45Z guidance. Luciano noted expectations of a 5% increase in soybean oil's share of feedstock while emphasizing policy clarity's importance for stabilizing margins.</li> <li>Ben Theurer, Barclays: Sought clarification on the AS&amp;O segment’s expected Q1 decline. CFO Patolawala cited lower crush margins and reduced insurance proceeds but highlighted operational efficiencies expected to improve results later in the year.</li> <li>Heather Jones, Heather Jones Research: Inquired about potential cost recoveries in 2025. Patolawala estimated insurance proceeds would range between $50M to $100M in 2025 from the Decatur East incident.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts expressed concerns over weak Q1 projections and the impact of policy uncertainties, highlighting skepticism about margin recoveries and operational headwinds.</li> <li>Management maintained a cautiously optimistic tone, emphasizing internal cost controls, portfolio simplification, and operational improvements as key levers for navigating a challenging environment.</li> <li>Compared to the previous quarter, management displayed consistent confidence in addressing operational inefficiencies, while analysts remained focused on unresolved headwinds and policy-related risks.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Guidance for adjusted EPS was narrowed to $4.00-$4.75 for 2025, reflecting a more conservative outlook compared to the $4.50-$5.00 guidance from Q3 2024.</li> <li>Management’s focus shifted towards identifying $2B in portfolio opportunities, a new strategic initiative not emphasized in the prior quarter.</li> <li>The tone during Q4 was slightly more defensive, with management highlighting uncertainties in biofuel policies and trade environments compared to the broader optimism expressed in Q3.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Trade policy uncertainties with China and Canada could impact crush margins and export volumes.</li> <li>Regulatory ambiguities surrounding biofuel policies, including the 45Z guidance, add volatility to soybean oil demand.</li> <li>Ongoing operational challenges at the Decatur East facility continue to weigh on the Nutrition segment.</li> <li>Lower insurance recoveries in 2025 and cost pressures from inflation and manufacturing inefficiencies pose additional risks.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ADM is navigating a challenging operating environment with a focus on cost management, operational improvements, and strategic portfolio simplification.

EBIT in Reinforcement Materials grew 1%, while Performance Chemicals saw a 32% rise due<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> to higher volumes and demand stabilization.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company generated $124 million in operating cash flow, with $77 million invested in growth projects, including new capacity in Indonesia for Reinforcement Materials and battery materials in China. $66 million was returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CFO Erica McLaughlin highlighted a strong liquidity position of $1.3 billion and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.3x. Capital expenditures for FY2025 are expected to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Keohane reaffirmed Cabot’s long-term growth strategy centered on the \"Creating for Tomorrow\" pillars of grow, innovate, and optimize, targeting an adjusted EPS CAGR of 7%-10% over the next three years.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management reaffirmed FY2025 adjusted EPS guidance of $7.40 to $7.80, supported by stable Reinforcement Materials EBIT and growth in Performance Chemicals. Performance Chemicals is expected to maintain quarterly EBIT in the $45 million to $55 million range.</li> <li>Demand for infrastructure-related products, especially in wind energy and power distribution cables, is projected to drive growth, while auto-related sales are expected to align with flat global tire production levels.</li> <li>The company anticipates a gradual ramp-up of its Indonesia Reinforcement Materials capacity in the latter half of FY2025, with significant contributions expected in FY2026.</li> <li>Tariffs on US-Mexico-China trade are being assessed. The direct impact is expected to be minimal, but downstream effects on demand remain under evaluation.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Adjusted EPS for Q1 2025 was $1.76, up from $1.56 in Q1 2024, driven by EBIT growth in both business segments.</li> <li>Reinforcement Materials reported EBIT of $130 million, benefiting from higher volumes and favorable pricing but offset by a less favorable geographic mix and lower energy center revenue. Performance Chemicals’ EBIT improved by $11 million year-over-year, supported by an 8% volume increase.</li> <li>Total operating cash flow was $124 million, with discretionary free cash flow at $114 million. Shareholder returns included $24 million in dividends and $42 million in share repurchases.</li> <li>The operating tax rate for Q1 2025 was 28%, with the full-year tax rate expected to range between 27%-29%.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q&amp;A</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Chris Perrella, UBS: Asked about Reinforcement Materials contract terms and volumes. CEO Keohane explained base prices remained flat year-over-year, with volume increases in Europe offset by challenges in the Americas due to Asian tire imports. He noted modest EBIT gains in H2 2025 from Indonesia capacity.</li> <li>John Roberts, Mizuho: Inquired about the impact of rising oil prices on specialty blacks. Keohane indicated adjustments in spot pricing to maintain margins while emphasizing the company’s track record of margin management.</li> <li>Lydia Huang, J.P. Morgan: Queried drivers of Performance Chemicals’ 8% volume growth. CFO McLaughlin attributed growth primarily to fumed metal oxide products, which saw a 20% increase, and carbons and compounds, which grew by 5%-6%.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts expressed cautious optimism, focusing on global demand shifts, margin management, and tariff impacts. Concerns centered on competitive pressures in the Americas and the outlook for tire production.</li> <li>Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, emphasizing strategic execution and growth opportunities. However, during Q&amp;A, responses were more defensive, addressing challenges in Reinforcement Materials and trade dynamics.</li> <li>Compared to Q4 2024, both management and analysts displayed consistent confidence in long-term strategies, with analysts slightly more pressing on near-term risks.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Reinforcement Materials EBIT remained stable, but the Q1 2025 outlook included modest sequential improvement from seasonally higher volumes in Europe, contrasting with Q4 2024’s lower volumes.</li> <li>Performance Chemicals continued its recovery, with EBIT growth driven by demand stabilization and higher-margin applications. Q1 2025 results were stronger than Q4 2024, which had higher maintenance costs.</li> <li>Management's tone reflected continued confidence in strategic execution. Analysts maintained focus on competitive dynamics and cost pressures, similar to prior discussions.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Challenges include the impact of Asian tire imports on North American volumes, potential downstream effects from new tariffs, and competitive pressures in Reinforcement Materials.</li> <li>Management emphasized operational excellence and geographic diversification as mitigation strategies. The company also expects minimal direct impacts from tariffs due to existing agreements allowing cost pass-throughs.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Cabot Corporation delivered strong Q1 2025 results, with a 13% adjusted EPS growth and significant EBIT gains in Performance Chemicals. The company reaffirmed its FY2025 EPS guidance of $7.40 to $7.80, supported by infrastructure-driven demand and operational efficiencies. While competitive pressures and trade dynamics pose challenges, Cabot remains confident in its long-term strategy, underpinned by disciplined capital allocation and targeted capacity expansions in Indonesia and battery materials.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CBT/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p> </body></html>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ATKR\" title=\"Atkore Inc.\">ATKR</a></span>) Q1 2025</p> <h3>Management View</h3> <ul> <li>CEO Bill Waltz highlighted that Q1 performance met expectations with net sales of $662 million and adjusted EBITDA of $99 million. Adjusted EPS reached $1.63, near the top end of their guidance range. Organic volume declined<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> 5% due to tough year-over-year comparisons.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Waltz noted the company remains on track with growth initiatives related to water and global construction services, with planned contributions later in the year to support PVC and HDPE water products. He emphasized a focus on mitigating pricing pressures and advancing strategic initiatives to expand into new markets.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Management reduced their full-year adjusted EBITDA outlook to a midpoint of $400 million, down from previous estimates, citing larger-than-anticipated impacts from competitive pricing pressures in PVC and steel conduit markets.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CFO John Deitzer provided additional insights, stating that average selling prices decreased by 12% in Q1, primarily driven by PVC and steel conduit products, and outlined steps to manage costs and improve operational efficiency.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management provided Q2 guidance with net sales expected between $685 million and $715 million, adjusted EBITDA of $85 million to $95 million, and adjusted EPS of $1.30 to $1.50. For FY 2025, full-year adjusted EBITDA is projected in the range of $375 million to $425 million, with adjusted EPS between $5.75 and $6.85.</li> <li>Waltz mentioned that the company expects a stronger performance in the second half of FY 2025 due to seasonal construction activity and ramping up of growth initiatives. The guidance assumes no material benefit from tariffs on imported conduit but acknowledges potential upside if tariffs are enacted.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Q1 net sales reached $662 million, with adjusted EBITDA of $99 million and a tax rate of 21%, up from 17.5% in the prior year. Organic volumes declined 5%, and average selling prices fell by 12%, driven primarily by PVC and steel conduit pricing pressures.</li> <li>Metal framing, cable management, and construction services grew mid-single digits, supported by global mega projects. In contrast, plastic pipe and conduit volumes declined mid-single digits, reflecting increased import competition and tough prior-year comparisons.</li> <li>Management highlighted improvements in operational performance at facilities such as Hobart, Indiana, which supported sequential margin gains within the S&amp;I segment.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q&amp;A</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Andy Kaplowitz, Citigroup, questioned the impact of PVC import competition and sought clarity on the dynamics affecting metal conduit volumes. Bill Waltz explained that PVC imports grew over 20% year-over-year and emphasized that the pricing pressures are factored into the revised guidance, which assumes market normalization to pre-COVID levels by year-end.</li> <li>Deane Dray, RBC, inquired about the drivers of the guidance cut and the contribution of PVC versus steel. CFO Deitzer clarified that approximately 75% of the pricing impact comes from PVC, with the remainder from steel conduit. Waltz added that additional domestic PVC capacity and imports have further pressured prices.</li> <li>Chris Moore, CJS Securities, asked about the fiscal 2025 bottoming outlook. Waltz highlighted ongoing productivity improvements, growth in water-related products, and contributions from global mega projects as key drivers for recovery.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts displayed a slightly negative tone, focusing on pricing pressures and the competitive landscape, particularly in PVC and steel conduit markets. Concerns centered around the company's ability to navigate these headwinds and deliver on revised guidance.</li> <li>Management adopted a cautiously optimistic tone, emphasizing operational improvements and growth initiatives. Waltz expressed confidence in the company's ability to manage challenges, stating, \"We remain committed to executing our strategy to deliver value for shareholders.\"</li> <li>Compared to the previous quarter, sentiment has shifted slightly more negative, reflecting increased competitive pressures and lowered guidance.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Guidance was revised downward, with FY 2025 adjusted EBITDA projections reduced to a midpoint of $400 million from $500 million previously forecasted. This reflects a more cautious outlook on pricing dynamics in PVC and steel conduit markets.</li> <li>Analysts' focus shifted from general growth opportunities to concerns about competitive pressures and pricing sustainability.</li> <li>Management's tone was slightly less confident compared to Q4 2024, with a greater emphasis on mitigating risks and cost management.</li> <li>Growth initiatives such as water-related products and global mega projects remained key strategic priorities, consistent with earlier quarters.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Competitive pricing pressures in PVC and steel conduit markets were highlighted as significant challenges. Waltz cited increased imports and new domestic capacity as key factors.</li> <li>Analysts raised concerns about the ability of the company to stabilize pricing and sustain profitability amid these headwinds.</li> <li>Management outlined mitigation strategies, including cost structure optimization, productivity improvements, and advancing growth initiatives in water and construction services.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Atkore's Q1 2025 results met expectations, but competitive pressures in PVC and steel conduit markets prompted a downward revision to full-year guidance. Management remains focused on advancing growth initiatives in water-related products and global mega projects while navigating pricing headwinds. Analysts raised concerns about the ability to sustain profitability, but management highlighted productivity improvements and strategic investments as key drivers for recovery in the second half of the fiscal year and beyond.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ATKR/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p> </body></html>",

On the buyback front, Disney also set a target of $3 billion for the fiscal year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Even though, analysts are positive on Disney’s Entertainment unit, many are focusing on the company’s Experiences segment, given the impact from hurricanes Helene and Milton and cruise ship pre-opening costs. The company also faced a slowdown in attendance after a post-covid surge.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">BofA analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich said he projects Q1 to be “the trough quarter of this fiscal year,” adding that it does not appear the recent Los Angeles fires have had a material impact on Disneyland attendance until now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">“We project a mid-single digit decline in F1Q25 (-5%) weighed down by Hurricane impacts and pre-opening costs for the Disney Treasure, improving to +4% in F2Q and full year growth of 7%,” noted Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris, while talking about the Experiences segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Disney Treasure is a cruise ship that began its maiden voyage in December last year. Disney cruises are part of the company’s experiences division, alongside theme parks, resorts and consumer products. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Over the last two years, Disney <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS/earnings/eps-surprise-summary\">has beaten EPS estimates</a> 88% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 50% of the time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Wall Street and Seeking Alpha analysts are <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS/ratings/quant-ratings#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews\">bullish</a> and recommended the company as a Buy, while Seeking Alpha’s Quant Ratings rated it as a Hold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Over the last three months, EPS estimates have seen 13 <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS/earnings/revisions\">upward revisions</a> compared to three downward revisions. Revenue estimates have been revised upward six times versus seven downward moves.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company’s stock has gained 18% in the last one year, compared to the over 20% rise in the broader S&amp;P500 Index.</p> </body></html>",
