He noted that production has<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> resumed following the resolution of component shortages.</span></p></li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>CFO Tony Voorhees reported total revenue of $113.9 million, a decline from $147.8 million in Q2 fiscal 2024. He attributed the revenue drop to specific customer issues and seasonal production challenges. Gross margins fell to 6.8%, while operating margins turned negative at (1%) due to the revenue shortfall.</p></li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>The company secured new programs in aerospace systems and energy resiliency technology, with one program expected to generate annual revenue exceeding $60 million once fully ramped by the latter half of 2025. Management also emphasized strategic expansions in Arkansas and Vietnam to address customer demand for onshoring and mitigate potential tariff impacts.</p></li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>CFO Voorhees highlighted a $1 million interest expense write-off related to debt refinancing and introduced a new $115 million asset-based financing agreement, improving liquidity for long-term growth.</p></li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>CEO Larsen stated, \"We are significantly increasing our production capacity in Arkansas and Vietnam\" to address geopolitical and tariff-related uncertainties while preparing for future growth opportunities.</p></li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li><p>Management expects revenue and earnings to recover in Q3 fiscal 2025 as strategic initiatives take effect, including operational adjustments and enhancing production efficiency. However, the company declined to issue specific revenue or earnings guidance for Q3 fiscal 2025, citing uncertainties around new tariffs and customer demand shifts.</p></li> <li><p>CEO Larsen confirmed continued investment in Vietnam and U.S. facilities to meet rising customer interest, particularly for nearshoring contract manufacturing.</p></li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li><p>Q2 fiscal 2025 reported a net loss of $4.9 million or ($0.46) per share, compared to a net income of $1.1 million or $0.10 per share in Q2 fiscal 2024. Adjusted net loss was $4.1 million or ($0.38) per share.</p></li> <li><p>Inventory levels were reduced by $23 million or 19% year-over-year, reflecting improved supply chain conditions and customer demand planning. Total liabilities decreased by $38 million or 15%, contributing to a stronger current ratio of 2.8 compared to 2.6 a year ago.</p></li> <li><p>Capital expenditures totaled $800,000 for Q2 fiscal 2025, with full-year CapEx expected to range between $8 million and $10 million.

CEO Larsen confirmed the aerospace program starts as a $5 million opportunity with growth potential, while the energy resiliency project is expected to ramp up later in 2025.</p></li> <li><p>George Melas, MKH Management: Inquired about inventory trends. CFO Voorhees attributed the Q2 inventory increase to delayed shipments caused by component shortages but expects inventory turns to improve with higher revenue in the second half of fiscal 2025.</p></li> <li><p>Dezellem questioned the impact of new tariffs on customer sentiment. CEO Larsen acknowledged customer concerns over cost unpredictability, leading to increased interest in U.S. and Vietnam manufacturing as alternatives to Mexico.</p></li> <li><p>Melas asked about the gross margin drop. CFO Voorhees explained that fixed production costs and lower revenue significantly impacted margins but noted ongoing efforts to improve operating efficiencies.</p></li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li><p>Analysts expressed concerns over revenue shortfalls, margin compression, and tariff uncertainties. Questions frequently focused on customer demand, inventory management, and the sustainability of new program wins. The tone was cautious but showed optimism around new business opportunities.</p></li> <li><p>Management remained cautiously optimistic, emphasizing strategic initiatives to address operational inefficiencies and diversify production capabilities. CEO Larsen confidently outlined growth plans, stating, \"We believe these initiatives will contribute to profitable long-term growth.\"</p></li> <li><p>Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone was less upbeat due to unexpected challenges but demonstrated resilience in presenting recovery strategies. Analysts' tone showed increased skepticism over tariff-related risks.</p></li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li><p>Revenue declined from $131.6 million in Q1 fiscal 2025 to $113.9 million in Q2 fiscal 2025, driven by unexpected component shortages and reduced demand. Gross margins dropped from 10.1% to 6.8%.</p></li> <li><p>Strategic focus shifted more heavily toward mitigating geopolitical risks with expanded U.S. and Vietnam production.</p></li> <li><p>Analyst concerns evolved from Q1's focus on customer-driven delays to broader issues in Q2, such as tariffs and fixed cost challenges.</p></li> <li><p>Management confidence in new programs and operational improvements remained strong, although tempered by Q2's revenue and margin setbacks.</p></li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li><p>Tariff uncertainties on goods from China and Mexico pose significant risks to cost and margin predictability. Management is mitigating these risks by expanding U.S. and Vietnam operations.</p></li> <li><p>Component shortages and fluctuating customer demand continue to challenge revenue consistency.</p></li> <li><p>Fixed production costs limit short-term flexibility to adjust margins during revenue fluctuations.</p></li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Management is focused on addressing operational inefficiencies and diversifying production to mitigate geopolitical and tariff-related risks. While Q2 fiscal 2025 results were impacted by component shortages and reduced demand, the company remains optimistic about growth opportunities through new program wins and expanded production capacity in Arkansas and Vietnam. These strategic initiatives aim to position Key Tronic for long-term profitability and resilience against external uncertainties.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KTCC/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p> </body></html>",
