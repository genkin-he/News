            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Nokian Renkaat Oyj (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NKRKF\" title=\"Nokian Renkaat Oyj\">OTCPK:NKRKF</a>) Q4 2024</p> <h3>Management View</h3> <ul> <li>President and CEO Paolo Pompei highlighted a \"solid growth driven by Central Europe\" in 2024 and acknowledged challenges in North America, where performance remained soft in Q4. He emphasized the strategic importance of<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> the new Romania factory, which is expected to drive future growth and contribute to the company’s manufacturing agility.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Pompei outlined key priorities for 2025, including ramping up Romania’s production, increasing efficiency and productivity, and expanding market penetration in Central Europe and North America. He noted the company's focus on high-value segments, particularly winter and all-season tires, and plans to leverage the new manufacturing platform for operational excellence.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CFO Niko Haavisto reported that net sales increased by over 13% in Q4, driven mainly by Central Europe. However, the operating profit declined due to lower average selling prices and higher operating expenses. He stated a segment EBITDA of €67 million for the quarter.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management expects net sales and segment operating profit as a percentage of net sales to grow in 2025 compared to 2024. This guidance assumes a ramp-up of the Romania factory, improved operational efficiency, and continued market expansion efforts.</li> <li>The company plans to introduce several new products in 2025 to strengthen its position in key markets, including Central Europe and North America.</li> <li>Pompei disclosed that Romania’s factory would significantly contribute to global manufacturing volumes in 2025, with the company awaiting final permits to begin commercial deliveries.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Net sales grew by over 13% in Q4, primarily due to strong performance in Central Europe. Segment operating profit decreased, impacted by a less favorable product mix and increased operating expenses.</li> <li>The company reported a segment EBITDA of €185 million for the year, with a margin of 14.4%. The full-year net sales reached €1.3 billion, reflecting over 10.5% growth in comparable currencies.</li> <li>Heavy tires performed well, achieving a 14% operating profit margin in Q4 despite a weak market. The Vianor segment also saw solid sales but faced margin pressures.</li> <li>The board proposed a dividend of €0.25 per share, to be paid in a single installment in May 2025.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q&amp;A</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Akshat Kacker, JPMorgan: Asked about the dividend policy and whether a second dividend payment could occur later in 2025. CFO Haavisto confirmed that €0.25 per share is the final proposal for 2025.</li> <li>Thomas Besson, Kepler Cheuvreux: Inquired about the impact of contract manufacturing on operating profit and the margin outlook for 2025. CEO Pompei explained that contract manufacturing supports summer tire sales but affects the product mix. Haavisto suggested that segment exclusions are expected to decrease significantly in 2025.</li> <li>Miika Ihamaki, DNB Markets: Questioned the drivers behind 2025 guidance. Haavisto highlighted improved factory efficiency, better raw material procurement, and a focus on operating cost management as key elements.</li> <li>Artem Beletski, SEB: Asked about the Romania factory’s production targets and one-off costs. Pompei indicated that the factory would contribute significantly to volumes in 2025, while Haavisto estimated CapEx at €200 million for the year.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts raised concerns about margin pressures and one-off costs related to the Romania factory ramp-up. Their tone was generally neutral to slightly skeptical, particularly regarding North American performance and pricing dynamics.</li> <li>Management maintained a cautiously optimistic outlook, emphasizing operational improvements and growth prospects. Pompei expressed confidence in the company's strategic direction and highlighted its competitive advantages in high-value segments.</li> <li>Compared to the previous quarter, analysts were more focused on the company’s ability to execute its ramp-up plans and improve margins. Management’s tone was consistent, with a focus on addressing challenges and leveraging new opportunities.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Guidance language shifted to reflect specific growth expectations for 2025, with a focus on improved profitability and market expansion.</li> <li>The strategic focus evolved, with greater emphasis on ramping up the Romania factory and optimizing the new manufacturing footprint.</li> <li>Analysts' concerns shifted from general market conditions to specific execution risks related to the Romania ramp-up and North American performance.</li> <li>Segment operating profit margins declined in Q4 compared to Q3, primarily due to a weaker product mix and higher costs.</li> <li>Management's confidence in key initiatives, such as the Romania factory and new product launches, was more pronounced this quarter.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management acknowledged challenges in North America, including pricing pressures and a shift in consumer preferences toward lower-tier brands.</li> <li>The ramp-up of the Romania factory poses execution risks, including potential delays and cost overruns.</li> <li>Analysts expressed concerns about the impact of contract manufacturing on margins and the pace of operational improvements in key markets.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Nokian Renkaat’s Q4 2024 earnings call highlighted solid growth in Central Europe, tempered by challenges in North America and a less favorable product mix.
