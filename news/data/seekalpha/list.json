He noted a 12% growth in FFO per share and a 19% growth<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> in AFFO per share over the last three years. The company's 2025 guidance reflects additional growth potential.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The merger with Physicians Realty has been highly successful, with substantial synergies and a robust development pipeline. The company aims to deploy $500 million in investments in 2025, including opportunities in life sciences and outpatient medical sectors.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Brinker emphasized the company's plans to internalize property management across its portfolio, which is expected to deliver financial and strategic benefits. </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CFO Peter Scott reported strong Q4 results, with adjusted FFO per share at $0.46 and AFFO per share at $0.40. He highlighted a balance sheet with a net debt-to-EBITDA of 5.2x, positioning the company to capitalize on market opportunities.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>The company forecasts adjusted FFO for 2025 to range between $1.81 and $1.87 per share, with total same-store growth expected at 3% to 4%. </li> <li>Segment-level guidance includes outpatient medical growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, lab growth of 3% to 4%, and CCRCs growth of 4% to 8%. </li> <li>Planned investments in 2025 include $500 million with a weighted average yield of 8% or higher, focusing on lab loan investments and outpatient pre-leased developments.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>For Q4, Healthpeak Properties reported 5.4% same-store growth across the total portfolio.

CEO Brinker noted over 300,000 square feet under LOI and significant ongoing activity, with over 50% of targeted cash NOI already achieved.</li> <li>Juan Sanabria, BMO Capital Markets: Inquired about the $500 million investment plan for 2025. CFO Scott explained the allocation between life sciences and outpatient medical, with most projects being accretive loans or development opportunities.</li> <li>Austin Wurschmidt, KeyBanc Capital Markets: Sought clarification on deceleration in same-store growth guidance. CFO Scott attributed it to internalization benefits realized in 2024 and a more conservative outlook for CCRCs.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts raised concerns about market conditions in life sciences and outpatient medical sectors but generally acknowledged the company's strategic positioning and growth initiatives.

Same-store growth projections were reduced slightly from 5.4% in Q4 to a range of 3% to 4%.</li> <li>Strategic focus shifted towards capital deployment in life sciences through structured investments and development projects, contrasting with the Q3 emphasis on merger synergies.</li> <li>Analysts' focus remained on leasing momentum and investment allocation, with more pointed questions on distressed opportunities in life sciences.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management acknowledged challenges in the life sciences sector, including oversupply and tenant credit risks.
