Excluding Russia and Belarus, consolidated profits<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> for the core group stood at €975 million, with a return on equity of 15%, slightly exceeding guidance. </span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Loans to customers increased by 3% in 2024, while net interest income was flat at €4.155 billion. Fee income grew by 5% to €1.804 billion. Operating expenses finished at €3.3 billion, resulting in a cost-income ratio of 52.5%.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">A dividend proposal of €1.1 per share was announced, slightly lower than the previous year, reflecting the group's effort to offer shareholders consistent returns despite headwinds.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CFO Hannes Mosenbacher highlighted risk costs at 27 basis points for the core group, below the 35 basis points guidance, and noted €370 million in overlays available for 2025.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management expects net interest income to remain stable in 2025, with fee income seeing further improvements. Operating expenses are projected around €3.45 billion, maintaining a cost-income ratio of 52.5%.</li> <li>Loan growth for 2025 is targeted at 6-7%, driven by stronger performance in key markets such as Slovakia, Romania, and Czechia.</li> <li>The CET1 ratio, excluding Russia, is projected to stabilize at 15.2% by the end of 2025, supported by Basel IV implementation.</li> <li>CEO Strobl outlined expectations for profitability at around 10% in 2025, with potential for 13% return on equity once legacy litigation issues in Poland are resolved.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Group consolidated profits fell year-on-year due to the €824 million impact from the Belarus sale and litigation provisions in Poland. For the core group, excluding Russia and Belarus, profits remained stable at €975 million.</li> <li>Fee income grew by 5% year-on-year to €1.804 billion, supported by strong seasonal performance across key markets and product lines in Q4.</li> <li>Net interest income was stable at €4.155 billion, with slight positive contributions from Austria and Czech Republic offsetting headwinds.</li> <li>Loans to customers increased by 3%, with strong trends in corporate lending in Austria and stable retail portfolios, particularly in Slovakia and Czech Republic.</li> <li>Liquidity remained robust, with a CET1 ratio of 15.1% for the core group, excluding Russia.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q&amp;A</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Benoit Petrarque, Kepler Cheuvreux: Questioned updates on the Russia exit process.

CEO Strobl expressed skepticism about regulatory approval for dividends given current constraints.</li> <li>Paul Fenner, Societe Generale: Inquired about provisions related to the Russian court case. CEO Strobl explained that the €800 million provision reflects current valuation assumptions and legal uncertainties, with further developments contingent on court outcomes.</li> <li>Simon Nellis, Citi: Queried the rationale behind the €1.1 dividend proposal. CEO Strobl emphasized the importance of maintaining a CET1 ratio above the 14.5% target, given ongoing uncertainties.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts expressed skepticism and concern, particularly regarding the ongoing challenges in Russia and the impact of litigation provisions in Poland. Questions focused on the pace of business reduction and potential financial risks.</li> <li>Management maintained a cautiously optimistic tone during prepared remarks but displayed a defensive posture in addressing analyst concerns, particularly regarding Russia. CEO Strobl consistently reiterated the group’s compliance efforts and commitment to derisking.</li> <li>Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone reflected a slight increase in confidence, particularly regarding the core group's performance and outlook.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Guidance for profitability and loan growth has improved, with 2025 targets reflecting higher confidence in operational stability.</li> <li>Strategic focus has shifted further towards derisking the Eastern European footprint, with the closure of the Belarus sale and continued reduction of Russian operations.</li> <li>Analyst questions in the current quarter were more focused on legal and regulatory risks, reflecting heightened concerns compared to the prior period.</li> <li>Management's tone showed a slight improvement in confidence, particularly regarding fee income growth and CET1 ratio stability.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Legal proceedings in Russia, including the €244 million court ruling and related provisions, pose significant uncertainties.</li> <li>Litigation provisions in Poland continue to weigh on profitability, though management expects some relief in 2025.</li> <li>Challenges in exiting Russia are compounded by regulatory constraints and equity valuation complexities.</li> <li>Macroeconomic weaknesses in Austria and Germany, combined with geopolitical risks, remain ongoing concerns.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Raiffeisen Bank International's Q4 2024 performance reflects a stable core group despite external challenges, including legal provisions and the Belarus sale impact. Management provided a cautiously optimistic outlook for 2025, targeting 6-7% loan growth, a 15.2% CET1 ratio, and stable net interest income. However, ongoing litigation and geopolitical tensions remain critical risks to monitor. Investors will likely focus on the group's ability to navigate these challenges while maintaining operational resilience and profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RAIFF/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p> </body></html>",
