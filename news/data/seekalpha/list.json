Adjusted EBITA margin for the quarter stood at 16.7%, with a full-year margin of 15.5%, in line with targets.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Omnicom generated nearly $2 billion in free cash flow during 2024, with over $900 million returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Wren announced progress on the proposed acquisition of Interpublic Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IPG\" title=\"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.\">IPG</a>), projecting $750 million in cost synergies post-merger. Synergy savings will come from eliminating duplicative expenses, aligning real estate portfolios, and merging corporate functions. He also emphasized substantial revenue growth opportunities through expanded client offerings.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CFO Phil Angelastro reported that foreign currency translation reduced Q4 revenue by 0.6% and is expected to impact Q1 2025 revenue by 2%-2.5%. He confirmed an adjusted diluted EPS for Q4 2024 at $2.41, a 6.6% increase compared to the same period in 2023.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management provided 2025 organic growth guidance of 3.5%-4.5% and projected adjusted EBITA margin improvement of 10 basis points year-over-year. </li> <li>Wren noted caution in the outlook, citing macroeconomic uncertainties, including potential regulatory and policy changes in the U.S. auto sector and other industries.</li> <li>The IPG acquisition is anticipated to close in the second half of 2025, with significant synergies and expanded client opportunities expected to follow.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Q4 organic growth was 5.2%, with Media &amp; Advertising up 7%, Precision Marketing up 9%, and Public Relations up 10%. Performance was particularly strong in the U.S., which achieved 10% organic growth.</li> <li>Healthcare revenues declined by 4% due to a significant client loss, though new wins are expected to drive improvements in the second half of 2025.</li> <li>Free cash flow for the year grew by 4.2%, reaching nearly $2 billion.

CFO Angelastro attributed the strong finish to robust Media and Precision Marketing performances, as well as election-related PR spending. Wren emphasized a conservative outlook due to early-year uncertainties.</li> <li>David Karnovsky, JPMorgan: Queried client reactions to the IPG merger. Wren stated that feedback has been constructive, with clients optimistic about the combined capabilities. Karnovsky also asked about margin dynamics, to which Angelastro highlighted investments in Flywheel and technology platforms as key factors maintaining flat margins.</li> <li>Craig Huber, Huber Research: Asked about revenue synergies from the IPG acquisition. Wren expressed confidence in opportunities across Media and first-party data solutions, driven by Acxiom and Flywheel enhancements.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts exhibited a slightly positive tone, expressing interest in Omnicom's growth outlook and the IPG acquisition's potential synergies.

Media and Precision Marketing continued to drive growth in both quarters.</li> <li>Margins were flat year-over-year in both Q3 and Q4, as ongoing investments in technology and new business integrations offset efficiency gains.</li> <li>Analysts' focus shifted from general performance in Q3 to specific concerns about 2025 guidance and post-merger synergies in Q4.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management highlighted potential macroeconomic and policy challenges, particularly related to U.S. government changes and their impact on key sectors.</li> <li>Analysts raised questions about the pace of integration for Flywheel and IPG, along with the potential for cost overruns in planned investments.</li> <li>Foreign currency translation remains a near-term headwind, projected to reduce Q1 2025 revenue by 2%-2.5%.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Omnicom delivered strong Q4 results, exceeding full-year organic growth guidance and maintaining flat margins despite significant investments. The company is optimistic about 2025 opportunities, projecting 3.5%-4.5% organic growth and improved margins.
