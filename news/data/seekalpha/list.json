Sequential growth was driven by higher member months but offset by lower Medicare rates tied to decreasing risk scores.</li> <li>External provider costs rose to $107.9M, primarily due to member month increases, though cost per participant decreased. Cost of care excluding depreciation and amortization increased to $64.1M, reflecting higher wages and headcount.</li> <li>Net loss widened to $13.5M due to an $8.5M impairment related to halting a de novo center in Louisville, Kentucky. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.9M, down from $6.9M in Q2 FY2024.</li> <li>The company ended the quarter with $46.1M in cash and $40.8M in short-term investments, alongside $78.3M in total debt.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q&amp;A</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Jamie Perse, Goldman Sachs: Questioned the transformation strategy and its components.
