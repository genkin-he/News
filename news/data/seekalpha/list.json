He emphasized the company's strategic inclusion<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> in the S&amp;P 500 as a reflection of its growth and institutionalization.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Rowan reiterated Apollo’s five-year targets, which include 20% average annual FRE growth, 10% SRE growth, and doubling ANI by 2029. He stressed a focus on execution and origination capabilities to capitalize on four key market drivers: global industrial renaissance, retirement services, individual investor growth, and public-private asset convergence.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The CEO announced the acquisition of Argo, an infrastructure manager, adding $6 billion to assets under management (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AUM\" title=\"Intl Sec Exch ISE Spot AUDUSD Index\">AUM</a>) and 20 origination professionals to expand Apollo’s infrastructure capabilities.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CFO Martin Kelly noted that FRE grew 17% year-over-year, driven by management fees and capital solutions fees. He also confirmed key investments in global wealth, third-party credit, and private equity-adjacent businesses to fuel future growth.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">President Jim Zelter highlighted record origination volumes of $222 billion in 2024, supported by a diversified portfolio of debt and equity strategies.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management reaffirmed its five-year plan, targeting annual origination of $275 billion by 2029. Rowan stated that origination growth will be balanced across Atlas SP, lender finance, and direct lending platforms.</li> <li>FRE is expected to grow by 15%-20% in 2025, aligning with non-flagship private equity years, while SRE is projected to reach approximately $3.5 billion, assuming an 11% alternatives return and consistent interest rate headwinds.</li> <li>Rowan reiterated Apollo’s ambition to double its credit business and significantly grow its equity business, particularly in hybrid equity, over the five-year plan.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>FRE reached a quarterly record of $554 million, while SRE totaled $841 million.

Rowan emphasized the opportunity in integrating private assets into retirement solutions, highlighting potential 50%-100% better outcomes compared to public-only portfolios.</li> <li>Glenn Schorr, Evercore ISI, asked about the convergence of public and private assets. Rowan responded that traditional asset managers are increasingly adopting private assets to remain competitive, predicting significant demand for private investment-grade products.</li> <li>Alex Blostein, Goldman Sachs, questioned origination growth and M&amp;A strategy. Zelter emphasized geographic expansion and the scaling of hybrid origination, citing partnerships with European banks and other global institutions.</li> <li>Patrick Davitt, Autonomous Research, asked about costs in retail distribution. CFO Martin Kelly clarified that most costs are netted against revenue, with no expected margin degradation.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts expressed cautious optimism, focusing on Apollo’s ability to execute its ambitious five-year plan amid macroeconomic uncertainties. Questions centered on origination growth, regulatory risks, and retail expansion.</li> <li>Management maintained a confident tone, emphasizing strategic milestones while acknowledging challenges. Rowan’s repeated focus on execution and origination highlighted the firm’s commitment to disciplined growth.</li> <li>Compared to the previous quarter, analysts appeared more focused on regulatory and competitive dynamics, while management showed consistent confidence in its long-term strategy.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>FRE increased from $531 million to $554 million, reflecting continued growth in fee-related revenues. Adjusted net income also grew significantly from $1.1 billion in Q3 to $1.4 billion in Q4.</li> <li>Origination volumes grew from $194 billion year-to-date in Q3 to a record $222 billion for the full year, driven by Atlas and other platforms.</li> <li>Management’s tone remained confident, but the focus shifted more toward execution risks and competitive pressures compared to Q3’s emphasis on broad market opportunities.</li> <li>Analysts in Q4 raised more questions about regulatory and competitive challenges, indicating a slight shift in focus from growth to operational risks.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Rowan identified internal execution as the primary risk to achieving Apollo’s five-year targets, emphasizing the need to align resources and maintain a growth-oriented culture.</li> <li>Regulatory changes in retirement and insurance markets could impact Apollo’s ability to scale its business. Rowan noted potential risks related to offshore capital regimes and industry-wide consolidation.</li> <li>Analysts expressed concerns about competitive pressures in private credit and retirement services, particularly as other asset managers enter these markets.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Apollo Global Management delivered a record quarter, showcasing strong growth across fee-related and spread-related earnings. With ambitious five-year targets of 20% FRE growth and $275 billion annual origination, the firm remains focused on execution and expanding its origination capabilities.

Excluding Russia and Belarus, consolidated profits<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> for the core group stood at €975 million, with a return on equity of 15%, slightly exceeding guidance. </span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Loans to customers increased by 3% in 2024, while net interest income was flat at €4.155 billion. Fee income grew by 5% to €1.804 billion. Operating expenses finished at €3.3 billion, resulting in a cost-income ratio of 52.5%.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">A dividend proposal of €1.1 per share was announced, slightly lower than the previous year, reflecting the group's effort to offer shareholders consistent returns despite headwinds.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CFO Hannes Mosenbacher highlighted risk costs at 27 basis points for the core group, below the 35 basis points guidance, and noted €370 million in overlays available for 2025.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management expects net interest income to remain stable in 2025, with fee income seeing further improvements. Operating expenses are projected around €3.45 billion, maintaining a cost-income ratio of 52.5%.</li> <li>Loan growth for 2025 is targeted at 6-7%, driven by stronger performance in key markets such as Slovakia, Romania, and Czechia.</li> <li>The CET1 ratio, excluding Russia, is projected to stabilize at 15.2% by the end of 2025, supported by Basel IV implementation.</li> <li>CEO Strobl outlined expectations for profitability at around 10% in 2025, with potential for 13% return on equity once legacy litigation issues in Poland are resolved.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Group consolidated profits fell year-on-year due to the €824 million impact from the Belarus sale and litigation provisions in Poland. For the core group, excluding Russia and Belarus, profits remained stable at €975 million.</li> <li>Fee income grew by 5% year-on-year to €1.804 billion, supported by strong seasonal performance across key markets and product lines in Q4.</li> <li>Net interest income was stable at €4.155 billion, with slight positive contributions from Austria and Czech Republic offsetting headwinds.</li> <li>Loans to customers increased by 3%, with strong trends in corporate lending in Austria and stable retail portfolios, particularly in Slovakia and Czech Republic.</li> <li>Liquidity remained robust, with a CET1 ratio of 15.1% for the core group, excluding Russia.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q&amp;A</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Benoit Petrarque, Kepler Cheuvreux: Questioned updates on the Russia exit process.

CEO Strobl expressed skepticism about regulatory approval for dividends given current constraints.</li> <li>Paul Fenner, Societe Generale: Inquired about provisions related to the Russian court case. CEO Strobl explained that the €800 million provision reflects current valuation assumptions and legal uncertainties, with further developments contingent on court outcomes.</li> <li>Simon Nellis, Citi: Queried the rationale behind the €1.1 dividend proposal. CEO Strobl emphasized the importance of maintaining a CET1 ratio above the 14.5% target, given ongoing uncertainties.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts expressed skepticism and concern, particularly regarding the ongoing challenges in Russia and the impact of litigation provisions in Poland. Questions focused on the pace of business reduction and potential financial risks.</li> <li>Management maintained a cautiously optimistic tone during prepared remarks but displayed a defensive posture in addressing analyst concerns, particularly regarding Russia.

Management provided a cautiously optimistic outlook for 2025, targeting 6-7% loan growth, a 15.2% CET1 ratio, and stable net interest income. However, ongoing litigation and geopolitical tensions remain critical risks to monitor. Investors will likely focus on the group's ability to navigate these challenges while maintaining operational resilience and profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RAIFF/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p> </body></html>",
