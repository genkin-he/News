When the offer was unveiled last week, officials expected that 5%-10% of those eligible would accept it. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">That target could be difficult, Bloomberg said. The government has almost 2.3M civilian federal employees, but perhaps half of them aren't eligible for the offer. The program excludes postal workers, law enforcement employees, and civilian defense and intelligence personnel, as well as certain other sensitive roles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Meanwhile, federal employee units have told their members to be skeptical of the offers, which they said aren't guaranteed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-97cb501b-7fff-185d-6f71-065974b2577e\">Dear readers: </strong>We recognize that politics often intersects with the financial news of the day, so we invite you to click <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4752436-politics-and-the-markets-020425\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"here to join the separate political discussion.\">here to join the separate political discussion.</a></p> </body></html>",
