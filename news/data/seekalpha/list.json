The drugmaker remains committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2045, and aims to cut scope 3 emissions by a third from 2024 to 2033.</span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">These measures will include switching to low-carbon materials and feedstock in its production network, shifting distribution to low-emissions transportation and supporting suppliers in transitioning to renewable energy. More than 1,800 suppliers have committed to the transition, according to Novo Nordisk.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">However, Katrine DiBona, vice president of sustainability at Novo Nordisk, told Reuters that some measures will not be available until years later, and emissions will continue to rise up to 2030.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">While sustainability efforts have little impact on stock valuation, it will be interesting to see how its key rival Eli Lilly’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY\" title=\"Eli Lilly and Company\">LLY</a>) emissions have been impacted by soaring demand for weight loss drugs.
