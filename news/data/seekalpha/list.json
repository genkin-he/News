(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KFRC\" title=\"Kforce Inc.\">KFRC</a></span>) Q4 2024 </p> <h3>Management View</h3> <ul> <li><p>Joe Liberatore, President and CEO, highlighted the company's stability in the technology services market and reaffirmed its focus on long-term growth strategies. He emphasized the operational readiness of Kforce’s new India Development Center, which<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> officially opened in January 2025. This offshore facility is expected to expand the company's capabilities for delivering blended onshore, nearshore, and offshore solutions, addressing evolving client demands.</span></p></li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>Liberatore reiterated the company’s financial objectives of reaching $1.7 billion in annual revenue, with a longer-term target of at least 10% operating margins at $2.1 billion in annual revenue. He acknowledged that clients remain cautious, delaying technology projects due to macroeconomic uncertainties, but expressed optimism that confidence and project investments could improve later in 2025.</p></li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>CFO Jeff Hackman noted, \"Earnings per share of $0.60 were at the midpoint of our guidance,\" and explained that higher-than-expected healthcare costs had impacted margins. He also mentioned that operating cash flows were $22 million for the quarter, while $65 million in capital was returned to shareholders for the full year through dividends and share repurchases.</p></li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li><p>Kforce projects Q1 2025 revenue to range between $330 million and $338 million, with earnings per share expected to fall between $0.44 and $0.52. This guidance reflects typical seasonal tax resets and holiday impacts but assumes a stable demand environment.</p></li> <li><p>Management remains optimistic about the long-term potential of AI and other innovative technologies to drive demand for technology services. Conversations with clients suggest a backlog of strategically important technology projects, which could be activated once economic confidence improves.</p></li> <li><p>The India Development Center is expected to contribute to revenue growth in 2025, although the ramp-up will be gradual and directly driven by client needs for offshore delivery capabilities.</p></li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li><p>Fourth-quarter revenue totaled $343.8 million, exceeding the midpoint of guidance and reflecting a 0.4% sequential growth on a billing day basis. The company’s technology business grew 0.6% sequentially, while year-over-year revenue declined by 5.2% per billing day.</p></li> <li><p>Flex margins in the technology business declined 80 basis points sequentially, primarily due to higher healthcare costs and holiday seasonality. However, bill-pay spreads remained stable year-over-year, signaling resilience in pricing.</p></li> <li><p>Full-year 2024 revenue came in at $1.41 billion, a 9% decrease year-over-year, with earnings per share at $2.68. Operating cash flows for the year amounted to $87 million, with significant capital returned to shareholders.</p></li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q&amp;A</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li><p>Mark Marcon, Baird: Questioned what Kforce's clients need to see to initiate delayed technology projects. Joe Liberatore responded, \"Clients are looking for predictability and stability,\" and noted increased client meetings and job orders as early indicators of improving sentiment.</p></li> <li><p>Trevor Romeo, William Blair: Inquired about historical recovery cycles and how client confidence translates into spending. Liberatore explained that project work typically resumes before full-time hiring, adding, \"We are well-positioned to benefit from these cycles with our diversified client base.\"</p></li> <li><p>Kartik Mehta, Northcoast Research: Asked about capacity utilization and flexibility in scaling operations. Dave Kelly emphasized that the company has ample capacity to absorb demand increases without significant new investments, highlighting the scalability of its India Development Center.</p></li> <li><p>Tobey Sommer, Truist Securities: Asked about the drivers behind the expected 100 basis points improvement in operating margins when revenue returns to $1.7 billion. CFO Jeff Hackman cited cost efficiencies from the India facility, integrated solutions offerings, and back-office transformations as significant contributors.</p></li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li><p>Analysts expressed cautious optimism, probing for clarity on demand trends and the potential timing of project backlogs materializing. Questions reflected curiosity about the company's ability to unlock opportunities in a challenging macro environment.</p></li> <li><p>Management’s tone was confident and forward-looking, particularly regarding its strategic initiatives like the India Development Center and AI-focused solutions. However, responses to near-term demand visibility remained measured, emphasizing stability rather than immediate growth.</p></li> <li><p>Compared to the previous quarter, the tone reflected slightly higher optimism, supported by modest improvements in client activity and early indicators of confidence.</p></li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li><p>Revenue stability persisted, with Q4 revenue slightly exceeding guidance, compared to a modest sequential decline in Q3. Earnings per share remained within the guided range, though slightly lower than Q3 EPS of $0.75.</p></li> <li><p>Strategic focus shifted further to long-term growth initiatives, with the operational launch of the India Development Center adding a significant new capability.</p></li> <li><p>Analysts maintained consistent concerns about macroeconomic uncertainties but showed increased interest in AI-driven opportunities and offshore delivery capabilities.</p></li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li><p>Management flagged the uncertain macroeconomic environment, including client hesitancy to initiate projects due to inflationary pressures and geopolitical concerns.</p></li> <li><p>Healthcare cost volatility significantly impacted Q4 margins, emphasizing a potential area of ongoing financial risk.</p></li> <li><p>Analysts raised questions about the scalability and profitability of the new India facility, reflecting broader concerns about execution risks for offshore expansion.</p></li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Kforce's Q4 2024 earnings call highlighted the company’s focus on stability and strategic growth amid macroeconomic uncertainties. The operational launch of the India Development Center marks a key milestone, positioning the company to capture offshore and blended project opportunities. While the near-term demand environment remains subdued, Kforce’s investments in AI-related services and long-term margin improvements signal confidence in its ability to achieve $1.7 billion in annual revenue and double-digit operating margins in future years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KFRC/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p> </body></html>",

Blankenship clarified that revenue is primarily tied to engine hours rather than event-driven shop visits, with LEAP and GTF engine inputs growing steadily.</li> <li>Matthew Akers, Wells Fargo, sought details on the Safran acquisition. Blankenship highlighted its strategic importance in enhancing electromechanical flight control capabilities and increasing content on single-aisle aircraft.</li> <li>Noah Poponak, Goldman Sachs, questioned LEAP engine aftermarket contributions.
