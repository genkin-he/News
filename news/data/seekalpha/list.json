            "description": "<html><body><div> <p>U.S. stock index futures on Wednesday were mixed, as investors waded through more quarterly results. Here are some stocks to watch on Wednesday: </p> <ul> <li>Shares of Walt Disney (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) <span style=\"color: #008000;\">added more than 1%</span> in pre-market trading, after the world's largest entertainment<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> company handily beat FQ1 2025 bottom-line estimates. Operating income in Disney's (</span><a class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\" href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">) movies and streaming business surged by $800M, helped by smash animated hit Moana 2. That helped offset a nearly 700K decrease in Disney+ subscribers. Meanwhile, operating income at Disney's (</span><a class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\" href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">) theme parks unit slipped 5% Y/Y, hurt by an adverse impact from hurricanes Milton and Helene and expenses related to the opening of Disney Treasure. For fiscal year 2025, DIS sees high-single digit adjusted earning per share growth compared to 2024. See how DIS performed in charts. </span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Uber Technologies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UBER\" title=\"Uber Technologies, Inc.\">UBER</a>) stock <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">shed 5%</span> ahead of the opening bell, after the ride-hailing giant's current quarter gross bookings and adjusted EBITDA guidance fell slightly short of expectations. The outlook overshadowed a Q4 that top boss Dara Khosrowshahi called Uber's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UBER\" title=\"Uber Technologies, Inc.\">UBER</a>) \"strongest quarter ever.\" Gross bookings for the quarter increased 18% Y/Y to $44.2B. \"We believe we remain undervalued despite...strong fundamentals, and plan to be active and opportunistic buyers of our stock,” finance chief Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah said. See how UBER performed in charts.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVO\" title=\"Novo Nordisk A/S\">NVO</a>) <span style=\"color: #008000;\">gained over 4%</span> ahead of market open, after the Danish drugmaker reported a 25% Y/Y increase in full-year 2024 net sales and operating profit, largely on the back of sky-high demand for its blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy. Sales of the medicine soared 86% to DKK 58.21B ($8.13B). \"We are pleased with the performance in 2024, where 26% sales growth reflects that more than 45M people are now benefiting from our treatments,\" chief executive Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen said. Separately, Novo (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVO\" title=\"Novo Nordisk A/S\">NVO</a>) said that its emissions rose by nearly a quarter in 2024 due to increased production to meet demand for Wegovy.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Qualcomm (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM\" title=\"QUALCOMM Incorporated\">QCOM</a>) stock will be in focus, ahead of the chip designer's FQ1 2025 results after the closing bell. Wall Street expects the company to earn $2.97 per share on revenue of $10.90B. Qualcomm (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM\" title=\"QUALCOMM Incorporated\">QCOM</a>) makes chips that power everything from smartphones to laptops to digital systems in cars and houses. Investors will be keeping an eye out for demand trends on China OEMs, demand for the SnapDragon Elite X, and outlook for iPhone modem share in 2025/2026. Both the top- and bottom-line figures are seen rising by nearly double-digit percentages Y/Y, driven by an increased demand for China smartphones from the rollout of handset subsidies.</li> </ul> </div> </body></html>",
