This contributed to a 20% gain in total revenue to $12.0B, beating Wall Street’s expectations by $190M.</span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">“Uber ended 2024 with our strongest quarter ever, as growth accelerated across MAPCs, trips, and Gross Bookings,” CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said, adding that the company’s performance was powered by rapid innovation and execution across multiple priorities.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">“We enter 2025 with clear momentum and will continue to be relentless against our long-term strategy,” he added.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">While there were certainly signs of significant progress for the ride-sharing company, investors seemed to be more concerned with currency headwinds that will likely dampen growth for the current quarter.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">Uber (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UBER\" title=\"Uber Technologies, Inc.\">UBER</a></span>) projected Q1 gross bookings to be between $42B to $43.5B, translating into a midpoint of $42.8B, below the consensus forecast of $43.5B. Additionally, the midpoint of the adjusted EBITDA range of $1.79B and $1.89B is also slightly below consensus estimates of $1.85B.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">In addition, for the reported quarter, the company’s profit swelled to $6.9B, or $3.21 per share, but was largely attributed to a $6.4B tax valuation adjustment. Instead, adjusted EBITDA of $1.84B missed the consensus estimate of $1.85B, while operating income of $770M also missed the consensus estimate of $1.15B.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">Uber (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UBER\" title=\"Uber Technologies, Inc.\">UBER</a>) shares were down as much as 10% on the initial reaction to the results, but have since recouped some losses, <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">down 5% </span>in premarket.
