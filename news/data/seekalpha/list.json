He emphasized the divestment of the Skin Care business, expected to improve the EBIT<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> margin by 30 basis points this fiscal year, and noted that this would reduce reported revenue growth by approximately 1.5 percentage points.</span></p></li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>Management discussed the strong performance of Chronic Care, with Ostomy Care and Continence Care outpacing market growth. Luja, particularly the male catheter, was a key growth driver, and the female version is now expanding to nine markets, including the U.S.</p></li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>Villumsen noted double-digit growth for Atos Medical and Kerecis, with the latter achieving 32% growth in Q1.

Operating profit before special items increased by 5% year-over-year.</p></li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li><p>Coloplast reaffirmed its FY 2025 guidance of 8%-9% organic revenue growth and an EBIT margin of approximately 28%. The company anticipates second-half-weighted growth, driven by recovery in Emerging Markets and Interventional Urology, and continued contributions from innovation and acquisitions.</p></li> <li><p>Management stated that Kerecis should contribute around 1 percentage point to organic growth, with improved profitability expected. The delay in implementing the U.S. Local Coverage Determination (LCD) policy for skin substitutes to April 2025 is not expected to impact trading.</p></li> <li><p>EBIT margin improvement will be supported by easing inflationary pressures and profitability initiatives in Advanced Wound Care, including the Skin Care divestment.</p></li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li><p>Q1 2025 revenue increased by DKK 420 million, with organic growth contributing approximately DKK 500 million.

Villumsen responded that the company has resolved issues with the U.S. distribution center and product quality, adding, \"These are certainly aberrations that I do not expect to repeat.\"</p></li> <li><p>Jack Reynolds-Clark, RBC: Asked about margin headwinds from manufacturing ramp-ups. CFO Lonning-Skovgaard stated that gross margin for FY 2025 is expected to remain around 68%, supported by cost efficiencies and lower inflationary pressures.</p></li> <li><p>Lisa Clive, Bernstein: Inquired about the rate of women's health declines. Villumsen confirmed the decline has stopped, with the focus now on the Altis product and upcoming INTIBIA launch.</p></li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li><p>Analysts showed a mix of cautious and inquisitive tones, with concerns centered on execution risks, margin sustainability, and the impact of the delayed LCD implementation. Villumsen's responses were measured and aimed at reassuring stakeholders of the company's ability to navigate challenges.</p></li> <li><p>Management maintained a confident tone, particularly regarding growth prospects for Kerecis, the Luja launch, and recovery in Interventional Urology. Villumsen repeatedly emphasized readiness for the LCD opportunity and strong momentum in innovation.</p></li> <li><p>Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone reflected greater emphasis on addressing operational disruptions and elaborating on mitigation strategies.</p></li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li><p>Q1 2025 guidance language remained consistent with Q4 2024, though an increased focus was placed on recovering from the Interventional Urology recall and achieving second-half growth acceleration.</p></li> <li><p>Analysts continued to scrutinize execution challenges, particularly in the U.S. Chronic Care business and Kerecis LCD uncertainties.</p></li> <li><p>The gross margin remained stable quarter-over-quarter, while free cash flow improved significantly due to the Skin Care divestment.</p></li> <li><p>Management's sentiment appeared slightly more defensive, reflecting ongoing operational challenges, though confidence in growth drivers like Kerecis and Luja remained strong.</p></li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li><p>Management highlighted potential risks from the delayed LCD implementation and competitive pressures in Interventional Urology.</p></li> <li><p>Analysts expressed concerns about margin headwinds from manufacturing ramp-ups and the potential for lost sales in Bladder Health due to the product recall.</p></li> <li><p>Villumsen reiterated that the company is prepared for LCD-related opportunities and emphasized plans to recover lost sales in Interventional Urology during the second half of the year.</p></li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Coloplast delivered solid Q1 2025 results, with 8% organic growth and stable margins despite operational headwinds.

The Asian nation </span><a class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\" href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4402411-tit-for-tat-china-hits-back-with-tariffs-on-u_s_-coal-lng-vehicles\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"responded\">responded</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> with its own duties on imports of multiple American products, including LNG, coal and more. China's reaction was in stark contrast to Canada and Mexico, with the two North American nations showing a willingness to work with Trump.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">\"While markets may be inclined to read across from negotiating successes the U.S. had with Mexico and Canada, we think a lot is different in the U.S.-China trade relationship. A much more existential imbalance lies behind U.S. trade angst with China, which the Trump administration now seems keen to correct,\" Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">\"While the U.S. accounts for 29% of global consumption, it produces only 15% of the world's goods. Meanwhile, China accounts for 32% of global manufacturing but just 12% of consumption. Simplifying it, this imbalance shows up in a USD1tn Chinese trade surplus and a nearly equivalent U.S. deficit,\" Reid added.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">See the chart shared by Reid below:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/attachment/image/7f595483677cde940af304079d914aa4.png\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img alt=\"Trade imbalance chart\" data-caption=\"\" data-original-src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/attachment/image/7f595483677cde940af304079d914aa4.png\" data-source=\"Deutsche Bank\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/attachment/image/7f595483677cde940af304079d914aa4.png?io=getty-c-w900\" width=\"900\"/></a><figcaption class=\"overlay-title\"><p class=\"item-caption\"><span class=\"item-source\">Deutsche Bank</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">\"China's economic development in recent years, instead of moving it towards a consumer-oriented economy, has moved in the direction of a more advanced manufacturing economy. This is now causing consternation in the West, with China making strides in many high-value added capital goods,\" Reid said. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">China's disruptive power was on full display last week in the form of artificial intelligence (AI) startup DeepSeek and the hype around its low-cost language model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">\"While the U.S. is still the second-largest goods producer, it has less than half of China's global share, with many U.S. allies also seeing significant drops in their manufacturing share over the past 30 years. This may now have gone too far. Access to cheaper goods is no longer a good 'trade' for the U.S. given the loss of economic security over production supply chains and technologies to a competing power,\" Reid added.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Wall Street (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SP500</a>) on Tuesday <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4402743-sp500-nasdaq-dow-jones-outlook-stock-market\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"shook off\">shook off</a> the tariff drama and advanced.
