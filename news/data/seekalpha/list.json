CFO Lada noted that the acquisition enhances the company's ability to process lower-grade mixed polymers and accelerates cost savings from recycling initiatives.</li> <li>Keith Hughes, Truist: Inquired about January sell-through trends. Singh confirmed consistency with historical patterns and the company's guidance.</li> <li>Phil Ng, Jefferies: Asked about the potential of new railing products. Singh highlighted the $275 million vinyl rail market opportunity and the ability to target 65% of the rail market still dominated by wood.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts expressed cautious optimism, with questions largely focused on the sustainability of Q1's strong performance and demand trends.

Andreson noted a modest uptick in Q4, with stronger visibility for continued growth in the first half of 2025.</li> <li>Krish Sankar, TD Cowen: Asked about proprietary content’s impact on ASPs and market share. Andreson clarified that proprietary components will primarily improve profitability rather than ASPs, with some share gains expected from new applications.</li> <li>Tom Diffely, D.A.
