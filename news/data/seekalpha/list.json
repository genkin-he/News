            "description": "<html><body><p class=\"MsoNormal\">President Trump’s current trade policy and its turn to protectionism is creating significant risk to macroeconomic forecasts, rising hits to GDP and weighing on global growth, according to an <a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/tariff-moves-illustrate-risks-from-aggressive-us-trade-policy-04-02-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">article</a> by Fitch Ratings.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">If implemented, tariffs on almost all imports from<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> countries affected, would see a much bigger increase in effective U.S. tariff rates: from almost 0% to 25% for Mexico, and 20.5% for Canada.</span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">Also, although a 10 percentage point increase in the effective U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports to 20% “would less aggressive than the 25 percentage point rise assumed in [Fitch’s Global Economic Outlook <a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/global-economic-outlook-december-2024-05-12-2024\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a>] but does not signal more generous treatment, in our view,” according to economists, headed by Brian Coulton.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">They said that U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports will likely rise further this year, as President Trump has announced.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">“The jump in effective tariff rates on Canada and Mexico incorporated in the Feb. 1 announcement, along with our GEO (Global Economic Outlook) tariff assumptions for U.S. imports from other countries, would result in the overall U.S. effective tariff rate rising from 2.3% in 2023 to 13.3%.”</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">“That compares to the December GEO assumption that the U.S. average effective tariff rate would rise to 7.9% and would have a much bigger impact on the U.S. economy than in the GEO scenario.”</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">Coulton explained that the 11 percentage point rise in the overall U.S. effective tariff rate equal an extra $350B in import taxes, compared to the 2023 tax assumption of $72B.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">This is about 1.7% of U.S. consumption, and would put upward pressure on consumer prices and companies’ input costs, leading to an additional -0.4 percentage point impact on U.S. real GDP in 2026, double what was previously expected in Fitch’s GEO.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">However, impacts on the Mexican and Canadian economics would be far bigger, the report said.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal paywall-full-content invisible\">“Modelling the new tariff rates in the GEM (Fitch’s Global Sovereigns Outlook 2025 <a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/global-sovereigns-outlook-2025-25-11-2024\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a>) shows a negative real GDP impact in Mexico in 2026 of 2.3 percentage points from the GEO baseline, and of 1.4 percentage points for Canada.”</p> </body></html>",
