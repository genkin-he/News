            "description": "<html><body><p>Despite heightened volatility due to macroeconomic events toward the end of January, capital markets ended the month on a high note, with global stocks, bonds, and commodities posting gains. This positive momentum was reflected in a surge of capital flowing into exchange traded funds, which saw<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> their largest-ever inflow for the month.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In total, ETFs took in a staggering $92B in January, marking a 142% increase compared to the typical $39B monthly average. The bulk of these gains were concentrated in U.S. equity ETFs, which accounted for $40B—approximately 90% of all equity ETF inflows. Within the equity space, sector-focused ETFs saw notable inflows, with $10B entering sectors, most notably Financials and Technology, which together garnered $9B. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Bond ETFs also experienced a robust influx of capital, drawing $37B in inflows—the second largest on record. A significant portion of this came from risk-on credit sectors, including a record $7B into bank loan and collateralized loan obligation (CLO) ETFs. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Perhaps one of the most noteworthy trends was the performance of active ETFs, which experienced a record-breaking $43B in inflows. This was driven by unprecedented demand in both active equity and active fixed income products, signaling a growing appetite for more hands-on, dynamic investment strategies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As markets continue to rally, investor confidence appears to be strengthening, and ETF flows reflect the broader optimism surrounding global economy. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlined below are the world’s 20 largest exchange traded funds, ranked by assets under management: </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 20: Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VXUS\" title=\"Vanguard Total International Stock ETF\">VXUS</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 19: SPDR Gold Shares (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLD\" title=\"SPDR Gold Trust ETF\">GLD</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 18: iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IEMG\" title=\"iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF\">IEMG</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 17: Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VWO\" title=\"Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF\">VWO</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 16: Vanguard Information Technology ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VGT\" title=\"Vanguard Information Technology ETF\">VGT</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 15: Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VIG\" title=\"Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF\">VIG</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 14: iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IJR\" title=\"iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF\">IJR</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 13: iShares Core S&amp;P Mid-Cap ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IJH\" title=\"iShares Core S&amp;P MidCap ETF\">IJH</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 12: iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWF\" title=\"iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF\">IWF</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 11: iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AGG\" title=\"iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF\">AGG</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 10: Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BND\" title=\"Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF\">BND</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 9: iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IEFA\" title=\"BlackRock Institutional Trust Company N.A. - BTC iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF\">IEFA</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 8: Vanguard Value ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VTV\" title=\"Vanguard Value ETF\">VTV</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 7: Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VEA\" title=\"Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF\">VEA</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 6: Vanguard Growth ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VUG\" title=\"Vanguard Growth ETF\">VUG</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 5: Invesco QQQ Trust Series I (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ\" title=\"Invesco QQQ Trust ETF\">QQQ</a></span></span>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 4: Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VTI\" title=\"Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF\">VTI</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 3: iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSEARCA:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IVV\" title=\"iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF\">IVV</a></span></span>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 2: Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSEARCA:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VOO\" title=\"Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF\">VOO</a></span></span>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 1: SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSEARCA:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"SPDR® S&amp;P 500® ETF Trust\">SPY</a></span></span>)</p> </body></html>",
