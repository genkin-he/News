However, his acknowledgment of persistent macroeconomic challenges indicated a neutral to slightly positive tone compared to the prior quarter.</li> <li>Compared to Q4 2024, both analysts and management retained similar levels of confidence, with no significant tonal shifts.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Q1 2025 revenue of $1.11 billion slightly declined from Q4 2024 revenue of $1.26 billion, reflecting the seasonal nature of the business and the phase-out of $150 million in low-margin activities.</li> <li>Non-GAAP operating margins improved significantly from 18.7% in Q4 2024 to 21.2% in Q1 2025, driven by a sharper focus on higher-margin strategic areas.</li> <li>Backlog growth accelerated in Q1 2025, with a $80 million sequential increase compared to a $30 million increase in Q4 2024.

Key wins in cloud and digital modernization underscore its strategic focus on high-growth areas, supported by a $4.14 billion backlog. Margins improved significantly due to cost-cutting initiatives and the exit from low-margin activities. While the macroeconomic environment remains challenging, Amdocs’ robust pipeline and strong cloud momentum position it well for sustained growth in FY25.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOX/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p> </body></html>",

He highlighted a 34% year-over-year reduction in agricultural production hours during<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> Q4, which helped reduce dealer inventory by over $700 million, though further reductions are planned for the first half of 2025.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company achieved $600 million in cost savings by the end of 2024, on top of $185 million saved in 2023. Marx stated that these structural reductions are crucial for navigating the current market downturn and preparing for the industry's eventual upcycle.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CFO Oddone Incisa reported Q4 net sales of industrial activities at $4.1 billion, a 31% year-over-year decline, driven by weaker industry demand and channel destocking. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.15, down from $0.39 in Q4 2023. Free cash flow from industrial activities for Q4 was $848 million, but full-year cash flow ended with an outflow of $401 million.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>CNH Industrial expects global agricultural industry demand to decline by 5%-10% in 2025, translating to a 10%-15% decline for the company due to its exposure to cash crop equipment in North America. Agricultural net sales are forecasted to decrease by 13%-18%, with production hours planned to drop another 15%-20% year-over-year.</li> <li>Construction net sales are expected to decline by 5%-10% in 2025, with EBIT margin projected between 4%-5%. Combined industrial net sales are forecasted to decline 12%-17%, with adjusted EBIT margin anticipated between 6%-7%.</li> <li>The company forecasts full-year EPS for 2025 to range between $0.65 and $0.75. Free cash flow is expected to be positive, ranging from $200 million to $500 million, contingent on working capital dynamics.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Full-year 2024 net sales for industrial activities were $17.1 billion, down 23% year-over-year. Agricultural net sales fell 31% in Q4 and 23% for the full year, while construction net sales declined 33% in Q4 and 22% for the year.</li> <li>Adjusted EBIT margin for industrial activities in Q4 was 7.2%, ending the year at 10.5%. The gross margin for Q4 was 20.6%, impacted by lower volumes but partly offset by cost reduction initiatives.</li> <li>Precision-related components contributed $800 million in 2024 net sales, consistent with overall sales declines. The company increased the share of in-house solutions from 60% in 2023 to 80% in 2024.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q&amp;A</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Tami Zakaria, JPMorgan: Asked about pricing expectations for 2025 by segment and half-year breakdown. CEO Marx indicated pricing would be flat to slightly positive for the full year, with flat to slightly negative pricing in the first half and potential mid-single-digit growth in the second half.</li> <li>Mig Dobre, Baird: Inquired about potential production adjustments due to tariffs. Marx confirmed the company has flexibility to adjust production and pricing strategies but emphasized the need for stable policy conditions before making significant moves.</li> <li>David Raso, Evercore ISI: Asked about production versus retail alignment by geography. Marx explained that production hours in Q1 2025 are expected to decline by 10%-15% year-over-year, with further reductions in the first half to align with retail demand.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts expressed concern over inventory levels, pricing pressures, and geopolitical uncertainties impacting demand visibility. The tone was slightly negative, with recurring questions about destocking and pricing discipline.</li> <li>Management maintained a cautiously optimistic tone during prepared remarks, citing structural cost improvements and strategic inventory management as key enablers for long-term growth. However, the Q&amp;A session revealed a more defensive tone, especially regarding tariff impacts and production adjustments.</li> <li>Compared to the previous quarter, management appears more focused on mitigating immediate risks while emphasizing long-term positioning.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Guidance language shifted to emphasize a more conservative outlook for 2025, with net sales projected to decline 12%-17% compared to the prior year's forecast of stabilization.</li> <li>Management confidence in structural cost savings and operational efficiencies remains consistent, but analysts' skepticism has increased due to prolonged demand weakness and inventory challenges.</li> <li>Analysts' focus has shifted from production cuts to broader concerns about pricing discipline and geopolitical risks.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management highlighted geopolitical uncertainties, including potential tariffs and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, as key risks for 2025.</li> <li>Inventory destocking remains a significant challenge, with channel inventory levels still above targets in North America and Europe.</li> <li>Analysts raised concerns about pricing pressures in Latin America and Europe, as well as the potential for further demand deterioration in North America’s cash crop equipment market.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CNH Industrial is navigating a challenging market environment with strategic cost-saving measures, aggressive inventory management, and a focus on long-term positioning for an industry rebound. While 2025 is expected to be a trough year with significant declines in net sales and production volumes, the company remains committed to maintaining pricing discipline and advancing its product pipeline.
