For Q1, the company guided revenue between $1.33B and $1.36B, surpassing estimates of $1.33B, but its adjusted EBITDA forecast of $40M–$75M fell short of the $79.9M consensus. The company expects daily active users to reach 459M in the current quarter.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Lumen Technologies (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LUMN\" title=\"Lumen Technologies, Inc.\">LUMN</a></span>) shares <span style=\"color: #008000;\">surged nearly 10%</span> following upbeat Q4 results, driven by an 18.9% Y/Y rise in fiber broadband revenue within its Mass Markets segment and 42,000 Quantum Fiber customer additions, bringing total fiber-enabled homes to 4.16M by year-end. For FY2025, the company projects EBITDA between $3.2B and $3.4B and free cash flow of $700M to $900M. Lumen aims to achieve over $250M in run-rate cost savings by year-end, supporting its long-term goal of $1B in expense reductions by 2027. The company expects FY2025 capital expenditures in the range of $4.1B to $4.3B, with a focus on PCF contracts.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Enphase Energy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ENPH\" title=\"Enphase Energy, Inc.\">ENPH</a>) shares <span style=\"color: #008000;\">climbed 8%</span> after reporting better-than-expected Q4 results, with revenue rising 26.5% Y/Y. The company posted a GAAP gross margin of 51.8% and a non-GAAP gross margin of 53.2%, including a net IRA benefit of 13.5%. Free cash flow came in at $159.2M, with total liquidity of $1.72B. For Q1 2025, Enphase guided revenue between $340M and $380M, above the $340.91M consensus, including $50M in safe harbor revenue and shipments of 150–170 MWh of IQ Batteries. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected in the 48%–51% range, or 38%–41% excluding IRA benefits, with net IRA benefits projected at $36M–$39M based on 1.2M U.S.-manufactured microinverter shipments.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Biggest stock losers</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Alphabet (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a></span>) (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a></span>) shares <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">tumbled nearly 7% </span>after reporting mixed Q4 results, missing revenue expectations, and announcing a higher-than-expected $75B CapEx plan for FY2025, well above the $57.9B consensus. The company projects $16B–$18B in Q1 spending, with most investments directed toward AI-driven technical infrastructure, including servers and data centers. The company also warned of Q1 revenue headwinds from forex impacts and one fewer day of sales compared to the prior year, while also highlighting AI-driven growth in Search and Cloud, though Cloud revenue could see variability depending on new capacity rollouts.</li> <li>Advanced Micro Devices (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a></span>) shares <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">plunged over 9% </span>despite posting record Q4 2024 revenue growth of 24% Y/Y as investors reacted to slowing Data Center segment growth. While segment revenue surged 69% Y/Y, it marked the slowest increase in a year, down from 122% in Q3 and 114.5% in Q2. Weighing on sentiment, AMD’s Q1 revenue forecast of $6.8B–$7.4B, with a $7.1B midpoint slightly above the $7.04B consensus, failed to ease concerns over decelerating growth in its key business segment.</li> </ul> </body></html>",
