            "description": "<html><body><div> <p>U.S. stock index futures on Tuesday were <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4402528-sp500-nasdaq-dow-jones-outlook-stock-market\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"mixed\">mixed</a> amid small moves, as investors waded through more tariff drama and another deluge of quarterly earnings. Here are some stocks to watch on Tuesday: </p> <ul> <li>Shares of Pfizer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE\" title=\"Pfizer Inc.\">PFE</a>) <span style=\"color: #008000;\">gained more<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> than 1%</span></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> in pre-market trading, after the pharmaceutical major delivered a Q4 top- and bottom-line beat. Notably, Pfizer's (</span><a class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\" href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE\" title=\"Pfizer Inc.\">PFE</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">) Q4 revenue jumped 21% Y/Y, as sales from its portfolio of non-COVID drugs rose 11%. The company also reaffirmed all components of its full-year 2025 guidance. \"Last year we had a significant emphasis on improving our commercial effectiveness. In 2025 the emphasis will move to improving R&amp;D productivity, while maintaining focus on margin expansion, commercial excellence and shareholder friendly capital allocation,\" top boss Albert Bourla said in prepared remarks. </span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">PepsiCo (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PEP\" title=\"PepsiCo, Inc.\">PEP</a>) stock <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">slipped 2.5%</span>, after the soft drinks giant reported Q4 organic sales growth that missed expectations. Overall net revenue decreased 0.2%, as volume fell in PepsiCo's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PEP\" title=\"PepsiCo, Inc.\">PEP</a>) North American Frito-Lay and Quaker Foods segments. CEO Ramon Laguarta noted \"subdued category performance trends in North America, the continued impacts related to a recall in our Quaker Foods North America division and business disruptions due to geopolitical tensions in certain international markets.\" PEP expects to deliver low-single-digit organic revenue growth and mid-single-digit core constant currency EPS growth in 2025.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Shares of PayPal (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PYPL\" title=\"PayPal Holdings, Inc.\">PYPL</a>) <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">slumped more than 8%</span> ahead of market open, after the payment technology firm's Q4 margin weakness overshadowed strong profit guidance. PayPal's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PYPL\" title=\"PayPal Holdings, Inc.\">PYPL</a>) GAAP operating margin contracted 431 basis points to 17.2%, as the company faces increasing competition in its key payments processing business. “PayPal had a strong finish to a successful 2024 with results that were better than we expected,\" chief executive Alex Chriss said, adding that the improvements the company had made to branded checkout, peer-topeer, and Venmo, plus the progress it had made on its price-to-value strategy, was beginning to show up in its results.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) stock will be in focus, ahead of the Google-parent's Q4 results after the closing bell. Wall Street expects the Mountain View, Calif.-based firm to earn $2.13 per share on revenue of $96.67B. That top-line figure is anticipated to rise 12% Y/Y, driven by healthy digital advertising demand and growth in the cloud business. Following Meta Platforms' (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) solid advertising sales performance, that same strength is seen showing up in both Google Search and YouTube. Analysts will also want to hear management's thought on DeepSeek and artificial intelligence. </li> </ul> </div> </body></html>",
