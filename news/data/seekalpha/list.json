He attributed the<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> momentum to broad-based growth across both core and expanded markets, including Zecliner, Flex, Charisma, Big Box distribution, and Casegoods. </span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Schmidt emphasized improvements in operating margin, which rose to 6.1% compared to 4.6% in the prior year quarter. He noted strong operational execution and product portfolio management as critical drivers. </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Retailer engagement trends were positive, with a reported 18% increase in appointments at the Las Vegas market and strong feedback on new product launches.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CFO Mike Ressler reported Q2 net sales of $108.5 million, surpassing the guidance range of $103 million to $107 million. GAAP operating income was $11.7 million, including a $5 million pretax gain from a property sale, while adjusted operating income was $6.7 million or 6.1% of sales.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management provided Q3 2025 sales guidance of $110 million to $115 million, representing 3% to 7% growth over the prior year. Operating margin is expected to range between 6.0% and 7.0%, excluding potential tariff impacts. </li> <li>Gross margin is forecasted between 21% and 22%, supported by sales growth leverage but moderated by ocean freight costs and wage inflation in Mexico.</li> <li>Capital expenditures are projected between $0.7 million and $1 million, primarily for ERP modernization and supply chain maintenance.</li> <li>Schmidt identified tariffs as the most significant near-term risk, with potential 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada posing a material impact to margins. To mitigate these risks, Flexsteel is broadening its dual-sourcing capabilities and exploring alternative supply chain configurations.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Q2 net sales reached $108.5 million, up from $100.1 million in the prior year quarter. Positive drivers included strong unit volume growth and increased contributions from new product lines.</li> <li>Adjusted operating margin improved to 6.1%, supported by sales leverage and cost-saving initiatives. </li> <li>Flexsteel ended the quarter debt-free, with $11.8 million in cash and $98.1 million in working capital.

Derek Schmidt explained that growth was broad-based, with notable gains in new market initiatives and Flexsteel-branded core markets, though the ready-to-assemble Homestyles brand remained a weak point.</li> <li>Lebiedzinski inquired about ocean freight surcharges. CFO Mike Ressler noted volatility in rates and stated that surcharges are assessed regularly to maintain competitive pricing without margin expansion.</li> <li>On SG&amp;A trends, Schmidt stated that SG&amp;A costs are expected to remain within 15% to 15.5% of sales, balancing structural cost management with reinvestment in high ROI initiatives.</li> <li>Regarding tariffs, Ressler estimated a potential cost impact of $1.5 million to $2 million per month from a 25% tariff on Mexico. Schmidt emphasized that plans are in place to mitigate risks through diversified sourcing and supplier negotiations.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts raised concerns regarding tariffs and their financial impact, reflecting a cautious tone. Questions focused on contingency plans and structural cost management.</li> <li>Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, citing positive sales momentum and supply chain agility. However, their tone was more cautious during Q&amp;A, particularly around tariff risks and macroeconomic uncertainties.</li> <li>Compared to the previous quarter, the tone from both analysts and management indicated heightened sensitivity to external risks, such as tariffs and freight costs.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Sales growth slowed slightly from Q1’s 9.9% to Q2’s 8.4%, though it still exceeded guidance. Operating margin improved from 5.8% to 6.1% quarter-over-quarter.</li> <li>Tariff risks emerged as a new focus this quarter, with management outlining detailed mitigation strategies.</li> <li>Analysts maintained a consistent focus on SG&amp;A management and e-commerce performance across the two calls. However, this quarter saw intensified scrutiny on external risks such as trade policy changes.</li> <li>Management’s confidence in supply chain resilience remained steady, but tariff discussions introduced a more cautious tone compared to the prior quarter.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Tariffs on Mexico and Canada remain a significant risk, with potential cost impacts of $1.5 million to $2 million per month. Management is exploring dual-sourcing strategies and alternative supplier networks to mitigate exposure.</li> <li>Ocean freight cost volatility continues to pressure margins, though surcharges are being used to offset expenses.</li> <li>Competitive pressures in the low-cost ready-to-assemble furniture segment, particularly for the Homestyles brand, persist as a challenge.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Flexsteel Industries demonstrated strong revenue growth and margin improvement in Q2 2025, surpassing guidance expectations. Management remains optimistic about sustaining growth through diversified market initiatives and operational efficiency. However, heightened risks from potential tariffs and freight cost volatility could pose challenges ahead. Strategic mitigation plans, including diversified sourcing and high ROI investments, position the company to navigate these uncertainties while maintaining its growth trajectory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FLXS/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p> </body></html>",
