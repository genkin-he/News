Customer demand strengthened significantly, driven by applications in etch, CVD, and early recovery<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> in NAND technology investments. </span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Andreson emphasized the company’s proprietary content strategy, highlighting progress in qualifying high-purity valves, fittings, and substrates across multiple customers. These components, integrated into existing and next-generation gas panels, are expected to drive gross margin expansion in 2025.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Gross margin headwinds in Q4 were attributed to higher labor costs and inventory charges, but these are projected to dissipate by Q2 2025.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CFO Greg Swyt noted Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.08 and gross margin at 12%, which was below expectations due to labor and inventory costs. He projected Q1 2025 revenues of $235 million to $255 million, with gross margins improving to a range of 14% to 15%.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management raised its Q1 2025 revenue guidance range to $235 million to $255 million, supported by continued strong demand in etch and deposition markets. Gross margins are expected to improve sequentially, reaching 14% to 15% in Q1 and exceeding 16% for full-year 2025.</li> <li>Andreson expressed confidence in outperforming wafer fab equipment (WFE) growth in 2025, backed by proprietary content integration and favorable market dynamics, including increased etch and deposition intensity, NAND recovery, and advanced logic investments.</li> <li>The company anticipates flow-through of 25% to 30%, enabling gross margins in the 15% to 16% range by Q2 2025, with further improvement throughout the year.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Q4 revenue reached $233 million, surpassing the upper end of guidance and reflecting a 15% year-over-year increase. Gross margin dropped to 12%, impacted by higher direct labor costs and inventory adjustments.</li> <li>Full-year 2024 revenue totaled $849 million, up 5% year-over-year, with second-half growth of 10%.</li> <li>Operating expenses for Q4 were $22.3 million, slightly below forecast, while net interest expense stood at $1.7 million. The company ended the quarter with $109 million in cash and equivalents.</li> <li>Free cash flow for Q4 was negative $6.9 million, primarily due to a $11 million increase in inventory to support higher demand.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q&amp;A</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Craig Ellis, B. Riley Securities: Asked about gross margin drivers for 2025. CFO Greg Swyt explained that improvements will stem from proprietary products, volume leverage, and the absence of 2024 headwinds. CEO Jeff Andreson highlighted new product contributions as the largest driver.</li> <li>Brian Chin, Stifel: Inquired about NAND recovery. Andreson noted a modest uptick in Q4, with stronger visibility for continued growth in the first half of 2025.</li> <li>Krish Sankar, TD Cowen: Asked about proprietary content’s impact on ASPs and market share. Andreson clarified that proprietary components will primarily improve profitability rather than ASPs, with some share gains expected from new applications.</li> <li>Tom Diffely, D.A. Davidson: Questioned capacity utilization. Andreson stated that current infrastructure can support revenues well above $400 million, with incremental labor adjustments as needed.</li> <li>Edward Yang, Oppenheimer: Asked about the impact of new gas panel applications. Andreson confirmed progress on incremental share gains and emphasized the long-term potential of next-generation panels in 2026.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts highlighted optimism around revenue momentum and proprietary product progress but expressed caution regarding near-term gross margin headwinds and market dynamics. Questions focused on demand sustainability, NAND recovery, and margin expansion.</li> <li>Management showed confidence in addressing labor cost issues and emphasized long-term growth through proprietary content. Statements like “we are confident in our ability to outperform WFE growth” reflect a positive outlook.</li> <li>Compared to the previous quarter, management maintained a consistent tone of confidence but provided more specific details on 2025 revenue drivers and margin strategies.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Q4 revenue exceeded the previous quarter by 10%, while gross margin declined from 13.6% to 12% due to labor and inventory costs. EPS fell from $0.12 to $0.08.</li> <li>Management raised Q1 2025 revenue guidance compared to preliminary Q4 outlook, reflecting stronger demand visibility.</li> <li>Proprietary product qualifications advanced, with additional customer approvals for valves and fittings, compared to progress reported in Q3.</li> <li>Analysts’ focus shifted from macroeconomic concerns to specific growth drivers like NAND recovery and proprietary content.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Higher labor and inventory costs impacted Q4 gross margin and are expected to carry into early Q1 2025.</li> <li>Dependence on customer adoption of proprietary components for margin improvements introduces execution risk.</li> <li>Potential tariff impacts, though minimal for now, remain a concern for future cost structures.</li> <li>Market uncertainties in China and the timing of NAND recovery may affect revenue and growth projections.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Ichor Holdings demonstrated strong revenue growth and proprietary content progress in Q4 2024, positioning itself for significant margin expansion in 2025. Management’s confident outlook, supported by increased demand in etch and deposition markets, proprietary product adoption, and operational leverage, suggests the company is well-positioned to outperform WFE market growth in the coming year. However, lingering cost pressures and market uncertainties in China warrant close monitoring.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ICHR/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p> </body></html>",

Adjusted EPS for Q1 is projected at $0.05 to $0.15.</li> <li>The company anticipates pricing headwinds in 2025, primarily due to cost-plus contract adjustments with diamide partners. Volume growth will be driven by new products and expanded sales channels, while the correction year will focus on inventory reduction and repositioning.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>In Q4 2024, FMC reported $1.22 billion in revenue, supported by 7% growth compared to the prior year.

CEO Brondeau explained that FMC will expand its market through lower-cost solo formulations and innovative mixtures, while leveraging cost reductions.</li> <li>Josh Spector, UBS, queried the volume growth projection for 2025 amid weak Q1 expectations. Brondeau clarified that growth will come primarily from new products and channels, with minimal contributions from the core portfolio.</li> <li>Chris Parkinson, Wolfe Research, asked about confidence in achieving the 2025 guidance despite challenges. CFO Sandifer emphasized the back-end-loaded growth from new products and improved market conditions.</li> <li>Mike Harrison, Seaport Research Partners, inquired about LATAM distribution challenges.
