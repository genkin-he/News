With the recent tariff announcements, we are preparing for a dynamic backdrop in 2025 and expect to respond with supply chain and price actions designed to mitigate the impact from such tariffs to maintain our margin objectives, which enable us to fuel innovation and brand building. Our top priorities remain delivering margin expansion, cash generation and restoring balance sheet strength over the next 12 to 18 months to position the Company for long-term growth and value creation.\"<p>Management will provide its base planning assumptions and commentary on the current tariff environment. Excluding new tariffs, the Company's planning assumption is for 2025 EPS to be $4.05 (+/- $0.65) on a GAAP basis and $5.25 (+/- $0.50) on an adjusted basis<strong> (consensus of $$5.41)</strong>* and free cash flow* of $750 million (+/- $100 million). During the earnings call this morning, Management will review these planning assumptions in more detail. </p> <p>The difference between the 2025 GAAP and adjusted EPS* planning assumption is approximately $1.05 to $1.35, consisting primarily of charges related to the supply chain transformation under the Global Cost Reduction Program.</p> </li> </ul> </body></html>",
