The company achieved significant margin expansion across its segments, particularly through Transformation initiatives, while introducing 2025 adjusted EPS guidance<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> of $4.65 to $4.80, representing a 9% midpoint growth.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Stauch announced an increased 2026 ROS target to 26%, exceeding the previous target of 24%, citing strong operational efficiencies and early progress in the company's 80/20 initiatives.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CFO Bob Fishman emphasized that 2024 delivered record adjusted EPS of $4.33, a 15% increase, and record free cash flow of $693 million, up 26% year-over-year. He also noted that all three segments—Flow, Water Solutions, and Pool—achieved record ROS.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management introduced full-year 2025 adjusted EPS guidance of $4.65 to $4.80, up 7% to 11%. Sales are expected to remain flat to grow by 2%, with Flow slightly up, Water Solutions flat to slightly down, and Pool up by 4% to 5%.</li> <li>For Q1 2025, adjusted EPS is projected at $1.00 to $1.02, with sales expected to be $975 million to $985 million, down approximately 3% to 4% year-over-year. Management anticipates quarterly sales growth to accelerate starting in Q2 2025.</li> <li>Transformation and 80/20 initiatives are expected to yield $80 million in productivity savings in 2025, driving projected ROS expansion to 24.5% to 25% for the year.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Q4 2024 adjusted EPS reached $1.08, up 24% year-over-year, supported by 370 basis points of ROS expansion to a record 23.8%.</li> <li>Full-year 2024 sales totaled $4.1 billion, down 1%, with adjusted operating income rising 12% to $959 million. The company delivered a record ROS of 23.5%, aided by significant margin improvements across all segments.</li> <li>Pool segment sales grew 5% in Q4 to $354 million, with ROS expanding by 250 basis points to 33.8%. Flow sales declined 5% to $361 million, but ROS improved to 20.4%. Water Solutions sales fell 4% to $258 million, while ROS grew to 24.1%.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q&amp;A</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Brett Linzey, Mizuho, questioned the breakdown of the $80 million in forecasted savings between Transformation and 80/20. CEO Stauch explained that while the benefits are aggregated, 80/20 helps focus on higher-margin growth opportunities by simplifying operations.</li> <li>Julian Mitchell, Barclays, inquired about seasonality and tariff impacts. Stauch noted Q1 challenges due to prior-year inventory buildup and outlined minimal Q1 tariff impacts, with the majority affecting Q2 onward.</li> <li>Jeffrey Hammond, KeyBanc, asked about Pool margin expansion. Stauch highlighted a balanced contribution from pricing, volume, and Transformation-driven efficiencies, with Pool expected to achieve 100 basis points of ROS improvement in 2025.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts displayed cautious optimism, focusing on potential headwinds such as tariffs and delayed industrial projects, while acknowledging the company's strong margin expansion and productivity gains.</li> <li>Management maintained a confident tone in both prepared remarks and Q&amp;A, emphasizing their ability to mitigate risks through strategic initiatives. Positive language included phrases like \"we are confident\" and \"we believe,\" indicating strong conviction in forward guidance.</li> <li>Compared to the prior quarter, management appeared slightly more assertive, driven by upgrades to long-term margin targets and robust Transformation progress.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management increased the 2026 ROS target to 26%, up from 24%, signaling enhanced confidence in long-term operational improvements.</li> <li>Analysts in Q4 focused more on the timing of industrial project recoveries and tariff-related pricing actions, whereas Q3 discussions were more centered on early-stage Transformation execution.</li> <li>Transformation and 80/20 savings accelerated in Q4, with an annualized impact of $100 million compared to $70 million in Q3.</li> <li>Q4 sentiment from management suggested heightened confidence in achieving margin expansion and shareholder returns, reflecting momentum gained during the quarter.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management identified potential risks from higher interest rates affecting residential markets and delayed industrial CapEx projects. Tariffs on products from China and Mexico pose additional cost pressures.</li> <li>Analysts expressed concerns about the pace of recovery in residential and industrial markets, as well as potential supply chain disruptions from geopolitical uncertainties.</li> <li>Mitigation strategies include leveraging pricing actions to offset tariffs, enhancing productivity through Transformation, and accelerating 80/20 efforts to simplify operations.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Pentair delivered another strong quarter, achieving record profitability and cash flow, while expanding margins across all segments. The company raised its 2026 ROS target to 26%, underscoring confidence in accelerated Transformation and 80/20 initiatives. Despite headwinds such as tariffs and sluggish residential markets, management remains optimistic about achieving 2025 adjusted EPS growth of 9% at the midpoint and sustaining long-term shareholder value creation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PNR/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p> </body></html>",

CEO Kalleklev explained that high operational costs of $15,000 per day make steam tankers economically unviable, prompting expected scrapping trends.</li> <li>Analyst, ABN AMRO: Questioned the impact of MEGI and X-DF technologies.

            "description": "<html><body><p>Morgan Stanley Wealth Management (MSWM) is seeing a stall in the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SP500</a>), and said the Federal Reserve halting its run of rate cuts is contributing to a change in the bull-market narrative. <strong></strong></p> <p>The S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SP500</a>) is<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> showing signs of fatigue after climbing ~70% since the bull market took off in 2022, and MSWM said beyond technicals, it’s seeing two fundamentals emerging. One is the Federal Reserve standing pat on interest rates </span><a class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\" href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4400238-federal-reserve-holds-policy-rate-at-425-450\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"after a run of rate cuts\">after a run of rate cuts</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">.

It did not, and investors now need to admit that policy-driven multiples expansion is near its limit, with the driver changing to earnings realization,” MSWM's Chief Investment Officer Lisa Shalett, said in a weekly report. <strong></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Meanwhile, the bull-market narrative has centered on momentum being sustained by U.S. tech innovation and “Magnificent Seven” AI dominance alongside falling interest rates that guide a soft economic landing sustaining momentum, Shalett said. <strong></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">“Last week’s events … strengthened our view that the narrative is shifting and we are entering the 'Great Normalization,' she said. “We assert that it will be dominated by rate and valuation normalization; renewed focus on earnings growth as the driver of equities,” and deconcentration in the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SP500</a>), she said. <strong></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As investor consensus on terminal rates circles around 3.75%-4.0%, so does the upper limit on expansion of multiples, Shalett said. That’s because the level of interest rates and negative equity risk premiums for market-cap leaders “must be acknowledged,” she said.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For investors interested in tracking the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SP500</a>) through ETFs, here are a few: (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"SPDR® S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SH\" title=\"ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF\">SH</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VOO\" title=\"Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF\">VOO</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RSP\" title=\"Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight ETF\">RSP</a>), and (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IVV\" title=\"iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF\">IVV</a>). </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> </p> </body></html>",
