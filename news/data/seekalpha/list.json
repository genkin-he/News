            "description": "<html><body><p>During a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu on Tuesday, President Trump discussed his vision for the future of the Gaza Strip, which included a \"long-term ownership position\" by the United States and the development of the territory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">\"The only reason the Palestinians want to go back to Gaza is they have no alternative. It's right now a demolition site. This is just a demolition site. Virtually every building is down. They instead can occupy all of a beautiful area with homes and safety and they can live out their lives in peace and harmony instead of having to go back and do it again.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">\"I envision a world - people living there, the world's people. I think you'll make that into an international, unbelievable place. I think the potential in the Gaza Strip is unbelievable. And I think the entire world, representatives from all over the world. And they'll live there. Palestinians also. Palestinians will live there, many people will live there. But they've tried the other and they've tried it for decades and decades and decades. It's not going to work it work. It didn't work. It will never work. And you have to learn from history. History has - you know, you just can't let it keep repeating itself.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">\"We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out. Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area. Do a real job, do something different. We're going to take over that peace and we're going to develop it, create thousands and thousands of jobs. And it will be something that the entire Middle East can be very proud of,\" Trump told reporters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">\"Everybody feels that continuing the same process that's gone on forever over and over again, and then it starts, and then the killing starts, and all of the other problems start, and you end up in the same place and we don't want to see that happen. So, by the United States, with its stability and strength, owning it, especially the strength that we're developing and developed over the last fairly short period of time, I would say really since the election, I think we'll be a great keeper of something that is very, very strong, very powerful and very, very good for the area, not just for Israel, for the entire Middle East. It's very important and we'll again have thousands of jobs. And there will be jobs for everyone, not for a specific group of people, but for everybody.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">\"We have an opportunity to do something that could be phenomenal. And I don't want to be cute. I don't want to be a wise guy. But the 'Riviera of the Middle East,' this could be something that could be so magnificent. But more importantly than that is the people that have been absolutely destroyed that live there now can live in peace in a much better situation because they are living in hell. And those people will now be able to live in peace. We'll make sure that it's done world-class.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em><strong>Dear readers:</strong></em><strong> </strong>We recognize that politics often intersects with the financial news of the day, so we invite you to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4752437-politics-and-the-markets-020525\" title=\"click here\">click here</a> to join the separate political discussion.</p> </body></html>",
