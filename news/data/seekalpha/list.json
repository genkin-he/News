Total segment operating profit for Q4 reached $1.1B, with<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> full-year operating profit at $4.2B.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Luciano emphasized operational improvements, such as record crush volumes in LATAM and enhanced performance in Starches &amp; Sweeteners, which achieved 3% higher production year-over-year. Two flavors acquisitions were successfully integrated, contributing to the EMEA region's performance.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ADM announced targeted cost reductions of $500M to $750M over the next three to five years, including $200M to $300M planned for 2025. This involves reducing 600 to 700 roles, realigning efforts, and identifying structural savings.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company disclosed $2B in portfolio simplification opportunities, including potential divestitures and closures of underperforming assets or those with excess capacity.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CFO Monish Patolawala noted that while Q4 played out as expected, December faced pressure from unfavorable crush margins and higher manufacturing costs. The AS&amp;O segment operating profit declined by 32% year-over-year.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management expects a challenging first-half of 2025, with significantly lower soybean and canola crush margins. Soybean crush margins are projected between $45 to $55 per ton, down $5 per ton year-over-year, while canola crush margins are expected to range from $50 to $70 per ton, down $20 per ton.</li> <li>Patolawala stated that operational improvements and cost savings are expected to mitigate some market headwinds. For the full year, AS&amp;O segment performance is anticipated to be \"below to similar\" to 2024 levels.</li> <li>Nutrition segment operating profits are forecasted to improve in 2025, driven by stronger performance in Flavors and Animal Nutrition, alongside cost optimization. However, Q1 2025 is expected to remain under pressure due to ongoing challenges at the Decatur East facility.</li> <li>Adjusted EPS for 2025 is projected between $4.00 and $4.75, reflecting lower margins but offset by $200M to $300M in cost savings.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Q4 adjusted EPS was $1.14, slightly below analysts' estimates of $1.15. Revenues for the quarter were not explicitly mentioned in the transcript.</li> <li>The AS&amp;O segment reported a Q4 operating profit of $644M, down 32% year-over-year, driven by weaker crush margins and higher costs. Full-year operating profit for the segment fell 40% compared to 2023.</li> <li>Carbohydrate Solutions' Q4 operating profit was flat year-over-year, supported by robust demand for ethanol and strong North American starches and sweeteners margins, partially offset by weaker EMEA results.</li> <li>Nutrition achieved Q4 operating profit of $88M, supported by improved mix and insurance recoveries. However, organic revenues in the segment declined due to demand challenges and higher manufacturing costs.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q&amp;A</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Tom Palmer, Citi: Questioned the expected recovery in nutrition profits in 2025. CEO Luciano explained that improvements would stem from the Decatur East facility resuming operations, strong growth in Flavors and Biotics, and margin improvements in Animal Nutrition.</li> <li>Andrew Strelzik, BMO: Asked about vegetable oil demand post-45Z guidance. Luciano noted expectations of a 5% increase in soybean oil's share of feedstock while emphasizing policy clarity's importance for stabilizing margins.</li> <li>Ben Theurer, Barclays: Sought clarification on the AS&amp;O segment’s expected Q1 decline. CFO Patolawala cited lower crush margins and reduced insurance proceeds but highlighted operational efficiencies expected to improve results later in the year.</li> <li>Heather Jones, Heather Jones Research: Inquired about potential cost recoveries in 2025. Patolawala estimated insurance proceeds would range between $50M to $100M in 2025 from the Decatur East incident.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts expressed concerns over weak Q1 projections and the impact of policy uncertainties, highlighting skepticism about margin recoveries and operational headwinds.</li> <li>Management maintained a cautiously optimistic tone, emphasizing internal cost controls, portfolio simplification, and operational improvements as key levers for navigating a challenging environment.</li> <li>Compared to the previous quarter, management displayed consistent confidence in addressing operational inefficiencies, while analysts remained focused on unresolved headwinds and policy-related risks.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Guidance for adjusted EPS was narrowed to $4.00-$4.75 for 2025, reflecting a more conservative outlook compared to the $4.50-$5.00 guidance from Q3 2024.</li> <li>Management’s focus shifted towards identifying $2B in portfolio opportunities, a new strategic initiative not emphasized in the prior quarter.</li> <li>The tone during Q4 was slightly more defensive, with management highlighting uncertainties in biofuel policies and trade environments compared to the broader optimism expressed in Q3.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Trade policy uncertainties with China and Canada could impact crush margins and export volumes.</li> <li>Regulatory ambiguities surrounding biofuel policies, including the 45Z guidance, add volatility to soybean oil demand.</li> <li>Ongoing operational challenges at the Decatur East facility continue to weigh on the Nutrition segment.</li> <li>Lower insurance recoveries in 2025 and cost pressures from inflation and manufacturing inefficiencies pose additional risks.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">ADM is navigating a challenging operating environment with a focus on cost management, operational improvements, and strategic portfolio simplification. While near-term headwinds, including weaker margins and policy uncertainties, weigh on the outlook, management’s emphasis on $2B in portfolio opportunities and targeted cost savings of up to $750M positions the company for long-term shareholder value creation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ADM/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p> </body></html>",

Performance Chemicals is expected to maintain quarterly EBIT in the $45 million to $55 million range.</li> <li>Demand for infrastructure-related products, especially in wind energy and power distribution cables, is projected to drive growth, while auto-related sales are expected to align with flat global tire production levels.</li> <li>The company anticipates a gradual ramp-up of its Indonesia Reinforcement Materials capacity in the latter half of FY2025, with significant contributions expected in FY2026.</li> <li>Tariffs on US-Mexico-China trade are being assessed.

Keohane indicated adjustments in spot pricing to maintain margins while emphasizing the company’s track record of margin management.</li> <li>Lydia Huang, J.P.

Concerns centered on competitive pressures in the Americas and the outlook for tire production.</li> <li>Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, emphasizing strategic execution and growth opportunities.

Q1 2025 results were stronger than Q4 2024, which had higher maintenance costs.</li> <li>Management's tone reflected continued confidence in strategic execution. Analysts maintained focus on competitive dynamics and cost pressures, similar to prior discussions.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Challenges include the impact of Asian tire imports on North American volumes, potential downstream effects from new tariffs, and competitive pressures in Reinforcement Materials.</li> <li>Management emphasized operational excellence and geographic diversification as mitigation strategies.

Organic volume declined<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> 5% due to tough year-over-year comparisons.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Waltz noted the company remains on track with growth initiatives related to water and global construction services, with planned contributions later in the year to support PVC and HDPE water products. He emphasized a focus on mitigating pricing pressures and advancing strategic initiatives to expand into new markets.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Management reduced their full-year adjusted EBITDA outlook to a midpoint of $400 million, down from previous estimates, citing larger-than-anticipated impacts from competitive pricing pressures in PVC and steel conduit markets.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CFO John Deitzer provided additional insights, stating that average selling prices decreased by 12% in Q1, primarily driven by PVC and steel conduit products, and outlined steps to manage costs and improve operational efficiency.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management provided Q2 guidance with net sales expected between $685 million and $715 million, adjusted EBITDA of $85 million to $95 million, and adjusted EPS of $1.30 to $1.50. For FY 2025, full-year adjusted EBITDA is projected in the range of $375 million to $425 million, with adjusted EPS between $5.75 and $6.85.</li> <li>Waltz mentioned that the company expects a stronger performance in the second half of FY 2025 due to seasonal construction activity and ramping up of growth initiatives.

Bill Waltz explained that PVC imports grew over 20% year-over-year and emphasized that the pricing pressures are factored into the revised guidance, which assumes market normalization to pre-COVID levels by year-end.</li> <li>Deane Dray, RBC, inquired about the drivers of the guidance cut and the contribution of PVC versus steel. CFO Deitzer clarified that approximately 75% of the pricing impact comes from PVC, with the remainder from steel conduit. Waltz added that additional domestic PVC capacity and imports have further pressured prices.</li> <li>Chris Moore, CJS Securities, asked about the fiscal 2025 bottoming outlook. Waltz highlighted ongoing productivity improvements, growth in water-related products, and contributions from global mega projects as key drivers for recovery.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts displayed a slightly negative tone, focusing on pricing pressures and the competitive landscape, particularly in PVC and steel conduit markets.

On the buyback front, Disney also set a target of $3 billion for the fiscal year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Even though, analysts are positive on Disney’s Entertainment unit, many are focusing on the company’s Experiences segment, given the impact from hurricanes Helene and Milton and cruise ship pre-opening costs. The company also faced a slowdown in attendance after a post-covid surge.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">BofA analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich said he projects Q1 to be “the trough quarter of this fiscal year,” adding that it does not appear the recent Los Angeles fires have had a material impact on Disneyland attendance until now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">“We project a mid-single digit decline in F1Q25 (-5%) weighed down by Hurricane impacts and pre-opening costs for the Disney Treasure, improving to +4% in F2Q and full year growth of 7%,” noted Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris, while talking about the Experiences segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Disney Treasure is a cruise ship that began its maiden voyage in December last year. Disney cruises are part of the company’s experiences division, alongside theme parks, resorts and consumer products. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Over the last two years, Disney <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS/earnings/eps-surprise-summary\">has beaten EPS estimates</a> 88% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 50% of the time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Wall Street and Seeking Alpha analysts are <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS/ratings/quant-ratings#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews\">bullish</a> and recommended the company as a Buy, while Seeking Alpha’s Quant Ratings rated it as a Hold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Over the last three months, EPS estimates have seen 13 <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS/earnings/revisions\">upward revisions</a> compared to three downward revisions.

This deadly strain of H5N1 has led to the culling of millions of chickens since 2022, severely impacting the egg supply chain. As of January 2025, more than 134 million birds have been affected in the United States, which has thrown the supply and demand balance out of whack.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The latest guidance from the USDA was that egg prices are likely to push even higher in 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In a sign of the times, Georgia-based Waffle House has added a temporary surcharge of $0.50 per egg at its ~2,100 locations due to the elevated egg prices from the bird flu outbreak. \"The continuing egg shortage caused by HPAI (Bird Flu) has caused a dramatic increase in egg prices,\" noted Waffle House in a statement. \"Consumers and restaurants are being forced to make difficult decisions.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Meanwhile, grocery store operators Albertsons Companies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACI\" title=\"Albertsons Companies, Inc.\">ACI</a>), Kroger (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KR\" title=\"The Kroger Co.\">KR</a></span>), Sprouts Farmers Markets (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SFM\" title=\"Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc.\">SFM</a>), Ingles Markets (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IMKTA\" title=\"Ingles Markets, Incorporated\">IMKTA</a>), Weis Markets (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMK\" title=\"Weis Markets, Inc.\">WMK</a>), Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NGVC\" title=\"Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage, Inc.\">NGVC</a>), and Whole Foods (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) have all raised prices </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Egg prices are also very relevant to producer Cal-Maine Foods (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CALM\" title=\"Cal-Maine Foods, Inc.\">CALM</a></span>), which has seen a 91% share price rally over the last 52 weeks.
