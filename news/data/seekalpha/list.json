            "description": "<html><body><p>Earnings Call Insights: Everest Group (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EG\" title=\"Everest Group, Ltd.\">EG</a></span>) Q4 2024 </p> <h3>Management View</h3> <ul> <li>CEO Jim Williamson highlighted a pre-tax net loss estimate of $350 million to $450 million from the California wildfires, primarily affecting the reinsurance division. He emphasized the company's underwriting discipline, noting that Everest's loss reflects<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> careful client selection. </span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Operating income for 2024 reached $1.3 billion, with a 9% return on equity despite $1.7 billion in reserve strengthening, predominantly in U.S. casualty lines. Williamson described the results as demonstrating the business's resilience, supported by strong income streams from reinsurance and investments.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Reinsurance premium growth of 12.6% during Q4 was driven by property lines and selective specialty expansion, offset by a 7% reduction in U.S. casualty treaty business. Williamson stated that the company walked away from $750 million in North American casualty quota share business since January 1, 2024.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The insurance segment saw a casualty premium reduction of 23%, with remediation efforts targeting underperforming accounts. Key wins included multiline and large deductible casualty programs for sophisticated clients.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CFO Mark Kociancic reported gross written premiums of $4.7 billion, representing 7.2% growth. The combined ratio was 135.5%, impacted by 37.6 points of prior-year reserve development.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Williamson noted that Everest's strategic focus would remain on underwriting discipline, particularly in casualty lines where loss cost trends remain elevated. The company is not entering new markets in 2025 but plans to scale operations in its existing 12 international markets.</li> <li>Reinsurance pricing is expected to stabilize or improve following recent catastrophic events, particularly in property catastrophe and European markets. Williamson expects the California wildfires to reinforce pricing discipline in property reinsurance.</li> <li>CFO Kociancic reaffirmed the company's mid-teens total shareholder return target over the cycle, emphasizing capital strength and the potential for share repurchases.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>The combined ratio for Q4 reached 135.5%, reflecting $1.5 billion of prior-year unfavorable reserve development. Current accident year losses contributed $229 million, driven by Hurricane Milton.</li> <li>Reinsurance achieved a combined ratio of 90.4%, with property cat excess of loss growing 26.2% for the year. Attritional combined ratio improved by 140 basis points to 83.7%, excluding profit commissions.</li> <li>Insurance gross written premiums declined 1.6%, reflecting casualty remediation offset by 30% growth in property and specialty lines. The attritional loss ratio for insurance increased to 84%, reflecting current accident year strengthening.</li> <li>Net investment income increased to $473 million during Q4, driven by higher assets under management and book yield stability at 4.7%.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q&amp;A</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Gregory Peters, Raymond James: Asked about managing volatility given the shift to international property business. Williamson emphasized disciplined capital deployment and reinsurance strategies to manage per-risk volatility.</li> <li>Meyer Shields, Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods: Inquired about loss ratio progress in the insurance segment. Williamson pointed to prudent reserve actions and improving portfolio mix as tailwinds.</li> <li>Alex Scott, Barclays: Asked about the impact of California wildfires on pricing. Williamson expects this event to reinforce pricing discipline globally, particularly in property catastrophe.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts expressed moderate concern over reserve strengthening and loss cost trends in U.S. casualty lines but recognized the company's proactive approach.</li> <li>Management maintained a confident tone, particularly in highlighting underwriting discipline and resilience in navigating market conditions. Williamson frequently emphasized strategic actions to improve profitability.</li> <li>Compared to Q3, analysts' tone was slightly more pressing, focusing on reserve adequacy and future casualty trends. Management showed consistent confidence but was more cautious in addressing potential risks in U.S. casualty lines.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Guidance language shifted to emphasize discipline in casualty underwriting and a narrower focus on international market scaling.</li> <li>Reserve strengthening in Q4 was significantly higher than in Q3, reflecting heightened prudence in U.S. casualty lines.</li> <li>Analysts' focus moved from broad operational performance in Q3 to reserve adequacy and casualty remediation in Q4.</li> <li>Management tone remained firm, but there was a more defensive posture regarding reserve adjustments.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Elevated loss cost inflation in U.S. casualty lines remains a key challenge, with assumed trends exceeding 12% in general liability, auto liability, and umbrella lines.</li> <li>Analysts raised concerns about reserve adequacy and the potential for further strengthening in casualty lines.</li> <li>Management noted strategic exits from underperforming accounts and emphasized continued focus on rate adequacy and portfolio mix improvement.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Everest Group's Q4 2024 results underscore its focus on underwriting discipline and portfolio remediation, particularly in U.S. casualty lines. While reserve strengthening impacted the quarter, the company demonstrated resilience through growth in reinsurance and specialty lines. Management remains optimistic about achieving mid-teens shareholder returns, supported by strong capital positioning, targeted growth in international markets, and anticipated stabilization in property reinsurance pricing. Investors should monitor ongoing reserve trends and the impact of casualty remediation efforts on profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EG/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p> </body></html>",

China's reaction was in stark contrast to Canada and Mexico, with the two North American nations showing a willingness to work with Trump.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">\"While markets may be inclined to read across from negotiating successes the U.S. had with Mexico and Canada, we think a lot is different in the U.S.-China trade relationship. A much more existential imbalance lies behind U.S. trade angst with China, which the Trump administration now seems keen to correct,\" Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">\"While the U.S. accounts for 29% of global consumption, it produces only 15% of the world's goods. Meanwhile, China accounts for 32% of global manufacturing but just 12% of consumption.

This is now causing consternation in the West, with China making strides in many high-value added capital goods,\" Reid said. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">China's disruptive power was on full display last week in the form of artificial intelligence (AI) startup DeepSeek and the hype around its low-cost language model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">\"While the U.S. is still the second-largest goods producer, it has less than half of China's global share, with many U.S. allies also seeing significant drops in their manufacturing share over the past 30 years.
