For the full year, EBITDA<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> grew 15% to $390 million, with margins rising 270 basis points to 24.9%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $55 million, totaling $272 million for 2024.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Adams noted the company repurchased $20 million in shares during the quarter, contributing to a full-year total of $150 million at an average price below $32. The company also allocated $20 million to top off its pension plan, with plans to exit it by the end of 2025.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CFO David Pauli reported Q4 sales of $371 million, reflecting 4% year-over-year growth. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter reached $91 million, with strong margin expansion driven by productivity initiatives and Elkay-related synergies. Net debt leverage ended the year at a low 0.8x, enabling significant capital allocation flexibility.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management expects 2025 core sales growth similar to 2024, adjusted EBITDA in the range of $405 million to $420 million, and free cash flow of approximately $290 million. </li> <li>For Q1 2025, the company projects low single-digit core sales growth and adjusted EBITDA margins of 24.5% to 25%. </li> <li>Pauli emphasized proactive monitoring of tariff uncertainties, noting the company has reduced its exposure to materials from China to less than 10% by the end of 2026.

Full-year adjusted EBITDA stood at $390 million, with margins improving by 270 basis points to 24.9%.</li> <li>Free cash flow for 2024 totaled $272 million, exceeding prior guidance, while $150 million was deployed for share repurchases.</li> <li>The company achieved 4% year-over-year core sales growth in Q4, driven by strength in non-residential end markets, partially offset by softness in residential and parts of the commercial segment.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q&amp;A</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Bryan Blair, Oppenheimer: Asked about first and second-half dynamics across end markets.

Adams clarified that institutional growth projections align with Dodge Starts, with significant benefits expected in 2026 as starts materialize.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts expressed cautious optimism, particularly regarding institutional growth potential and M&amp;A opportunities in 2025. Questions about tariffs and macroeconomic impacts reflected slight concerns about external uncertainties.</li> <li>Management maintained a confident and proactive tone, emphasizing operational efficiencies, strong capital allocation flexibility, and strategic focus areas. CEO Todd Adams frequently highlighted the company's ability to adapt to challenges.</li> <li>Compared to the previous quarter, analysts' tone remained consistent but focused more on potential tariff impacts and their implications. Management maintained a similar level of confidence, with no significant changes in tone or sentiment.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Both quarters reported 4% core growth, but Q4 saw stronger focus on free cash flow performance, with $272 million for the full year, compared to Q3's $87 million in the quarter.</li> <li>Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q4 were slightly lower at 24.6% versus 25.6% in Q3. However, the full-year margin expansion of 270 basis points exceeded the 250-270 basis point guidance provided in Q3.</li> <li>Management's tone remained consistent, with continued emphasis on productivity, margin expansion, and capital allocation flexibility.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Potential tariff impacts remain a key uncertainty for 2025. Management noted their preparedness to implement price increases and adjust supply chain strategies as needed.</li> <li>Elevated interest rates were raised as a potential medium-to-long-term risk. Management stated that most of their business is insulated from interest rate sensitivity but acknowledged the broader macroeconomic impacts.</li> <li>Analysts also questioned potential delays or hesitancy in project starts, though management reported no significant pushouts.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Zurn Elkay reported solid Q4 results, with 4% core growth and continued margin expansion driven by productivity initiatives.

Cloud has been the driver of revenue growth in recent quarters and continued in the fourth quarter, up 16% year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The analysts added that Juniper enters 2025 with improving momentum in the business, but investor focus remains on the close of the acquisition by Hewlett Packard, which remains pending following the DOJ complaint.</p> </body></html>",

            "description": "<html><body><p>Despite heightened volatility due to macroeconomic events toward the end of January, capital markets ended the month on a high note, with global stocks, bonds, and commodities posting gains. This positive momentum was reflected in a surge of capital flowing into exchange traded funds, which saw<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> their largest-ever inflow for the month.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In total, ETFs took in a staggering $92B in January, marking a 142% increase compared to the typical $39B monthly average. The bulk of these gains were concentrated in U.S. equity ETFs, which accounted for $40B—approximately 90% of all equity ETF inflows. Within the equity space, sector-focused ETFs saw notable inflows, with $10B entering sectors, most notably Financials and Technology, which together garnered $9B. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Bond ETFs also experienced a robust influx of capital, drawing $37B in inflows—the second largest on record. A significant portion of this came from risk-on credit sectors, including a record $7B into bank loan and collateralized loan obligation (CLO) ETFs. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Perhaps one of the most noteworthy trends was the performance of active ETFs, which experienced a record-breaking $43B in inflows. This was driven by unprecedented demand in both active equity and active fixed income products, signaling a growing appetite for more hands-on, dynamic investment strategies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As markets continue to rally, investor confidence appears to be strengthening, and ETF flows reflect the broader optimism surrounding global economy. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlined below are the world’s 20 largest exchange traded funds, ranked by assets under management: </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 20: Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VXUS\" title=\"Vanguard Total International Stock ETF\">VXUS</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 19: SPDR Gold Shares (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLD\" title=\"SPDR Gold Trust ETF\">GLD</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 18: iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IEMG\" title=\"iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF\">IEMG</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 17: Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VWO\" title=\"Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF\">VWO</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 16: Vanguard Information Technology ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VGT\" title=\"Vanguard Information Technology ETF\">VGT</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 15: Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VIG\" title=\"Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF\">VIG</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 14: iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IJR\" title=\"iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF\">IJR</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 13: iShares Core S&amp;P Mid-Cap ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IJH\" title=\"iShares Core S&amp;P MidCap ETF\">IJH</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 12: iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWF\" title=\"iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF\">IWF</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 11: iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AGG\" title=\"iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF\">AGG</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 10: Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BND\" title=\"Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF\">BND</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 9: iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IEFA\" title=\"BlackRock Institutional Trust Company N.A. - BTC iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF\">IEFA</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 8: Vanguard Value ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VTV\" title=\"Vanguard Value ETF\">VTV</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 7: Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VEA\" title=\"Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF\">VEA</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 6: Vanguard Growth ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VUG\" title=\"Vanguard Growth ETF\">VUG</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 5: Invesco QQQ Trust Series I (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ\" title=\"Invesco QQQ Trust ETF\">QQQ</a></span></span>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 4: Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VTI\" title=\"Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF\">VTI</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 3: iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSEARCA:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IVV\" title=\"iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF\">IVV</a></span></span>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 2: Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSEARCA:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VOO\" title=\"Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF\">VOO</a></span></span>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">No. 1: SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSEARCA:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"SPDR® S&amp;P 500® ETF Trust\">SPY</a></span></span>)</p> </body></html>",
