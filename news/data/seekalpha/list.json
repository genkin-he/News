Media and Precision Marketing continued to drive growth in both quarters.</li> <li>Margins were flat year-over-year in both Q3 and Q4, as ongoing investments in technology and new business integrations offset efficiency gains.</li> <li>Analysts' focus shifted from general performance in Q3 to specific concerns about 2025 guidance and post-merger synergies in Q4.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management highlighted potential macroeconomic and policy challenges, particularly related to U.S. government changes and their impact on key sectors.</li> <li>Analysts raised questions about the pace of integration for Flywheel and IPG, along with the potential for cost overruns in planned investments.</li> <li>Foreign currency translation remains a near-term headwind, projected to reduce Q1 2025 revenue by 2%-2.5%.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Omnicom delivered strong Q4 results, exceeding full-year organic growth guidance and maintaining flat margins despite significant investments.
