The USPS said it is working closely with the Customs and Border Protection agency to implement an<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> efficient collection mechanism for the new China tariffs to ensure the least disruption to package delivery.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The announcement arrived just hours after the USPS had suspended service for the regions. The USPS decision does not impact the additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods or the closing of the \"de minimis\" trading loophole.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The de minimis trade exemption is a provision in U.S. trade law that allows packages valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free and with minimal customs inspection. The exemption, which has been in place since the 1930s, has attracted significant attention lately due to its widespread use by e-commerce companies, particularly those based in China.</p> </body></html>",
