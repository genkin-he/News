She also highlighted a decline in the compensation ratio to 67.9% in Q4 and expects further reductions in 2025.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Taubman mentioned that restructuring activity remains robust, with the business ranking number one in announced restructurings globally and in the U.S. He expects this elevated activity to persist, reflecting a multiyear cycle of liability management.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Strategic advisory achieved record revenues in 2024, with significant market share gains attributed to expanded industry and geographic coverage, enhanced capabilities, and stronger brand recognition.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management projects higher global M&amp;A activity in 2025 as conditions normalize, driven by improving macroeconomic factors and increasing corporate appetite for strategic transactions. Taubman expressed confidence in continued growth for the strategic advisory business, supported by a strengthened platform and expanded client relationships.</li> <li>The firm anticipates challenges in primary fundraising for 2025 but expects secular growth for the private capital solutions business.

All three business segments—restructuring, strategic advisory, and PJT Park Hill—delivered record revenues.</li> <li>Adjusted non-compensation expenses for 2024 were $185M, up 12% year-over-year, driven by higher occupancy and travel costs alongside continued investment in technology.</li> <li>The firm declared a dividend of $0.25 per share, payable on March 19, 2025.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q&amp;A</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Devin Ryan, Citizens JMP Securities, inquired about partner productivity and strategic advisory potential. CEO Taubman responded that while productivity improvement is tied to macro conditions, the firm sees significant upside in strategic advisory, the least mature of its businesses.</li> <li>James Yaro, Goldman Sachs, asked about M&amp;A activity in Europe versus the U.S. Taubman highlighted a potential uptick in European activity, citing valuation disconnects and the need for consolidation among European companies.</li> <li>Marc Palucci, UBS, sought clarity on restructuring growth. Taubman stated that restructuring remains highly active and is expected to sustain strong performance into 2025, driven by elevated debt levels and macroeconomic uncertainties.</li> <li>Brendan O'Brien, Wolfe Research, questioned the timeline for M&amp;A normalization. Taubman noted that while January data may be misleading due to seasonality, he expects accelerating activity as 2025 progresses, emphasizing a multiyear recovery trend.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts raised concerns about macroeconomic uncertainties and the pace of M&amp;A recovery.
