Significant contributions came from the Katsa Oy acquisition, which expanded the company’s engineering capabilities and global footprint. Batten<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> emphasized the importance of cross-selling opportunities and optimizing shared cost efficiencies.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Marine and Propulsion sales grew 23.9% year-over-year, driven by robust demand for Veth products, particularly in electric, hybrid, and conventional propulsion systems. Increased government defense spending also supported demand for patrol boats in response to geopolitical conflicts.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Land-based transmissions saw a 19.8% year-over-year increase, supported by demand for advanced configurations in the airport rescue and firefighting transmission business. The industrial segment posted 44.8% growth, benefiting from both the Katsa acquisition and a rebound in Lufkin orders.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CFO Jeff Knutson reported a 5% increase in gross profit to $21.7 million but noted a decline in gross profit margins from 28.3% to 24.1%, primarily due to inventory write-downs and unfavorable product mix.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Knutson stated, \"Operating cash generation of $4.3 million was strong in the quarter, and EBITDA increased to $6.3 million, up 13.5% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024.\"</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management remains optimistic about sustained growth, citing a healthy backlog across end markets despite a sequential and year-over-year decline due to high shipments. Batten stated the focus will remain on \"disciplined inventory management\" and exploring additional strategic acquisitions.</li> <li>Continued emphasis on electrification and hybrid propulsion systems was highlighted as a key growth driver, with Batten noting that these efforts position Twin Disc to address evolving customer needs.</li> <li>Knutson outlined a capital expenditure outlook of $12 million to $14 million for the fiscal year and reaffirmed the goal of converting 60% of EBITDA to free cash flow, though he acknowledged it might be a stretch due to challenges in Q1.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Revenue for the second quarter reached $89.3 million, up 23.2% from the prior year, with $10 million attributed to the Katsa acquisition. On an organic basis, revenue increased by 10.1%.</li> <li>Net income for the quarter was $900,000, or $0.07 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $900,000, or ($0.07) per share, in Q2 2024.</li> <li>Gross margin decreased by 420 basis points year-over-year due to inventory rationalization costs associated with Katsa, along with unfavorable product mix.</li> <li>EBITDA improved to $6.3 million, an increase of 13.5% from Q2 2024. Operating cash flow reached $4.3 million, reflecting disciplined cost management.</li> <li>Net debt increased to $9 million, driven by the acquisition of Katsa, and the company ended the quarter with $15.9 million in cash.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q&amp;A</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Simon Wong, Gabelli Funds: \"Can you quantify how much of your oil and gas business was down year-over-year?\" CFO Jeff Knutson: \"It was about a little under 8% of revenue for the quarter and down about 24% compared to the prior year Q2.\"</li> <li>Wong: \"Is the increased quoting activity in oil and gas primarily from North America?\" Knutson: \"It's both North America, Asia, and also some South American activity.\"</li> <li>Wong: \"Are you still targeting 60% EBITDA conversion to free cash flow?\" Knutson: \"Yes, though it might be a stretch this year given Q1 challenges, but we’re on a good trend now following Q2.\"</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts expressed cautious optimism, focusing on oil and gas segment declines, free cash flow targets, and R&amp;D commercialization timelines. Their tone was neutral to slightly positive as they sought clarity on growth areas and operational challenges.</li> <li>Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, highlighting strategic initiatives and operational progress. In the Q&amp;A, Knutson's responses were measured but optimistic, acknowledging challenges while emphasizing recovery and future opportunities.</li> <li>Compared to the previous quarter, management appeared more upbeat regarding operational improvements, though analysts maintained similar levels of caution.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Revenue grew significantly from $72.9 million in Q1 to $89.3 million in Q2, driven by stronger contributions from Katsa and improved demand for Veth products.</li> <li>Gross margin declined from 26.5% in Q1 to 24.1% in Q2 due to inventory write-downs and unfavorable product mix.</li> <li>Analysts' focus shifted from inventory buildup in Q1 to free cash flow targets and oil and gas segment challenges in Q2.</li> <li>Management's tone improved from acknowledging Q1 challenges to emphasizing recovery and strategic progress in Q2.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management cited macroeconomic headwinds in the Asia-Pacific region and subdued oil and gas new builds in North America as ongoing challenges.</li> <li>Gross margin pressures from inventory rationalization and unfavorable product mix were highlighted as key financial risks.</li> <li>Analysts raised concerns about the company’s ability to meet free cash flow targets and the pace of recovery in oil and gas markets.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Twin Disc reported strong revenue growth in Q2 2025, backed by the Katsa acquisition and robust demand for marine and propulsion products. While gross margins faced pressure from inventory rationalization and product mix, the company emphasized operational improvements and strategic investments in electrification and hybrid systems. Free cash flow targets remain a challenge, but management expressed confidence in achieving long-term growth through disciplined cost management and market expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TWIN/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p> </body></html>",
