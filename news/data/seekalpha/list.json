Chinese markets are still closed for the New Year holiday.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">\"In addition to swings for the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar, the US dollar strength came as the Euro weakened,\" Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The Euro against the U.S. dollar was down 0.15% to 1.0326 on fears that Trump could levy tariffs on the European Union next. </p> </body></html>",
