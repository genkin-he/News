            "description": "<html><body><p>Piper Sandler said Juniper Networks' (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\">NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JNPR\" title=\"Juniper Networks, Inc.\">JNPR</a></span>) stock will likely continue trading at a discount due to the U.S. Department of Justice's concerns over the potential acquisition by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HPE\" title=\"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company\">HPE</a>), but fundamentals are showing an improvement. </p> <p>The firm maintained<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> its Neutral outlook on Juniper and $40 price target. On Tuesday, Juniper </span><a class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\" href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4403111-juniper-networks-non-gaap-eps-of-0_64-beats-by-0_07-revenue-of-1_4b-beats-by-10m\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"reported\">reported</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> its fourth quarter </span><a class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\" href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4403038-juniper-tops-q4-estimates-as-it-intends-to-pursue-merger-with-hpe\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"results\">results</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">, which beat estimates, and the company and Hewlett Packard will defend the transaction and remain fully committed to completing it. The remarks came on the heels of the DOJ's announcing last week that it has </span><a class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\" href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4400880-juniper-networks-sinks-after-doj-sues-to-block-14b-sale-to-hewlett-packard-enterprise#hasComeFromMpArticle\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"sued\">sued</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> to block Hewlett Packard's potential $14B acquisition of the rival wireless networking technology provider, Juniper, on competition concerns. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Analysts led by James Fish said Juniper reported slight top-line upside that their checks suggested, which was complemented with the largest operational upside over the last nearly five years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The analysts added that Juniper faced easy comps (with first half 2025 facing even easier compares), but the underlying metrics indicate some year-end budget flush, datacenter refresh picking up, Cloud and AI demand, and Mist demand holding strong, all of which echo signals from other vendors and is another good sign for networking names yet to report.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Fish and his team noted that they were most impressed that the backlog grew 30% year-over-year and seemingly was built throughout the course of the year, suggesting further strengthahead (particularly with Cloud customers).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">UBS also kept its Neutral rating on Juniper with a $40 price target on the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Analyst David Vogt and his team said Juniper returned to growth in the fourth quarter after five quarters of decline, with revenue up 3% year-over-year on strong cloud results. Cloud has been the driver of revenue growth in recent quarters and continued in the fourth quarter, up 16% year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The analysts added that Juniper enters 2025 with improving momentum in the business, but investor focus remains on the close of the acquisition by Hewlett Packard, which remains pending following the DOJ complaint.</p> </body></html>",
