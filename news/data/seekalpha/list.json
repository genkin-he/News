He noted a 12% growth in FFO per share and a 19% growth<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> in AFFO per share over the last three years. The company's 2025 guidance reflects additional growth potential.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The merger with Physicians Realty has been highly successful, with substantial synergies and a robust development pipeline. The company aims to deploy $500 million in investments in 2025, including opportunities in life sciences and outpatient medical sectors.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Brinker emphasized the company's plans to internalize property management across its portfolio, which is expected to deliver financial and strategic benefits. </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CFO Peter Scott reported strong Q4 results, with adjusted FFO per share at $0.46 and AFFO per share at $0.40. He highlighted a balance sheet with a net debt-to-EBITDA of 5.2x, positioning the company to capitalize on market opportunities.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>The company forecasts adjusted FFO for 2025 to range between $1.81 and $1.87 per share, with total same-store growth expected at 3% to 4%. </li> <li>Segment-level guidance includes outpatient medical growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, lab growth of 3% to 4%, and CCRCs growth of 4% to 8%. </li> <li>Planned investments in 2025 include $500 million with a weighted average yield of 8% or higher, focusing on lab loan investments and outpatient pre-leased developments.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>For Q4, Healthpeak Properties reported 5.4% same-store growth across the total portfolio. Segment-specific performance included 3.2% growth in outpatient medical, 5% in labs, and 20.8% in CCRCs.</li> <li>Full-year results included adjusted FFO of $1.81 per share and AFFO of $1.60 per share, exceeding the midpoint of initial guidance by $0.05.</li> <li>The company executed 6.2 million square feet of outpatient medical leases and 2 million square feet of lab leases during the year, achieving rent mark-to-market rates of 7% and 11%, respectively.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q&amp;A</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Nick Yulico, Deutsche Bank: Asked about lab leasing pipeline and progress on specific projects. CEO Brinker noted over 300,000 square feet under LOI and significant ongoing activity, with over 50% of targeted cash NOI already achieved.</li> <li>Juan Sanabria, BMO Capital Markets: Inquired about the $500 million investment plan for 2025. CFO Scott explained the allocation between life sciences and outpatient medical, with most projects being accretive loans or development opportunities.</li> <li>Austin Wurschmidt, KeyBanc Capital Markets: Sought clarification on deceleration in same-store growth guidance. CFO Scott attributed it to internalization benefits realized in 2024 and a more conservative outlook for CCRCs.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts raised concerns about market conditions in life sciences and outpatient medical sectors but generally acknowledged the company's strategic positioning and growth initiatives. Their tone was neutral to slightly positive.</li> <li>Management conveyed confidence in their growth strategies, emphasizing financial strength and competitive advantages. The tone during prepared remarks was positive, though slightly defensive when addressing near-term challenges in life sciences.</li> <li>Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management maintained a consistent level of confidence, with a notable focus on execution and future opportunities.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Guidance for adjusted FFO was tightened, reflecting a narrower range for 2025 compared to upward revisions in Q3. Same-store growth projections were reduced slightly from 5.4% in Q4 to a range of 3% to 4%.</li> <li>Strategic focus shifted towards capital deployment in life sciences through structured investments and development projects, contrasting with the Q3 emphasis on merger synergies.</li> <li>Analysts' focus remained on leasing momentum and investment allocation, with more pointed questions on distressed opportunities in life sciences.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management acknowledged challenges in the life sciences sector, including oversupply and tenant credit risks. Mitigation strategies include targeting core submarkets and structured investments with favorable risk-adjusted returns.</li> <li>Analysts expressed concerns about the potential impact of redevelopment activity on near-term earnings and the ability to capture sufficient leasing demand in competitive markets.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Healthpeak Properties concluded a strong 2024 with robust operational and financial performance, highlighted by merger synergies, strategic internalization efforts, and strong leasing momentum. The company is well-positioned for 2025, aiming to deploy $500 million in investments focused on life sciences and outpatient medical developments. Management's emphasis on balance sheet strength and targeted opportunities underscores a cautiously optimistic outlook amid evolving market conditions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOC/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p> </body></html>",
