(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TMOAF\" title=\"TomTom N.V.\">OTCPK:TMOAF</a>) Q4 2024</p> <h3>Management View</h3> <ul> <li>CEO Harold Goddijn highlighted that TomTom experienced mixed results in 2024. While the enterprise business gained traction, the automotive division faced challenging market conditions, leading to a decrease in the automotive backlog to €2.1<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> billion. The slower adoption of electric vehicles also contributed to reduced near-term expectations. However, the company strengthened its competitive position through investments in mapping platforms and applications.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Goddijn emphasized advancements in TomTom’s mapping technology, including a true 3D map designed for automated driving, which received positive feedback at CES 2025. He expressed confidence in the company’s ability to secure new contracts and facilitate top-line growth.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CFO Taco Titulaer reported Q4 group revenue of €142 million, a slight 1% year-on-year decline. Automotive IFRS revenue fell 10% to €79 million, while operational revenue increased 6%. Enterprise revenue grew to €43 million, and consumer revenue rose 10% to €20 million. Gross margin for the quarter was 87%, down slightly due to a higher consumer revenue mix.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>The company projected 2025 Location Technology revenue to range between €440 million and €490 million, with group revenue expected between €505 million and €565 million.

Consumer revenue dropped 10% year-on-year to €85 million.</li> <li>Operating expenses decreased by €8 million to €508 million, primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization. Free cash flow showed a €4 million outflow, influenced by lower automotive operational revenue and higher year-end receivables.</li> <li>Automotive operational revenue in Q4 grew 6% year-on-year, reflecting market volatility. Enterprise revenue demonstrated strong growth, driven by higher product utilization and new customer traction.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q&amp;A</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Wim Gille, ABN AMRO ODDO BHF, inquired about the outlook for enterprise and automotive segments. CFO Taco Titulaer responded that enterprise growth is anticipated, but automotive remains uncertain due to fluctuating royalty reports and macroeconomic challenges.</li> <li>Gille questioned the company's strategic use of its cash pile for share buybacks amid short-term uncertainty. Titulaer acknowledged the suggestion but noted no immediate plans for a buyback.</li> <li>Tim Ehlers, Kepler Cheuvreux, asked whether gross margins would improve as consumer revenue declines. Titulaer projected a record gross margin for 2025, likely reaching 88%.</li> <li>Ehlers also queried about Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) adoption. Titulaer explained that ADAS features, particularly in electric and high-end vehicles, are gaining traction and driving deeper integration of TomTom’s technology.</li> <li>Marc Hesselink, ING, sought clarity on the next steps for TomTom’s OS platform.
