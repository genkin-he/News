firm&#39;s models using domestically made graphic processing units (GPU) could &quot;set on fire&quot; China&#39;s AI industry.</p><p>On Saturday, Huawei Technologies, which also has its own line of AI chips, said it was working with AI infrastructure start-up SiliconFlow to make DeepSeek&#39;s models available to customers on its Ascend cloud service.</p><p>Their performance was comparable to models run on global, high-end chips, it added.</p><p>The news that Huawei had integrated DeepSeek&#39;s models with its Ascend chips marked a &quot;watershed moment,&quot; Bernstein analysts said in a note on Sunday.</p><p>&quot;DeepSeek demonstrates that competitive large language models (LLM) can be deployed on China&#39;s &#39;good enough&#39; chips, easing reliance on cutting-edge U.S. hardware&quot;,&quot; they added, citing Ascend and planned chips from Cambricon and Hygon.</p><p>Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent&#39;s cloud arms have also said they have made DeepSeek&#39;s models accessible via their services.</p><p>Last month, DeepSeek launched a free AI assistant that it says uses less data at a fraction of the cost of existing services.</p><p>Within a few days, its app overtook U.S. rival ChatGPT in downloads from Apple&#39;s App Store, triggering a global selloff in tech shares.</p><p>Earlier the company earlier drew attention in global AI circles with a research paper in December that said the training of DeepSeek-V3 required less than $6 million worth of computing power from Nvidia&#39;s H800 chips, versus the billions of dollars spent by the likes of tech giants Meta and Microsoft.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story

Will rate cuts need to - and be able to - do the heavy lifting to boost growth? That&#39;s our focus this week.</p><p>Trump fires his first tariff salvo, hitting Asian currencies including the rupee. And is India having a rethink of its approach to cryptocurrencies?

Now it&#39;s the central bank&#39;s turn.</p><p>Saturday&#39;s budget announcement focused on urban middle-class consumers and their clamour for relief from the high cost of living. Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#39;s government offered tax cuts that it hopes will boost consumption, along with some narrower policy steps such as funds for the strategic petroleum reserve and a stronger push into nuclear energy.</p><p>But analysts were disappointed at the lack of economic reforms that could propel growth back towards aspirational rates above 8%.</p><p>The measures fall some way short of constituting major stimulus, Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging market economist at Capital Economics, said in a report.</p><p>The onus now shifts to the Reserve Bank of India. Economists polled by Reuters expect it to begin cutting interest rates for the first time in more than four years when it meets this week.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Some forms of monetary policy easing have already begun. The central bank is adding liquidity to the banking system and has eased enforcement actions against non-bank lenders, which had made the sector more risk-averse. This should help to push up bank loan growth, which has fallen for six consecutive months.</p><p>The authorities have also loosened their grip on the rupee, allowing a greater degree of depreciation which in turn acts as a stimulus to exports.</p><p>How deep can they cut?</p><p>It&#39;s over to rate policy now, although economists doubt whether rate cuts alone could take India back to 8% growth within the next couple years.</p><p>HSBC expects two rate cuts in February and April of 25 basis points each, bringing down India&#39;s benchmark policy rate to 6%, in a &quot;shallow&quot; easing cycle, Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC, said in a report. Market volatility and brewing global trade wars could pressure India&#39;s balance of payments and weaken its currency, she said, preventing steeper rate cuts.</p><p>JPMorgan, however, expects 100 basis points in rate cuts in 2025, beginning this week, said Sajjid Chinoy, the bank&#39;s head of Asia economic research, in a December report.</p><p>Economists saw little risk that the budget&#39;s stimulus steps would stir up inflation and narrow the scope for rate reductions.</p><p>The government aims to trim the budget gap, or fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP, to 4.4% for 2025/26 from 4.8% this year, which would not be inflationary, HSBC&#39;s Bhandari said.</p><p>With inflation falling, &quot;we expect the RBI to cut rates and infuse domestic liquidity, picking up the growth baton&quot;, she said.</p><p>JPMorgan&#39;s Chinoy added that, with food prices expected to soften early this year on the back of a strong harvest and with GDP growth expected at 6.4% in the current financial year, well below the RBI&#39;s original estimate of 7.2%, there is room for significant rate easing.</p><p>How low should interest rates fall in India? Will the RBI rate cuts be enough to boost growth? Write to me with your views at ira.dugal@thomsonreuters.com.</p><p>Quote of the week</p><p>&quot;More than one or two jurisdictions have changed their stance towards cryptocurrency in terms of the usage, their acceptance, where they see the importance of crypto assets.&quot;</p><p>India&#39;s Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth told Reuters in an interview that the government is reviewing its approach to cryptocurrencies amid changes in policy globally.</p><p>Such assets &quot;don&#39;t believe in borders&quot; and India&#39;s stance cannot be unilateral, Seth said.</p><p>The Indian authorities have yet to release a discussion paper on cryptocurrency regulation originally scheduled for last September.

and Elizabeth Pineau</p><p>PARIS (Reuters) - All eyes are on the French capital next week to see if U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration can find common ground with China and nearly 100 other nations on the safe development of artificial intelligence.</p><p>About a year after world powers reckoned with the dangers of AI in England’s Bletchley Park, a wider array of countries are gathering in Paris to discuss putting the technology to work.</p><p>France, eager to promote its national industry, is hosting the AI Action Summit alongside India on Feb. 10 and 11, with a focus on areas where Europe’s second-largest economy has an advantage: freely available or “open-source” systems, and clean energy to power data centers.</p><p>Mitigating labor disruption and promoting sovereignty in a global AI market are also on the agenda.</p><p>Top executives from Alphabet, Microsoft and dozens of other businesses are slated to attend. Government leaders are expected to dine on Monday with select CEOs. And talks will include one on Tuesday by Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, two people involved in the summit told Reuters.</p><p>It was less clear whether the U.S. will reach consensus with other nations on AI.</p><p>Since taking office on Jan. 20, President Trump has revoked former President Joe Biden’s 2023 executive order on the technology, set in motion a repeat withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and faced Congressional calls to consider new export controls on AI chips to counter rival China.</p><p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance will attend for the American delegation.</p><p>A non-binding communiqué of principles for the stewardship of AI, bearing U.S., Chinese and other signatures, has been under negotiation and would mark a big achievement if reached, said the people involved in the summit, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p><p>They declined to detail the communiqué or elaborate if there were any points of disagreement among the would-be signatories.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>An official for the French presidency said the summit will give voice to countries around the world, not only the U.S. and China.</p><p>&quot;We are showing that AI is here, that companies must adopt it, that it is a vector of competitiveness for France and for Europe,&quot; the Élysée official said.</p><p>NO NEW AI REGULATION</p><p>Safety commitments dominated the conversation in prior global AI summits in Bletchley Park and Seoul. In Paris, creating new regulation is not on the agenda.</p><p>Reeling from red tape and a reputation for risk aversion, Europe and particularly France are eager to discuss frameworks for AI policy but not rules that could slow down their national champions, which have lagged American companies. Countries like France are evaluating how to implement the EU AI Act in as flexible a way as possible so it does not discourage innovation, the people involved in the summit said.</p><p>Instead in focus is how to distribute AI’s benefits to developing nations, via cheaper models made by the likes of France’s startup Mistral and China’s DeepSeek. The Hangzhou-based company rocked global markets last month by showing it could vie with U.S. heavyweights on human-like reasoning technology, while charging much less.</p><p>France has seized on the development as evidence that the global race to more powerful AI remains wide open.</p><p>One of the summit’s likely outcomes is that philanthropies and businesses are expected to commit an initial $500 million in capital, going up to $2.5 billion over five years, to fund public-interest projects on AI around the world, the people said.</p><p>Another is addressing the energy crunch that industry thinks is inevitable from their power-hungry AI models. A major producer of clean energy in the form of nuclear power, France wants to reconcile the world’s climate and AI ambitions.</p><p>France&#39;s decarbonized energy and &quot;nuclear fleet, in the context of data center installations, is an asset,&quot; the Élysée official said. &quot;We will most likely have announcements in this regard at the summit.&quot;</p><p>(Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin and Elizabeth Pineau; Additional reporting by Nandita Bose and Anna Tong; Editing by David Gregorio)</p></div></article></div>",

submitted for the former democracy leader&#39;s home -- the third time the sale has flopped.</p><p>The two-storey Yangon house, with about 0.8 hectares (1.9 acres) of land, was put up for sale with a minimum price of $140 million following a decades-long dispute over the property between the Nobel laureate and her brother.</p><p>Suu Kyi, who spent years under house arrest at the mansion under a former junta, has been detained since the military seized power once again in February 2021.</p><p>Around a dozen journalists, watched over by security personnel in plain clothes, attended the kerbside sale outside the colonial-era house on leafy University Avenue, a few doors from the US embassy.</p><p>After calling for bids starting from 297 billion kyats -- around $140 million at the official exchange rate -- and getting no response, the auctioneer called off the sale, AFP reporters at the scene saw.</p><p>&quot;I announce the auction is not successful after calling for bids three times,&quot; the auctioneer said.</p><p>Similar auctions failed in March and August last year.</p><p>With Myanmar&#39;s economy shattered by the civil war triggered by the military coup, it is unclear who in the country would be in a position to spend $140 million on a single, increasingly dilapidated property.</p><p>Real estate agents say similar-sized properties in upmarket Yangon areas might fetch $1 million to $2 million.</p><p>The house holds a special place in Myanmar history -- Suu Kyi was confined within its crumbling walls for around 15 years after shooting to fame during huge demonstrations against the then-junta in 1988.</p><p>Cut off from her husband and children in England, Suu Kyi spent time playing the piano, reading detective novels and meditating as her status as a democracy leader grew.</p><p>Hundreds of people would regularly gather on the pavement outside to hear her talk about&nbsp;democracy and fighting military rule through non-violence.</p><div

(-)</figcaption></div></figure><p>US President Donald Trump said Tuesday he was not in a hurry to speak with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, despite expectations that they would hold talks after announcing tit-for-tat tariffs in a growing trade conflict.</p><p>Beijing said it was imposing levies on imports of US energy, vehicles and equipment in a return salvo minutes after Trump&#39;s threatened tariffs on Chinese goods came into effect Tuesday.</p><p>A day prior, Trump suspended duties on Mexico and Canada for a month after both countries vowed to step up measures to counter flows of the drug fentanyl and the crossing of undocumented migrants into the United States.</p><p>Trump had signaled earlier that the talks with Xi could take place early this week, but addressing reporters at the White House Tuesday afternoon, he said he was in &quot;no rush&quot; to talk to Xi.</p><p>US stock markets shrugged off weakness on Tuesday, but Chinese stocks saw volatility after markets opened Wednesday as the US Postal Service said it was suspending inbound package shipments from China and Hong Kong &quot;until further notice.&quot;</p><p>Letters and flats, it said, would not be impacted.</p><p>Trump had imposed fresh 10 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, on top of levies that were already in place against Washington&#39;s biggest economic competitor. Mexico and Canada had faced 25 percent tariffs.</p><p>Trump&#39;s tariff order also eliminated a duty-free exemption for low value packages, a move that could delay packages of Chinese-founded online retailers Shein and Temu from entering the country.</p><p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that Trump was due to talk to Xi, but on Tuesday said she had no &quot;updates on when that call will take place.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He is not going to allow China to continue to source and distribute deadly fentanyl into our country, that was the reason for this tariff,&quot; Leavitt told reporters outside the West Wing of the White House.</p><p>- &#39;Malicious&#39; -</p><p>China unveiled 15 percent levies on imports of coal and liquefied natural gas from the United States, while crude oil, agricultural machinery, big-engined vehicles, and pickup trucks face 10 percent duties.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Beijing says it will also probe US tech giant Google and the US fashion group that owns Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein.</p><p>China&#39;s government said the measures were in response to the &quot;unilateral tariff hike&quot; by Washington. It said it would also file a complaint to the World Trade Organization over the &quot;malicious&quot; levies.</p><p>Additionally, it unveiled fresh export controls on rare metals and chemicals including tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, and molybdenum, used in a range of industrial appliances.</p><p>China is a major market for US energy exports and according to Beijing customs data, imports of oil, coal and LNG totaled more than $7 billion last year.</p><p>But that is dwarfed by China&#39;s imports from more friendly powers such as Russia, from which it purchased $94 billion-worth last year.</p><p>- Last-minute deals -</p><p>Trump has made tariffs a key foreign policy tool of his second term, joking that the word tariff is the &quot;most beautiful&quot; in the dictionary.</p><p>The Republican billionaire said his duties aimed to punish countries for failing to halt flows of illegal migrants and drugs including the powerful opioid fentanyl into the United States.</p><p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau both struck last-minute deals with Trump on Monday to tighten border measures, leading to a 30-day pause on threatened levies.</p><p>Talks will continue for the next month on broader pacts.</p><p>Mexico said Tuesday it had begun the 10,000-strong border troop deployment it had promised Trump as part of the agreement to halt tariffs.</p><p>&quot;The deployment has already started,&quot; Sheinbaum told reporters.</p><p>More than 450,000 people have been murdered countrywide since Mexico launched a major offensive against drug cartels in 2006.</p><p>Trudeau said Canada would appoint a &quot;Fentanyl Czar&quot; and list drug cartels as terrorist organizations.</p><p>burs-dk-bys/jgc</p></div></article></div>",
