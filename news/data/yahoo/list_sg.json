deliberately trying to score political points.</p><p>But Rubio, on a Latin America tour, also said he was issuing waivers which would allow for &quot;immediate&quot; and &quot;life-saving&quot; aid to continue after President Donald Trump ordered a 90-day suspension on taking office.</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know how much more clear we can be than that,&quot; he told reporters in Costa Rica.</p><p>&quot;I would say if some organization is receiving funds from the United States and does not know how to apply a waiver, then I have real questions about the competence of that organization, or I wonder whether they&#39;re deliberately sabotaging it for purposes of making a political point,&quot; said Rubio, a former Republican senator who long voted for foreign assistance.</p><p>A day earlier, Rubio said he had been made acting head of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) as Trump looks at integrating it under the State Department.</p><p>Non-governmental organizations say they have heard multiple cases of aid groups that have struggled to operate, mostly smaller, local organizations that did not have reserves.</p><p>Others fear long-term damage in areas that go far beyond food supplies, such as education and long-term relief work.</p><p>Some schools have shuttered in Uganda, where USAID was backing a universal education program, and demining work has been disrupted in Cambodia, among other cases.</p><p>In Geneva, Jens Laerke, a spokesman for United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA, said that the Trump administration was creating a &quot;state of confusion.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;Not charity&#39; -</p><p>Elon Musk, the billionaire tech entrepreneur who advises Trump, has vowed to kill USAID, saying it is run by &quot;radical lunatics.&quot;</p><p>USAID managed more than $40 billion in the 2023 fiscal year.

I continue to support foreign aid.&nbsp;But foreign aid is not charity,&quot; Rubio said.</p><p>Rubio announced that he was issuing new waivers to ensure the flow of assistance to Costa Rica, a major US partner on issues including migration and drug-trafficking.</p><p>US assistance includes biometric work to stop smugglers, which Rubio pointed out as an example of concrete American help that benefits its own interests.</p><p>&quot;Under President Trump, we have a foreign policy in which we are strong in providing support to our allies,&quot; Rubio said as he met Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves.</p><p>- Pushing on China -</p><p>The top US diplomat, on his third stop in his first trip, is a longtime China hawk who is also looking to push back on Beijing&#39;s influence in the region.</p><p>Costa Rica in 2007 switched recognition to China from Taiwan, the self-governing democracy claimed by Beijing -- a turning point as other Latin American countries followed suit.</p><p>But US officials also see hope in the example of Costa Rica, whose relations with China have turned rockier in recent years.</p><p>Chaves in 2023 effectively forbade Chinese tech titan Huawei from bidding for the nation&#39;s 5G network due to Beijing&#39;s refusal to sign an international agreement on cybercrime.</p><p>&quot;When you confront companies that are not secure, they&#39;re backed by governments like the government of China that likes to threaten, that likes to sabotage, that likes to use economic coercion to punish you,&quot; Rubio said.</p><p>Costa Rica has been &quot;very firm, and I think they deserve a lot of support in confronting that,&quot; Rubio said.</p><p>Rubio later flew to Guatemala, the most populous nation that still recognizes Taiwan.</p><p>sct/md</p></div></article></div>",

decision to remove public health data and other information from government websites that health care experts use every day.</p><p>The group on Tuesday <a

challenge the Office of Personnel Management for allegedly directing the removal, as well as health agencies that took the information down: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the overarching Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p>OPM issued a memo last month following Trump’s Day 1 executive order on “defending women.” The order calls on federal agencies to officially “recognize two sexes, male and female,” and to “use the term ‘sex’ and not ‘gender’” in official documents. OPM told agency heads that they had two days to end programs that “promote or inculcate gender ideology” and take down any “outward facing media (websites, social media accounts, etc.) that inculcate or promote gender ideology,” among other things.</p><p>Information removed included data on risk behaviors in children, materials guiding researchers on developing clinical trials, data on HIV infections and much more.</p><p>The lawsuit stated that the removal “creates a dangerous gap in the scientific data available to monitor and respond to disease outbreaks, deprives physicians of resources that guide clinical practice, and takes away key resources for communicating and engaging with patients.”</p><p>“The removal of this information deprives researchers of access to information that is necessary for treating patients, for developing clinical studies that produce results that accurately reflect the effects treatments will have in clinical practice, and for developing practices and policies that protect the health of vulnerable populations and the country as a whole,” the suit said.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Zach Shelley, a lawyer for Public Citizen Litigation Group who is leading the suit, said in a statement that federal public health agencies “exist to serve the American people by protecting public health.”</p><p>“Removing this vital information flouts that mandate,” he added.</p><p>Trump has signed dozens of executive orders in his first days in office, sparking a flurry of legal action in protest.</p><p>A separate suit filed in response to the gender-related order was brought by a transgender woman in federal prison to stop her from being transferred to a men’s facility and being denied gender-affirming care.
