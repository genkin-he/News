Donald Trump unleashes trade wars and tariffs, the system for settling such disputes within the World Trade Organization has been paralysed for years -- by the United States.</p><p>Having returned to the White House, Trump has imposed a 10 percent tariff hike on Chinese goods, with Beijing immediately retaliating with tariffs on US imports of energy, cars and machinery parts.</p><p>China said Tuesday that it would file a complaint with the WTO over the &quot;malicious&quot; US levies -- but that move is likely to hit a dead end, unless Beijing and Washington resolve the spat of their own accord.</p><p>- Obama, Trump, Biden roadblock -</p><p>The WTO was founded in 1995 as a successor to GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade dating back to 1948.</p><p>The process for resolving a dispute at the Geneva-based global trade body goes through several stages.</p><p>When a complaint is brought, consultations are initiated between the members at odds with each other.</p><p>If no agreement is reached, the complainant can request the establishment of a special panel, made up of three to five experts. Countries can appeal against the panel&#39;s ruling.</p><p>But the WTO&#39;s Appellate Body, composed of seven specialists in international law and trade, has not been able to handle any new cases since December 2019: its seats remain empty due to the United States blocking nominations.</p><p>This practice began under US president Barack Obama, continued throughout Trump&#39;s first term, and carried on under his successor Joe Biden.</p><p>Washington accuses the Appellate Body of over-interpreting international trade rules and not respecting WTO deadlines for completing cases.</p><p>The United States also insists the body&#39;s decisions must not encroach on &quot;national security&quot;.</p><p>In 2022, the WTO&#39;s members decided to hold discussions aimed at having a fully operational system up and running by 2024 -- but no agreement has yet been reached.</p><p>In the meantime, a number of WTO members, including the European Union and China, have developed an alternative appellate process allowing some cases move forward.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Among those cases is a spat between Brussels and Colombia over Bogota&#39;s anti-dumping duties on imports of frozen fries from three EU nations.</p><p>But the United States has not signed up.</p><p>So while this temporary system works well for the participating countries, it does not prevent other WTO members from continuing to file appeals to the moribund Appellate Body -- effectively leaving the cases in limbo.</p><p>- Into the void -</p><p>Currently, 32 dispute panel rulings &quot;have been appealed into the void&quot;, according to the WTO.</p><p>As a result, the decisions of the agency&#39;s Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) do not apply because the appeal is up in the air.</p><p>Of these 32 appeals, two were filed by the United States -- against China and Turkey -- and 11 were filed against the United States, including three by China, two by Canada and two by Turkey.</p><p>And although the Appellate Body is not functioning, a number of countries are continuing to launch initial complaints, as China has now done.</p><p>The last time Washington brought a dispute in the first instance was in July 2019, in an agricultural spat with India. The two countries have since reached an agreement.</p><p>When a country is rebuked by the dispute settlement body, it must implement the experts&#39; recommendations within a so-called reasonable timeframe set by the DSB. Sanctions can be imposed if the country does not fulfil its obligations.</p><p>apo/rjm/nl/js</p></div></article></div>",

(-)</figcaption></div></figure><p>US President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are expected to speak by phone on Tuesday, just hours after slapping tariffs on each other&#39;s economies in an escalating trade war.</p><p>Beijing said it was imposing levies on imports of US energy, vehicles and equipment in a return salvo minutes after Trump&#39;s threatened tariffs on Chinese goods came into effect.</p><p>Trump suspended tariffs on Mexico and Canada on Monday for a month after they vowed to step up measures to counter flows of the drug fentanyl and crossing of undocumented migrants into the United States.</p><p>Stock markets wavered on Tuesday as investors braced for volatile market activity in the coming weeks over Trump&#39;s threatened tariffs on the three biggest US trading partners.</p><p>&quot;Let&#39;s see what happens with the call today,&quot; Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro, a veteran of the US president&#39;s first term, told news outlet Politico.</p><p>Asked if Trump could halt the tariffs on China too, he added: &quot;It&#39;s up to the boss. I never get ahead of the boss, that&#39;s why I&#39;m sitting here.&quot;</p><p>Trump imposed fresh 10 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, on top of levies that were already in place against America&#39;s biggest economic competitor. Mexico and Canada had faced 25 percent tariffs.</p><p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that Trump was due to talk to Xi, but said Tuesday that &quot;I don&#39;t have any updates on when that call will take place.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He is not going to allow China to continue to source and distribute deadly fentanyl into our country, that was the reason for this tariff,&quot; Leavitt told reporters outside the West Wing.</p><p>- &#39;Malicious&#39; -</p><p>China unveiled levies of 15 percent on imports of coal and liquefied natural gas from the United States, while crude oil, agricultural machinery, big-engined vehicles, and pickup trucks face 10 percent duties.</p><p>It says it will also probe US tech giant Google and the American fashion group which owns Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Beijing said the measures were in response to the &quot;unilateral tariff hike&quot; by Washington. It said it would also file a complaint to the World Trade Organization over the &quot;malicious&quot; levies.</p><p>It also unveiled fresh export controls on rare metals and chemicals including tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, and molybdenum, used in a range of industrial appliances.</p><p>China is a major market for US energy exports and according to Beijing customs data, imports of oil, coal and LNG totaled more than $7 billion last year.</p><p>But that is dwarfed by China&#39;s imports from more friendly powers such as Russia, from which it purchased $94 billion-worth last year.</p><p>- Last-minute deals -</p><p>Trump has made tariffs a key foreign policy tool of his second term, joking that the word tariff is the &quot;most beautiful&quot; in the dictionary.</p><p>The Republican billionaire said his tariffs aimed to punish countries for failing to halt flows of illegal migrants and drugs including the powerful opioid fentanyl into the United States.</p><p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had both struck last-minute deals with Trump on Monday to tighten border measures, leading to a 30-day pause on threatened tariffs.</p><p>Talks will continue for the next month on broader deals.</p><p>Mexico said it had begun the 10,000-strong border troop deployment it had promised Trump as part of the agreement to halt tariffs.</p><p>&quot;The deployment has already started,&quot; Sheinbaum told reporters.</p><p>More than 450,000 people have been murdered countrywide since Mexico launched a major offensive against drug cartels in 2006.</p><p>Trudeau meanwhile said Canada would appoint a &quot;Fentanyl Czar&quot; and list drug cartels as terrorist organizations.</p><p>burs-dk/bjt</p></div></article></div>",

the complexity and cost of complying with the world&#39;s first legislation on the use of the technology.</p><p>The Artificial Intelligence Act, binding since last year, will be fully applicable on Aug. 2, 2026, with certain provisions kicking in earlier, such as the ban on certain practices from Feb. 2 this year.</p><p>&quot;The ambition is to provide legal certainty for those who provide or deploy the artificial intelligence systems on the European market, also for the market surveillance authorities. The guidelines are not legally binding,&quot; a Commission official told reporters.</p><p>Prohibited practices include AI-enabled dark patterns embedded in services designed to manipulate users into making substantial financial commitments, and AI-enabled applications which exploit users based on their age, disability or socio-economic situation.</p><p>AI-enabled social scoring using unrelated personal data such as origin and race by social welfare agencies and other public and private bodies is banned, while police are not allowed to predict individuals&#39; criminal behaviour solely based on their biometric data if this has not been verified.</p><p>Employers cannot use webcams and voice recognition systems to track employees&#39; emotions, while mobile CCTV cameras equipped with AI-based facial recognition technologies for law enforcement purposes are prohibited, with limited exceptions and stringent safeguards.</p><p>EU countries have until Aug. 2 to designate market surveillance authorities to enforce the AI rules. AI breaches can cost companies fines ranging from 1.5% to 7% of their total global revenue.</p><p>The EU AI Act is more comprehensive than the United States&#39; light-touch voluntary compliance approach while China&#39;s approach aims to maintain social stability and state control.</p><p>(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Alison Williams)</p></div></article></div>",

his return to the White House (Jim WATSON)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was set to meet Donald Trump on Tuesday, the first foreign leader hosted by the new US president, with the pair poised to address the fragile Gaza truce.</p><p>After Trump claimed credit for securing the Israel-Hamas truce after more than 15 months of fighting and bombing, he was likely to urge his ally to stick to the deal -- parts of which have yet to be finalised.</p><p>In a possible sign of progress, Israel said hours ahead of the White House meeting that it was sending a team to mediator Qatar to discuss the second phase of the agreement, which could lead to a more permanent end to the war.</p><p>Palestinian group Hamas said on Tuesday that negotiations for the second phase had begun, with spokesman Abdel Latif al-Qanou saying the focus was on &quot;shelter, relief and reconstruction&quot; for the war-ravaged Gaza Strip.</p><p>Trump has touted a plan to &quot;clean out&quot; Gaza, calling for Palestinians to move to Egypt or Jordan.</p><p>Both countries have flatly rejected his proposal, as have the territory&#39;s own residents.</p><p>&quot;Trump thinks Gaza is a pile of garbage -- absolutely not,&quot; said Hatem Azzam, a 34-year-old resident of the Gaza Strip.</p><p>&quot;Trump and Netanyahu must understand the reality of the Palestinian people and the people of Gaza. This is a people deeply rooted in their land. We will not leave,&quot; he added.</p><p>In line with the ceasefire, Palestinian militant groups and Israel have begun exchanging hostages held in Gaza for prisoners in Israeli custody.</p><p>- &#39;Redrawn the map&#39; -</p><p>The war began when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, taking into Gaza 251 hostages, dozens of whom have since been confirmed dead.</p><p>Seventy-six are still held in the Palestinian territory including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.</p><p>Families of the Israeli hostages have been urging all sides to ensure the agreement is maintained so their loved ones can be freed.</p><p>Relatives of the youngest hostages, Ariel and Kfir Bibas, made a plea on Monday for information on the two boys and their mother, Shiri, after their father Yarden Bibas was released in the latest swap.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;Shiri, Ariel and Kfir, we miss you so much and are waiting for you,&quot; said Ofri Bibas, Yarden&#39;s sister.</p><p>Before leaving for Washington, Netanyahu said Israel&#39;s wars with Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and its confrontations with Iran since October 2023 had &quot;redrawn the map&quot; of the Middle East.</p><p>&quot;I believe that working closely with President Trump we can redraw it even further, and for the better,&quot; he said.</p><p>Trump, who prides himself on his dealmaking abilities, may seek to offer Netanyahu incentives to sticking to the truce, such as a normalisation deal with Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Efforts under Trump&#39;s predecessor Joe Biden for normalisation froze with the Gaza war, and Saudi Arabia has in recent months hardened its position insisting there would be no agreement without a Palestinian state.</p><p>Trump said Sunday that talks with Israel and other Middle Eastern countries were &quot;progressing&quot; -- before warning that he had &quot;no assurances&quot; and &quot;no guarantees&quot; that the truce in Gaza would hold.</p><p>The US president&#39;s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who met Netanyahu on Monday over terms for the second phase of the truce, said that he was &quot;certainly hopeful&quot;.</p><p>- West Bank violence -</p><p>Since the truce took effect on January 19, Israel has turned its focus to the occupied West Bank, launching a deadly operation in the area around Jenin, a hotbed of Palestinian militancy.</p><p>UN aid agency UNRWA, which is now banned in Israel, warned the refugee camp of Jenin was &quot;going into a catastrophic direction&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Large parts of the camp were completely destroyed in a series of detonations by the Israeli forces. It is estimated that 100 houses were destroyed or heavily damaged,&quot; said UNRWA spokeswoman Juliette Touma.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Israeli army said a gunman killed two Israeli soldiers in an attack on a military post in Tayasir, south of the Jenin area in the northern West Bank. The assailant was also killed.</p><p>Asked about how he viewed a possible annexation of the West Bank, Trump did not rule it out, telling reporters that Israel was &quot;a small country in terms of land&quot;.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s a pretty small piece of land. And it&#39;s amazing that they&#39;ve been able to do what they&#39;ve been able to do,&quot; he said.</p><p>Under the Gaza ceasefire&#39;s ongoing 42-day first phase, Hamas was to free 33 hostages in staggered releases in exchange for around 1,900 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.</p><p>Four hostage-prisoner exchanges have already taken place, with militants freeing 18 hostages in exchange of some 600 mostly Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.</p><p>The truce has also led to a surge of food, fuel, medical and other aid into Gaza, and allowed people displaced by the war to return to the north of the Palestinian territory.</p><p>Hamas&#39;s attack resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people on Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p><p>Israel&#39;s retaliatory response has killed at least 47,518 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory&#39;s health ministry. The UN considers these figures as reliable.</p><p>burs-ser/ami</p></div></article></div>",

among countries in Africa&#39;s Lake Chad region are hindering efforts to end a more than decade-long jihadist insurgency, according to local officials and security sources.</p><p>The region, comprising the four countries that surround Lake Chad -- Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria -- has been battling insurgency since 2009, after a spate of violent campaigns by the Boko Haram jihadist group in Nigeria&#39;s northeast spilled into its neighbours.</p><p>The ensuing conflict, which has drawn in other jihadist groups such as the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), has killed over 40,000 people and displaced around two million, causing one of the world&#39;s worst humanitarian crises.</p><p>Last week, Nigeria&#39;s Yobe State, one of the most impacted by jihadist violence, held a summit to discuss how to stabilise and recover areas affected by the conflict, in collaboration with organisations including the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).</p><p>The lake region has become a jihadist stronghold, disrupting fishing, farming and herding, on which the 40 million people who live there depend.</p><p>Jihadist violence has added to the cocktail of challenges the region has faced for the last 40 years.</p><p>The lake&#39;s surface water has shrunk by 90 percent due largely to climate change and mismanagement, making the region&#39;s population among the world&#39;s poorest.</p><p>Since 2013, a regional military coalition involving troops from the four countries, the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF), has been fighting Islamist groups in the area.</p><p>But recent diplomatic faceoffs, especially between Nigeria and Niger, are hampering progress, military chiefs said.</p><p>Relations between the two neighbours soured after the military took power in Niger in 2023.</p><p>The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), currently headed by Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, responded with crippling sanctions, and Niger broke away from the group.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>- Recriminations -</p><p>Chad, Niger and Nigeria hurled allegations of lethargy, sabotage and non-cooperation during the summit, warning that the situation was hindering the anti-jihadist fight.</p><p>In a veiled message to Niger, Nigeria&#39;s Tinubu warned that regional discord would only benefit Boko Haram and ISWAP, which he described as the &quot;true enemy&quot;.</p><p>He told the summit the jihadists do not stand &quot;a chance against the collective strength&quot; of the regional military coalition, warning against &quot;misinformation and falsehoods which breed mistrust&quot;.</p><p>But the governor of Niger&#39;s Diffa region, Brigadier General Mahamadou Ibrahim Bagadoma, said there could only be cooperation and coordination when Nigerian interference and sabotage against his country stopped.</p><p>He reiterated recent claims that French troops recently expelled from his country were using Nigeria as a base to attack Niger. Nigeria has repeatedly denied the accusation.</p><p>&quot;The problem is while some are making efforts, some are sabotaging them,&quot; Bagadoma said at the summit.</p><p>He told reporters that &quot;the existing sour relations (with Nigeria) is a political issue&quot; that would be difficult to solve as long as &quot;some people take the path of selfishness&quot;.</p><p>The governor of Chad&#39;s Lake Province, General Saleh Tidjani Haggar, deplored the lack of military and intelligence sharing between the four countries.</p><p>The region could &quot;finish off Boko Haram in three months&quot; if it worked together, he said.</p><p>A Nigerian intelligence report seen by AFP and shared among Nigerian security circles on Monday showed how ISWAP had chased out communities in the Damasak area along Nigeria&#39;s border with Niger in preparation for a possible attack on military bases in the region, highlighting the lack of coordination between the two countries.</p><p>- &#39;One Family&#39; -</p><p>An AFP journalist saw the MNJTF commander, Nigerian Major General Godwin Mutkut, complaining to Bagadoma on the sidelines of the summit about an alleged order for Niger&#39;s military officers not to talk to their counterparts from Nigeria.</p><p>Speaking at the summit, General Christopher Musa, Nigeria&#39;s defence chief, called on Niger to come back into the fold of the MNJTF.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m very happy... that the governor of Diffa is here. I want to assure him that we are one family. There is no dispute between us that cannot be solved,&quot; Musa said.</p><p>Mamman Nuhu, the head of the Lake Chad Basin Development Commission (LCBDC), acknowledged the negative impact the lack of military coordination between Nigeria and Niger is having on the region despite the &quot;huge progress&quot; made.</p><p>&quot;Defeating Boko Haram is key to restoring peace and prosperity to the region,&quot; Nuhu told AFP.</p><p>abu/tba/jhb</p></div></article></div>",

ISMOYO)</figcaption></div></figure><p>A Frenchman on death row in Indonesia since 2007 for drug offences left for France on Tuesday, with his lawyer saying he was &quot;happy and calm&quot; ahead of returning home.</p><p>Serge Atlaoui, 61, left for Paris on board a KLM flight via Amsterdam, senior Indonesian law and human rights official I Nyoman Gede Surya Mataram told AFP on Tuesday evening.</p><p>Atlaoui&#39;s lawyer Richard Sedillot said he would work to have his client&#39;s sentence &quot;adapted&quot; so that the father of four could be released.</p><p>&quot;I am delighted that the fight we have led has resulted in the victory of life over death,&quot; Sedillot told AFP.</p><p>Indonesia, which has some of the world&#39;s toughest drug laws, has released half a dozen high-profile detainees in recent weeks.</p><p>They include a Filipina mother on death row and the last five members of the &quot;Bali Nine&quot; drug ring.</p><p>Atlaoui was tight-lipped and wore a face mask at an earlier news conference after he was driven in a black van from Jakarta&#39;s Salemba prison to the city&#39;s main airport and handed over to French police officers.</p><p>French ambassador Fabien Penone thanked Indonesian authorities for allowing the transfer.</p><p>- &#39;Glimmer of hope&#39; -</p><p>Sedillot earlier described Atlaoui as &quot;happy and calm&quot; but said he would &quot;need a little bit of time to reorganise himself&quot;.</p><p>Jakarta has left it to the French government to grant Atlaoui -- the only Frenchman on death row in Indonesia -- either clemency, amnesty or a reduced sentence.</p><p>His return was made possible after an agreement between French Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin and his Indonesian counterpart, Yusril Ihza Mahendra, on January 24.</p><p>In the agreement, Jakarta said they had decided not to execute Atlaoui and authorised his return on &quot;humanitarian grounds&quot; because he was ill.</p><p>Atlaoui had been receiving weekly medical treatment at a hospital.</p><p>&quot;After all these years of incarceration, this is the moment I was waiting for,&quot; his wife Sabine told RTL radio.</p><div

continues</button></div><p>Raphael Chenuil-Hazan, executive director of ECPM, a French anti-death penalty NGO, said Atlaoui&#39;s return to France was &quot;a great relief&quot;.</p><p>&quot;This release is a glimmer of hope,&quot; he said.</p><p>- Death penalty appeal -</p><p>Atlaoui was arrested in 2005 at a factory in a Jakarta suburb where dozens of kilogrammes of drugs were discovered. He was accused by authorities of being a &quot;chemist&quot;.</p><p>A welder from Metz in northeastern France, he has always denied being a drug trafficker, saying that he was installing machinery in what he thought was&nbsp;an acrylic factory.</p><p>&quot;I thought there was something suspicious (about the factory),&quot; Atlaoui told AFP in 2015.</p><p>Initially sentenced to life in prison, his sentence was reviewed by the supreme court and changed to death on appeal.</p><p>He was due to be executed alongside eight others in 2015 but was granted a reprieve after Paris applied pressure and the Indonesian authorities allowed an outstanding appeal to proceed.</p><p>There are currently at least 530 inmates on death row in Indonesia, according to official figures used by human rights organisation Kontas.</p><p>Among them are 90 foreigners, including at least one woman, according to the ministry of immigration and correction.</p><p>The Indonesian government recently signalled it will resume executions, which have not been carried out since 2016.</p><p>Filipina inmate Mary Jane Veloso, who was arrested in 2010 and sentenced to death for drug trafficking, was returned to her home country in December after an agreement was reached between both countries.</p><p>ebe/tc/fox/pbt/gil</p></div></article></div>",
