vaccines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">questioned the safety of vaccines</a>. </span></p><p>But after pressure from Trump and his army of online allies, nearly every Republican has backed down and embraced all of the president’s picks for powerful Cabinet posts, including Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p><p>Trump is now set to continue efforts to dismantle parts of the federal government with a full complement of top aides, working in tandem with billionaire Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Musk’s team has moved to unilaterally gut federal agencies and freeze spending approved by Congress, over the objections of Democrats and legal experts, who warn it could be unconstitutional.</p><p>“The senate of America seems a lot like the Senate of late Rome. They exist to do the bidding of the emperor,” former Illinois GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a prominent Trump critic, wrote in a <a href=\"https://x.com/AdamKinzinger/status/1886812539637416338\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">post</a> online on Tuesday.</p><h2><strong>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</strong></h2><p>Kennedy has drawn strong opposition from Democrats and outside groups over his long history of peddling anti-vaccine misinformation, including the falsehood that vaccines cause autism. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who is a physician and the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, initially appeared to have grave doubts about Kennedy’s belief in settled science.</p><p>“I’ve been struggling with your nomination,” Cassidy admitted to Kennedy last month, when he testified before the health panel.</p><p>“As someone who has discussed immunizations with thousands of people, I understand that mothers want reassurance that the vaccine their child is receiving is necessary, safe and effective,” said the Louisiana senator. “I’ve approached it using the preponderance of evidence to reassure, and you’ve approached it using selective evidence to cast doubt.”</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Fast forward to Tuesday, and moments before the Senate Finance Committee voted to advance Kennedy to the Senate floor for his confirmation vote, Cassidy — also a member of this committee — <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rfk-senate-committee-hhs_n_67a22b5ae4b0cf0f0a35f28a?ndk\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:voted to back his nomination;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">voted to back his nomination</a>. He explained that he changed his mind because Kennedy promised to “meet or speak multiple times a month” about what he’s working on and receive input on his hiring decisions at the department.</p><p>“Mr. Kennedy and the administration reached out, seeking to reassure me regarding their commitment to protecting the public health benefit of vaccination,” Cassidy said. “To this end, Mr. Kennedy and the administration committed that he and I would have an unprecedentedly close, collaborative working relationship if he is confirmed. ... This collaboration will allow us to work well together and therefore to be more effective.”</p><p>Kennedy said that the partnership “will allow us to represent all sides” of vaccine safety in government.</p><p>Cassidy’s decision to support Kennedy was worrisome even to some conservative observers, as they feared he had dropped his legitimate concerns about the nominee in order to get in line with his party behind Trump. The Louisiana Republican is up for reelection in 2026 and has already drawn a GOP primary challenger, who is likely to remind voters about Cassidy’s vote to convict Trump in his 2021 Senate impeachment trial following the Jan. 6 insurrection.</p><p>“Cassidy’s vote is the single most disappointing, and frightening, occurrence yet in the series of abject surrenders to Trump,” Quin Hillyer, a longtime conservative columnist based in Alabama, <a href=\"https://x.com/quinhillyer/status/1886824479738724394?s=46&amp;t=baBBhbs8HKxS8e5N8kXp1g\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:wrote on social media;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">wrote on social media</a>. “It says there remains NO check in Congress, NONE, against Trump’s outrages, constitutional abuses, and seizures of unwarranted power.”</p><h2><strong>Tulsi Gabbard</strong></h2><p>Gabbard, a lieutenant colonel in the National Guard and former Democratic member of Congress who switched parties last year, had been viewed as the Trump nominee with one of the hardest paths to confirmation. Numerous Senate Republicans expressed concerns with her qualifications to be director of national intelligence, her commitment to top secret intelligence programs, her 2017 meeting with former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and her past statements echoing Moscow’s talking points about Russia’s war on Ukraine.</p><p>Frustration with Gabbard <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tulsi-gabbard-donald-trump-snowden_n_679bd0bae4b0e1faebeee9c7\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:boiled over;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">boiled over </a>during her committee hearing last week, with multiple GOP senators urging her to condemn Edward Snowden, who leaked information on classified intelligence programs in 2013. In Congress, Gabbard had called Snowden “brave” and proposed calling for charges to be dropped against him. She refused to disavow her past support for Snowden and call him a “traitor,” as several Republican senators demanded.</p><p>“It would befit you and be helpful to the way you are perceived to the members of the Intelligence Committee if you at least acknowledge that the greatest whistleblower in American security, so-called, harmed national security,” Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) told Gabbard.</p><p>On Monday, however, Gabbard’s nomination got a major boost after Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a GOP swing vote, announced she would support her confirmation. The Republican senator said Gabbard had addressed her concerns about Snowden and promised not to endorse a potential presidential pardon for him.</p><p>With Collins squarely in the yes column, all eyes turned to Young, a Marine and former intelligence officer with hawkish views who had been critical of Trump in the past. The Indiana Republican announced his support for Gabbard on Tuesday shortly before her nomination advanced in the Senate Intelligence Committee after speaking with Trump and billionaire Elon Musk. The Tesla CEO and Trump ally accused Young of being a “<a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-called-todd-young-223044360.html\" data-ylk=\"slk:deep state puppet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link\">deep state puppet</a>” over the weekend, but Musk <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-called-todd-young-223044360.html\" data-ylk=\"slk:recanted;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link\">recanted</a> shortly after Young got on the phone with him.</p><p>Young said he was satisfied with commitments Gabbard had made to him to hold any leakers of intelligence information accountable and to not recommend any pardon for Snowden.</p><p>“I have done what the Framers envisioned for senators to do: use the consultative process to seek firm commitments, in this case commitments that will advance our national security, which is my top priority as a former Marine Corps intelligence officer,” Young said Tuesday.</p><p>Unlike Cassidy, Young does not face reelection until 2028, theoretically giving him a degree of political insulation in the Senate. Still, the prospect of singlehandedly taking down a Trump nominee would have risked even greater anger from Trump’s allies, even though the president reportedly told Young to “<a href=\"https://x.com/mkraju/status/1886864354064130327\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:vote your conscience;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">vote your conscience</a>.”</p><h2><strong>Pete Hegseth</strong></h2><p>Last month, the Senate confirmed Hegseth as Trump’s defense secretary after weeks of debate about his slim qualifications and his alleged history of excessive drinking and domestic abuse. Three GOP senators — Collins, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky — stood in opposition, but Vice President JD Vance broke the 50-50 tie and his nomination was confirmed.</p><p>New reporting from <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/pete-hegseth-thom-tillis-senate-confirmation-1974dd47?st=eeDK69&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:The Wall Street Journal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">The Wall Street Journal</a> on Monday, however, revealed that another GOP senator — Thom Tillis of North Carolina — had been prepared to vote against Hegseth because of the abuse allegations, and had informed the White House of his intention to do so. Tillis backed down <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/pete-hegseth-thom-tillis-senate-confirmation-1974dd47?st=eeDK69&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:hours before the vote;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">hours before the vote</a>, however, after GOP leaders told him they would not cancel it, making clear he’d have to endure backlash from Trump’s MAGA allies if he voted Hegseth down.</p><p>“Anytime you have an allegation and somebody is willing to put it in sworn testimony, you owe it to the process to review it and not just dispose it out of hand,” Tills told<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senator-tillis-opens-up-about-role-pete-hegseths-confirmation-after-ex-sister-in-law-allegations\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Fox News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"> Fox News</a> about conversations with Hegseth’s accusers. “And that’s exactly what I did. And then I arrived at the conclusion that I’d support Pete’s nomination.”</p><p>Tillis is also up for reelection in 2026 and is likely to face several GOP primary challengers. In 2023, the North Carolina state Republican Party <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/06/11/1181549031/thom-tillis-north-carolina-censure-lgbtq-rights-gun-control-immigration\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:censured;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">censured</a> Tillis for backing LGBTQ+ rights, immigration and gun violence policies in Congress.</p><p>Some Democrats said they were surprised to see their Republican colleagues fold so quickly on Trump’s most problematic Cabinet picks.</p><p>“There are so many reasons that they should be defeated by their own statements, both past and recent,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said of the nominees.</p><p>Of his colleagues, Blumenthal added, “Anyone voting for these nominees will be haunted by those decisions when they do bad things.”</p><p>Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) also expressed disappointment in Republican senators, who he said are “maybe secretly whispering” to Democrats about their concerns with certain Trump nominees but will then turn around and vote for them on the Senate floor.</p><p>“At some point, people are going to have to stand up and say, this is not what we meant,” Schatz said in a speech on the Senate floor.</p><h3>Related...</h3><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/times-tulsi-gabbard-congress-now-deposed-syria-bashar-assad_n_675c8ab8e4b08821cba7819a\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:7 Times Tulsi Gabbard Went To Bat In Congress For Now-Deposed Syrian Dictator Bashar Assad;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">7 Times Tulsi Gabbard Went To Bat In Congress For Now-Deposed Syrian Dictator Bashar Assad</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-vaccines-kennedy-autism-conspiracy_n_67a227ffe4b09c9485622a52\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Trump Appears To Support Vaccine Conspiracy Theory In Pro-RFK Jr. Post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Trump Appears To Support Vaccine Conspiracy Theory In Pro-RFK Jr. Post</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rfk-jr-abortion-medication-fda_n_67a1373ae4b06678d2a183ba\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Why RFK Jr.&#39;s Promise On Medication Abortion Matters More Than You Think;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Why RFK Jr.&#39;s Promise On Medication Abortion Matters More Than You Think</a></p></li></ul></div></article></div>",

Kenya-led force.</p><p>The UN Security Council gave the green light in October 2023 to the Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission designed to support Haiti&#39;s authorities in their fight against criminal gangs, which control swaths of the country.</p><p>Washington&#39;s funding freeze comes as part of newly elected President Donald Trump&#39;s push to slash US overseas aid, a drive that has included an effort to shutter the operations of the government&#39;s main aid agency, USAID.</p><p>In late January, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that Haiti&#39;s capital could become overrun by gangs if the international community does not step up aid to the security mission.</p><p>More money, equipment and personnel are needed for the international force, Guterres said, adding that any further delays risk the &quot;catastrophic&quot; collapse of Haiti&#39;s security institutions and &quot;could allow gangs to overrun the entire metropolitan area&quot; of the capital Port-au-Prince.</p><p>Haiti&#39;s Foreign Minister Jean-Victor Harvel Jean-Baptiste, speaking at a meeting of the UN Security Council, has said that the country faced &quot;major difficulties&quot; that threaten not just the population but also &quot;the very survival of the state.&quot;</p><p>The MSS is not a UN force, but the UN has set up a voluntary fund to finance it, which has raised $110 million to date, an amount that has been deemed largely insufficient.</p><p>Just under 800 of the 2,500 security personnel hoped for have been deployed.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore

transferred $15 million to the fund -- the second-largest contribution, after Canada&#39;s $63 million -- with $1.7 million already disbursed.</p><p>In parallel with the UN-hosted fund, the United States, then headed by Joe Biden, had contributed over $300 million in funds and equipment directly to the MSS, including dozens of armored vehicles.</p><p>Haiti currently has no president or parliament and is ruled by a transitional body, which is struggling to manage extreme violence linked to criminal gangs, poverty and other challenges.</p><p>More than 5,626 people were killed in Haiti last year as a result of gang violence, about a thousand more than in 2023, the UN said.</p><p>More than a million Haitians have been forced to flee their homes, three times as many as a year

Most European nations have more leeway in revoking citizenship.</p><p>Bukele has carried a sweeping crackdown on crime that includes rounding up people without warrants.</p><p>He last year opened the &quot;Terrorism Confinement Center,&quot; or CECOT, where he has now offered to jail Americans.</p><p>Designed to house 40,000 inmates, the vast prison lies behind huge concrete walls on the edge of a jungle, with inmates allowed out of their cells only for 30 minutes a day of exercise and for virtual court appointments.</p><p>Bukele has faced criticism from human rights groups but enjoys sky-high approval ratings from a public grateful for the sharp reduction of crime in what was once one of the world&#39;s most violent countries.</p><p>Bukele, who has courted American conservatives, has offered to jail not just Americans but nationals from third countries, along with Salvadorans.</p><p>Trump quickly after taking office stripped roughly 600,000 Venezuelans in the United States of protection from deportation.</p><p>Trump&#39;s predecessor Joe Biden had refused to deport them due to the security and economic crises in Venezuela, led by leftist Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>Some 232,000 Salvadorans enjoy similar protections in the United States which Trump has not touched.</p><p>The Trump administration has also begun to fly detained migrants to the US military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</p><p>burs-sct/</p></div></article></div>",

(She did not take the offer.)</p><p>Late Sunday night, Jasmine got an email from someone in Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) telling her not to work in-person on Monday. After business hours that night, she received the same instructions via email for Tuesday.</p><p>Now Jasmine doesn’t know what’s going on. Sidelined at home, she’s disturbed by reports that Musk’s deputies are trying to enter her physical office and gain access to its systems. One of her colleagues is stranded in Nairobi without access to their work email or a way to get home.</p><p>“It’s only been two weeks. Only two and a half weeks of everything,” she said, referring to the new administration. “All of the emails are coming out very late in the day or in the middle of the night with very little warning. It’s definitely a very markedly different tone from any agency notices that have gone out prior to this time, as long as I’ve been working at USAID.”</p><p>USAID, the federal government’s primary humanitarian aid agency, is the tip of the spear in Donald Trump’s escalating war against his own government.

Most of the federal government is there by law.<span class=\"attribution\">Elaine Kamark, senior policy adviser to President Bill Clinton and lecturer at Harvard University</span></p></blockquote></div><p><span>Sarah Binder, a George Washington University political science professor and a fellow at the centrist Brookings Institute agreed that Trump is engaged in an “intense, precise effort to hoard power in the executive branch and diminish any challenges to his executive power. That’s clearly the motion and the intent coming from Trump and his advisors.”</span></p><p><span>Kevin Kosar, a senior fellow at the center-right American Enterprise Institute, said Trump is trying to foster a less liberal federal workforce — a draining of the so-called swamp that Trump promised, but did not deliver, in his first term.</span></p><p><span>“Certainly there’s this perception of — whether you call it a deep state or just a professional political class that has a liberal bent, that is embedded in the federal government,” he said. “This view holds that they direct executive branch authority in ways they see fit. That they reward organizations outside the government with grants. And that this whole kind of ‘blob’ as it’s often called is just not responsive to the people, not [responsive] to Congress — and during the first Trump administration was largely unresponsive to the president. And so this new administration is just taking a very big run at this entity.”</span></p><h2><strong>Is any of this legal?</strong></h2><p><span>That’s what we’ll find out in the weeks and months ahead, as the courts and legislative branch sort out how to respond to Trump’s sweeping mandates — while Trump’s primary tactic in the meantime is to overwhelm and confuse.</span></p><p><span>The president cannot unilaterally get rid of an agency legislated into existence by Congress. But Trump is testing the degree to which he can get around programs that aren’t protected under statute.</span></p><p><span>“I mean, much of this, on the face of it, is aptly illegal,” Kamark said. “There are rules for how you lay off people in the federal government, if you decide to do a reduction in force. You don’t decide the Education Department doesn’t exist anymore. The problem these people will face is that most of the federal government does not exist to irritate Donald Trump or any other president. Most of the federal government is there by law.”</span></p><p><span>Kosar said Trump and Republicans are snatching power in a way that could backfire once a Democrat is back in the White House.</span></p><p><span>“There’s a way to do this within the Constitution and the law. If you just rely on presidential unilateralism with a weak legal basis — congratulations, you’re creating a precedent,” Kosar said. “And the next time we have a Democrat in the White House, that’s going to be a basis for Democratic unilateral presidential action. Is that really what you want?”</span></p><p>Binder said Trump seems to have no interest in following the law and respecting the balance of powers.</p><p>“That is entirely new,” Binder said. “When all is said and done, is this effort going to be ground down the way most overreaching gets ground down in American politics” — through delay, political bottlenecks, court fights and public opposition?</p><h2><strong>What about Congress?</strong></h2><p><span>Congressional Republicans, who control both the House and Senate for the next two years, have not given much of an indication they plan to stand in Trump’s way, though some seemed uneasy with the general lack of program review.</span></p><p><span>“They’re going to see how far they can go,” </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-back-seat-trump-steamroll-congress-unilateral-moves-rcna190465\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Sen.

Schiefelbein)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Tuesday doubled-down on a sweeping freeze of most US aid, alleging that groups decrying the human impact may be deliberately trying to score political points.</p><p>But Rubio, on a Latin America tour, also said he was issuing waivers which would allow for &quot;immediate&quot; and &quot;life-saving&quot; aid to continue after President Donald Trump ordered a 90-day suspension on taking office.</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know how much more clear we can be than that,&quot; he told reporters in Costa Rica.</p><p>&quot;I would say if some organization is receiving funds from the United States and does not know how to apply a waiver, then I have real questions about the competence of that organization, or I wonder whether they&#39;re deliberately sabotaging it for purposes of making a political point,&quot; said Rubio, a former Republican senator who long voted for foreign assistance.</p><p>A day earlier, Rubio said he had been made acting head of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) as Trump looks at integrating it under the State Department.</p><p>Non-governmental organizations say they have heard multiple cases of aid groups that have struggled to operate, mostly smaller, local organizations that did not have reserves.</p><p>Others fear long-term damage in areas that go far beyond food supplies, such as education and long-term relief work.</p><p>Some schools have shuttered in Uganda, where USAID was backing a universal education program, and demining work has been disrupted in Cambodia, among other cases.</p><p>In Geneva, Jens Laerke, a spokesman for United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA, said that the Trump administration was creating a &quot;state of confusion.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;Not charity&#39; -</p><p>Elon Musk, the billionaire tech entrepreneur who advises Trump, has vowed to kill USAID, saying it is run by &quot;radical lunatics.&quot;</p><p>USAID managed more than $40 billion in the 2023 fiscal year. The United States has long been the world&#39;s top donor, with previous leaders seeing it as a key tool in increasing US influence.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Rubio, who as a senator was largely supportive of foreign assistance, said his goal was not to end aid but to narrow it to where it advances &quot;the national interest.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have long supported foreign aid. I continue to support foreign aid.&nbsp;But foreign aid is not charity,&quot; Rubio said.</p><p>Rubio announced that he was issuing new waivers to ensure the flow of assistance to Costa Rica, a major US partner on issues including migration and drug-trafficking.</p><p>US assistance includes biometric work to stop smugglers, which Rubio pointed out as an example of concrete American help that benefits its own interests.</p><p>&quot;Under President Trump, we have a foreign policy in which we are strong in providing support to our allies,&quot; Rubio said as he met Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves.</p><p>- Pushing on China -</p><p>The top US diplomat, on his third stop in his first trip, is a longtime China hawk who is also looking to push back on Beijing&#39;s influence in the region.</p><p>Costa Rica in 2007 switched recognition to China from Taiwan, the self-governing democracy claimed by Beijing -- a turning point as other Latin American countries followed suit.</p><p>But US officials also see hope in the example of Costa Rica, whose relations with China have turned rockier in recent years.</p><p>Chaves in 2023 effectively forbade Chinese tech titan Huawei from bidding for the nation&#39;s 5G network due to Beijing&#39;s refusal to sign an international agreement on cybercrime.</p><p>&quot;When you confront companies that are not secure, they&#39;re backed by governments like the government of China that likes to threaten, that likes to sabotage, that likes to use economic coercion to punish you,&quot; Rubio said.</p><p>Costa Rica has been &quot;very firm, and I think they deserve a lot of support in confronting that,&quot; Rubio said.</p><p>Rubio later flew to Guatemala, the most populous nation that still recognizes Taiwan.</p><p>sct/md</p></div></article></div>",
