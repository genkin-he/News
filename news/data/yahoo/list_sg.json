his return to the White House (Jim WATSON)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump will discuss the future of the Gaza ceasefire Tuesday as the Israeli prime minister becomes the first foreign leader to visit the White House since the US president&#39;s return to power.</p><p>Netanyahu is in Washington for talks with the new Trump administration on a second, longer-term phase of Israel&#39;s fragile truce with the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which has not yet been finalized.</p><p>Trump has meanwhile repeatedly touted a plan to &quot;clean out&quot; Gaza, calling for Palestinians to move to neighboring countries such as Egypt or Jordan, despite all those parties strongly rejecting his proposal.</p><p>Before leaving for Washington, Netanyahu said that Israel&#39;s wars with Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and its confrontations with Iran had &quot;redrawn the map&quot; in the Middle East.</p><p>&quot;But I believe that working closely with President Trump we can redraw it even further, and for the better,&quot; Netanyahu said.</p><p>The White House meeting promises to be a crucial one for a region shattered by war since Hamas&#39;s deadly October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel.</p><p>Netanyahu hailed the fact that he would be the first foreign leader to meet Trump since his January 20 inauguration as &quot;testimony to the strength of the Israeli-American alliance.&quot;</p><p>The Israeli premier had tense relations with Trump&#39;s predecessor Joe Biden over the growing death toll in Gaza, despite Biden&#39;s steadfast maintenance of US military aid.</p><p>But Trump, who has claimed credit for sealing the ceasefire after 15 months of war and prides himself on his dealmaking ability, will be pushing Netanyahu to stick to the agreement.</p><p>He is also expected to lean on Netanyahu to accept a deal to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia, something he tried to do in his first term.</p><p>- &#39;No guarantees&#39; -</p><p>Trump said Sunday that talks with Israel and other Middle Eastern countries were &quot;progressing&quot; -- but then warned less than 24 hours later that there that were &quot;no guarantees that the peace is going to hold.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Trump&#39;s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff -- who met Netanyahu on Monday over terms for the second phase of the Gaza truce -- said however that he was &quot;certainly hopeful&quot; that the truce would stick.</p><p>Hamas officials have said they were ready to begin talks on the details of the second phase, which is expected to cover the release of the remaining captives and could lead to a more permanent end to the war.</p><p>But Trump&#39;s sudden floating of a plan to move people out of Gaza -- which he describes as a &quot;demolition site&quot; -- has added further uncertainty to an already tense and difficult situation.</p><p>Trump said the plan could be temporary or permanent, but the mass displacement of civilians from Gaza was strongly rejected by Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinians, and ceasefire mediator Qatar.</p><p>Under the Gaza ceasefire&#39;s 42-day first phase, Hamas is to free 33 hostages in staggered releases in exchange for around 1,900 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.</p><p>Four hostage-prisoner exchanges have already taken place, and the truce has led to a surge of food, fuel, medical and other aid into rubble-strewn Gaza, as well as allowing displaced Gazans to return to the territory&#39;s north.</p><p>Hamas&#39;s October 2023 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p><p>Israel&#39;s retaliatory response has killed at least 47,498 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory&#39;s health ministry.</p><p>Israel has meanwhile turned its focus to the occupied West Bank and an operation it says is aimed at rooting out extremism that has killed dozens.</p><p>dk/mlm</p></div></article></div>",

of options if it wants to reply to fresh US levies.</p><p>US President Donald Trump over the weekend announced 10 percent tariffs on Chinese products, upping the stakes in a trade confrontation between the global superpowers that started eight years ago in his first term.</p><p>Beijing in response warned there were &quot;no winners&quot; in a trade war and vowed as yet unspecified countermeasures.</p><p>News that Canada and Mexico had agreed a deal with Trump to delay 25 percent tariffs on their goods was followed by his announcement that he would be holding talks with China &quot;probably in the next 24 hours&quot; to try for an agreement.</p><p>But, as the threat of new measures continues to hang over Beijing, eyes are on what officials there have lined up as a response.</p><p>With its economy still struggling with sluggish consumption and slow growth, observers expect China to keep its powder dry for now -- at least until another round of tariffs that could do greater damage.</p><p>&quot;We expect China not to jump to immediate retaliation following the 10 percent tariff hike, but will keep the doors of negotiation and cooperation open,&quot; UBS bank analysts wrote in a note.</p><p>&quot;We do not expect China to follow the same strategy as in the first round of tariff hikes in 2018-19.&quot;</p><p>Bilateral trade totalled more than $530 billion in 2024, according to US data, with exports of Chinese goods to the United States exceeding $400 billion. That was second only to Mexico.</p><p>But that yawning trade imbalance -- $270.4 billion in January-November last year -- has long raised hackles in Washington.</p><p>- Lesson learned? -</p><p>Key US demands in the first trade war were greater access to China&#39;s markets, broad reform of a business playing field that heavily favours Chinese firms, and a loosening of heavy state controls.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>This time around Washington has also called for China to crack down on exports to Mexico of chemical components used to make the synthetic opioid fentanyl, responsible for tens of thousands of overdose deaths a year.</p><p>After long, fraught negotiations during Trump&#39;s first term the two agreed what became known as the &quot;phase one&quot; deal -- a ceasefire in the nearly two-year-old trade war.</p><p>Beijing was quick to retaliate throughout that standoff -- imposing tariffs of its own on everything from cars to soybeans, designed to inflict harm on Trump&#39;s voting base in rural America.</p><p>It also floated restrictions on exports of rare earth metals, of which China dominates global supplies and on which the United States remains heavily dependent.</p><p>And should a new trade war escalate, &quot;measures could include tariffs, export controls on critical minerals essential for US manufacturing, restricted market access to US firms operating in China, or the depreciation of the yuan&quot;, Harry Murphy Cruise, head of China and Australia economics at Moody&#39;s Analytics, told AFP.</p><p>But he added Beijing may have learned its lesson from the first standoff.</p><p>&quot;The tit-for-tat trade war in Trump&#39;s first term benefited no one; it made trade more costly and hindered growth in both countries,&quot; Murphy Cruise said.</p><p>- China&#39;s weaker position -</p><p>For now, analysts believe the latest measures won&#39;t bite too hard.</p><p>&quot;The 10 percent tariff is not a big shock to China&#39;s economy,&quot; Zhang Zhiwei at Pinpoint Asset Management said in a note.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s unlikely to change the market expectation on China&#39;s macro outlook this year, which already factored in higher tariffs from the US,&quot; he added.</p><p>And that could allow China to keep its powder dry in the event Trump&#39;s first wave of tariffs are the prelude to a bigger showdown.</p><p>The US president has ordered an in-depth review of Chinese trade practices, the results of which are due by April 1.</p><p>That could serve as a &quot;catalyst for more tariffs&quot;, said Murphy Cruise, pushing Beijing to shift tactics.</p><p>&quot;This strategy of no retaliation may change if the US imposes additional significant tariffs later on,&quot; UBS economists said.</p><p>&quot;In such a case, we think China may retaliate on a targeted basis and in a restrained manner, imposing tariffs on selected agricultural products, auto parts, energy,&quot; they said.</p><p>Experts added that China could also let the value of its currency devalue, increasing the competitiveness of its exports.</p><p>Trump&#39;s flagged talks with Beijing offer the two sides a chance to step back from the brink of a trade war that could hit hundreds of billions&#39; worth of goods.</p><p>&quot;China is looking to diffuse tensions,&quot; Murphy Cruise said.</p><p>&quot;China&#39;s economy is in a much weaker position this time around; it will be substantially harder to withstand a barrage of tariffs.&quot;</p><p>aas-oho/dan</p></div></article></div>",

with Sheinbaum he would &quot;immediately pause&quot; the tariffs on Mexico, and that his counterpart had agreed to send 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico frontier.</p><p>Tensions appeared higher between the United States and Canada -- but after two calls with Trudeau, Trump said on Truth Social that Canada had &quot;agreed to ensure we have a secure Northern Border, and to finally end the deadly scourge of drugs like Fentanyl.&quot;</p><p>Trudeau said Canada would deploy nearly 10,000 frontline officers to help secure the border, list drug cartels as terrorists, appoint a &quot;Fentanyl Czar&quot; and crack down on money laundering.</p><p>It was not clear the real extent of the changes on the Canadian border, given that authorities said in December they already had 8,500 personnel

John Kennedy (R-La.) told reporters on Monday. “Because that’s why we’re elected ― to review all the spending.”</p><p>Over the weekend, agents of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which is led by billionaire Elon Musk, effectively shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development, locking its employees out of their computers, barring them from their offices and halting its work delivering humanitarian assistance abroad. The Tesla CEO then accused the agency of being a “<a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1886102414194835755\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:criminal organization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">criminal organization</a>” that should “die.”</p><p>Newly confirmed Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a Republican proponent of USAID’s mission during his time serving the Senate, also <a href=\"https://x.com/HowardMortman/status/1886471530525139047\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:announced;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">announced</a> on Monday he is taking over as acting director of USAID to overhaul its funding and operations. The agency, he said, would be consolidated under the State Department with the consultation of Congress.</p><p>Democratic lawmakers and legal experts warned the Trump administration has no authority to dissolve or consolidate the USAID, an independent government agency. They said that such efforts are unconstitutional and are likely to face challenges in court.</p><p>“A president is not a king,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said. “Trump cannot eliminate USAID with the stroke of a pen. Not only is it illegal — it is a gift to our adversaries.”</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, maintained he doesn’t need approval from Congress to eliminate an agency or freeze funding approved by the legislative branch.</p><p>“I don’t think so. Not when it comes to fraud,” Trump told reporters on Monday. These people are lunatics, and if it comes to fraud, you wouldn’t have an act of Congress. I’m not sure you would anyway.”</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>USAID has an annual budget of more than $50 billion ― or less than 1% of the entire federal budget. It was established by Congress in 1961 and has been a key tool in U.S. foreign policy to combat the influence of adversaries across the globe, including China, Russia and Iran.</p><p>The disruption of funding at the agency has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/01/foreign-aid-freeze-state-department-usaid/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:already halted aid programs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">already halted aid programs</a> that provide essential help to millions of people around the world, including those in need of food, health care, education and human rights.</p><p>Republican senators indicated on Monday that they support a review of USAID spending they believe to be wasteful while preserving the agency’s core functions.</p><p>“At the end the day, if you just shut down every program in there, I think it’s a mistake, and I think it’ll have policy and political consequences,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) told HuffPost.</p><p>Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said he backed a review of USAID “to make sure that taxpayer dollars are going to programs and people that are consistent with our government’s policies.”</p><p>The Texas Republican acknowledged, however, that for the agency “to be absorbed into the State Department, it requires congressional action.”</p><p>Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) noted USAID “does a lot of good around the world, particularly for women and girls.” The senator had questions about attempts to eliminate it, however.</p><p>“I think this is the question that we’re asking, is just, the legality?” she said.</p><p>One GOP senator, Jerry Moran of Kansas, warned the freeze in USAID programs threatened to spoil food assistance to poorer countries abroad.</p><p>“I urge [Rubio] to distribute the $340 million in American-grown food currently stalled in U.S. ports to reach those in need,” Moran wrote in a post online.</p><p>“Time is running out before this life-saving aid perishes,” the senator added.</p><p>Democrats said Trump’s attempts to stifle federal agencies and cancel congressionally approved spending were directly related to his earlier <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/us/politics/trump-inspectors-general-fired.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:firings of inspectors general from 18 federal agencies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">firings of inspectors general from 18 federal agencies</a> who were tasked with rooting out corruption and abuse in government.</p><p>“They got rid of the watchdogs, and then they stormed the building and got rid of the servers and the data,” Sen.

It has no authority to make spending decisions. It has no authority to shut programs down or to ignore federal law,” Schumer said.</p><h3>Related...</h3><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-usaid-security-officials-on-leave-doge-classified-info_n_679fad44e4b0bbecdd65341b\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Elon Musk Claims Trump Has &#39;Agreed&#39; USAID Should Be Shut Down;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Elon Musk Claims Trump Has &#39;Agreed&#39; USAID Should Be Shut Down</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/usaid-marco-rubio-in-charge_n_67a11732e4b011abdd2dcf7a\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Marco Rubio Accuses USAID Of ‘Insubordination,’ Claims He’s Now In Charge;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Marco Rubio Accuses USAID Of ‘Insubordination,’ Claims He’s Now In Charge</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/social-security-administration-stops-issuing-sex-marker-changes-after-trump-order_n_67a158d3e4b06968585a0ec1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Social Security Administration Stops Issuing Sex Marker Changes After Trump Order;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Social Security Administration Stops Issuing Sex Marker Changes After Trump Order</a></p></li></ul></div></article></div>",

struggles with AI challenges from the United States and China.</p><p>Players from across the sector and representatives from 80 nations will gather in the French capital on February 10 and 11 in the sumptuous Grand Palais, built for the 1900 Universal Exhibition.</p><p>In the run-up, President Emmanuel Macron will on February 4 visit research centres applying AI to science and health, before hosting scientists and Nobel Prize winners at his Elysee Palace residence on Wednesday.</p><p>A wider science conference will be held at the Polytechnique engineering school on Thursday and Friday.</p><p>&quot;The summit comes at exactly the right time for this wake-up call for France and Europe, and to show we are in position&quot; to take advantage of the technology, an official in Macron&#39;s office told reporters.</p><p>In recent weeks, Washington&#39;s announcement of $500 billion in investment to build up AI infrastructure and the release of a frugal but powerful generative AI model by Chinese firm DeepSeek have focussed minds in Europe.</p><p>France must &quot;not let this revolution pass it by&quot;, Macron&#39;s office said.</p><p>Attendees at the summit will include Sam Altman, head of OpenAI -- the firm that brought generative models to public consciousness in 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT.</p><p>Google boss Sundar Pichai and Nobel Prize winner Demis Hassabis, who leads the company&#39;s DeepMind AI research unit, will also come, alongside Arthur Mensch, founder of French AI developer Mistral.</p><p>The Elysee has said there are &quot;talks&quot; on hosting DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng, and has yet to clarify whether X owner Elon Musk -- who has his own generative initiative, xAI -- has accepted an invitation.</p><p>Nor is it clear who will attend from the United States and China, with the French presidency saying only &quot;very high level&quot; representatives will come.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Confirmed guests from Europe include European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.</p><p>- &#39;Stoke confidence&#39; -</p><p>The tone of the AI summit will be &quot;neither catastrophizing, nor naive,&quot; Macron&#39;s AI envoy Anne Bouverot told AFP.</p><p>Hosting the conference is also an opportunity for Paris to show off its own AI ecosystem, which numbers around 750 companies.</p><p>Macron&#39;s office has said the summit would see the announcement of &quot;massive&quot; investments along the lines of his annual &quot;Choose France&quot; business conference, at which 15 billion euros ($15.4 billion) of inward investment were pledged in 2024.</p><p>Beyond the economic opportunities, AI&#39;s impact on culture including artistic creativity and news production will be discussed in a side-event over the weekend.</p><p>Debates open to the public, such as that one, are aimed at showing off &quot;positive use cases for AI&quot; to &quot;stoke confidence and speed up adoption&quot; of the technology, said France&#39;s digital minister Clara Chappaz.</p><p>For now the French public is sceptical of AI, with 79 percent of respondents telling pollsters Ifop they were &quot;concerned&quot; about the technology in a recent survey.</p><p>- More &#39;inclusive&#39; AI? -</p><p>Paris says it also hopes the summit can help kick off its vision of a more ethical and accessible and less resource-intensive AI.</p><p>At present, &quot;the AI under development is pushed by a few large players from a few countries&quot;, Bouverot said, whereas France wants &quot;to promote more inclusive development&quot;.</p><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been invited to co-host the Paris summit, in a push to bring governments on board.</p><p>One of the summit&#39;s aims is the establishment of a public-interest foundation for which Paris aims to raise 2.5 billion euros over five years.</p><p>The effort would be &quot;a public-private partnership between various governments, businesses and philanthropic foundations from different countries&quot;, Macron&#39;s office said.</p><p>Paris hopes at the summit to chart different efforts at AI governance around the world and gather commitments for environmentally sustainable AI -- although no binding mechanism is planned for now.</p><p>&quot;There are lots of big principles emerging around responsible, trustworthy AI, but
