Kennedy Jr, squeaked through a crucial vote in his confirmation bid on Tuesday as senators advanced his nomination to the floor.</p><p>With Republicans having a one-seat advantage on the Senate Finance Committee, Kennedy&#39;s future hinged on Bill Cassidy, a physician who has clashed with the former Democrat over unfounded claims linking vaccines to autism.</p><p>But Cassidy backed Kennedy after the 71-year-old environmental lawyer -- and nephew of former president John F. Kennedy -- was given a vote of confidence from Trump, who urged support for the man whom just nine months ago he was calling &quot;one of the most Liberal Lunatics ever to run for office.&quot;</p><p>&quot;20 years ago, Autism in children was 1 in 10,000. NOW IT&#39;S 1 in 34. WOW! Something&#39;s really wrong. We need BOBBY!!!&quot; Trump posted on his Truth Social platform ahead of the vote.</p><p>Cassidy is a rare occasional rebel in the Republican ranks but faces reelection next year in Louisiana and risked picking up a challenger from the Republican Party&#39;s Trumpist far right if he upset the president.</p><p>Kennedy&#39;s nomination has faced myriad concerns from both parties, with Republicans particularly eying his past support for abortion, his record suing big business as an environmental lawyer and his 2023 run for president as a Democrat.</p><p>Beyond vaccines, Democrats point mainly to sexual misconduct allegations, Kennedy&#39;s suggestion that Covid-19 was designed to spare Jews, his linking of school shootings to antidepressants and his alleged mistreatment of animal corpses.</p><p>The New York Post, a reliably Trump-supporting newspaper, wrote a scathing editorial arguing that there was &quot;too much wackiness&quot; in Kennedy&#39;s background to trust him with America&#39;s health.</p><p>- Iron grip -</p><p>And Elizabeth Warren, the vice chair of the Senate Democrats, called Kennedy an &quot;anti-science conspiracy peddler who is willing to gamble with American lives,&quot; urging senators to reject the nomination.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The Senate can confirm nominees without a committee&#39;s endorsement, but Republican Majority Leader John Thune had cast doubt on how likely this was.</p><p>That raised the stakes for Tulsi Gabbard -- another conspiracy theorist with a long record of publicly opposing US national security policy, including siding with its adversaries -- who scraped through her own key vote.</p><p>Like Kennedy, 43-year-old Gabbard was running the gauntlet of a party-line vote and just a single Republican no would have sunk her chances of endorsement by the Senate Intelligence Committee. </p><p>But Susan Collins, Todd Young and Jerry Moran -- considered the swing votes -- all lined up behind the Hawaiian US Army Reserve officer, clearing her path to the Senate floor by nine votes to eight.</p><p>Collins said the one-time lawmaker -- like Kennedy, a former Democrat who once ran for president -- had addressed her concerns over her past support for pardoning NSA leaker Edward Snowden.</p><p>Success for Kennedy and Gabbard, two of the least experienced nominees in modern history, would be another powerful demonstration of Trump&#39;s iron grip on his party, days after controversial Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth&#39;s confirmation.</p><p>The Senate confirmed former congressman Doug Collins -- no relation of the senator -- as secretary of Veterans Affairs on Tuesday, a day after approving fracking executive Chris Wright to lead the Energy Department.</p><p>Pam Bondi is expected to be confirmed as attorney general in the early hours of Wednesday, replacing fellow Floridian Trump loyalist Matt Gaetz, who was the president&#39;s first choice.</p><p>Gaetz, who withdrew amid allegations of drug abuse and sex with an underage girl that he denies, is looking set to be the only Trump nominee whose Cabinet ambitions will have been derailed in Congress.</p><p>ft/des</p></div></article></div>",

Tuesday, a move that would stop $13.3 million in pending aid.</p><p>&quot;We received an official notification from the US asking for an immediate stop work order on their contribution to the multinational security support force,&quot; said Stephane Dujarric, the UN secretary-general&#39;s spokesperson, referring to the already underfunded Kenya-led force.</p><p>The UN Security Council gave the green light in October 2023 to the Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission designed to support Haiti&#39;s authorities in their fight against criminal gangs, which control swaths of the country.</p><p>Washington&#39;s funding freeze comes as part of newly elected President Donald Trump&#39;s push to slash US overseas aid, a drive that has included an effort to shutter the operations of the government&#39;s main aid agency, USAID.</p><p>In late January, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that Haiti&#39;s capital could become overrun by gangs if the international community does not step up aid to the security mission.</p><p>More money, equipment and personnel are needed for the international force, Guterres said, adding that any further delays risk the &quot;catastrophic&quot; collapse of Haiti&#39;s security institutions and &quot;could allow gangs to overrun the entire metropolitan area&quot; of the capital Port-au-Prince.</p><p>Haiti&#39;s Foreign Minister Jean-Victor Harvel Jean-Baptiste, speaking at a meeting of the UN Security Council, has said that the country faced &quot;major difficulties&quot; that threaten not just the population but also &quot;the very survival of the state.&quot;</p><p>The MSS is not a UN force, but the UN has set up a voluntary fund to finance it, which has raised $110 million to date, an amount that has been deemed largely insufficient.</p><p>Just under 800 of the 2,500 security personnel hoped for have been deployed.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button

the second-largest contribution, after Canada&#39;s $63 million -- with $1.7 million already disbursed.</p><p>Haiti currently has no president or parliament and is ruled by a transitional body, which is struggling to manage extreme violence linked to criminal gangs, poverty and other challenges.</p><p>More than 5,626 people were killed in Haiti last year as a result of gang violence, about a thousand more than in 2023, the UN said.</p><p>More than a million Haitians have been forced to flee their homes, three times as many as a year ago.</p><p>abd-aha/st</p></div></article></div>",

(-)</figcaption></div></figure><p>US President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are expected to hold direct talks after announcing tit-for-tat tariffs in an escalating trade war, US officials said Tuesday.</p><p>Beijing said it was imposing levies on imports of US energy, vehicles and equipment in a return salvo minutes after Trump&#39;s threatened tariffs on Chinese goods came into effect.</p><p>Trump suspended duties on Mexico and Canada on Monday for a month after both countries vowed to step up measures to counter flows of the drug fentanyl and the crossing of undocumented migrants into the United States.</p><p>It was not immediately clear when the leaders of the world&#39;s two biggest economies would speak, although some said it could happen as early as Tuesday.</p><p>Stock markets wavered as investors braced for volatile market activity in the coming weeks over Trump&#39;s threatened tariffs on his country&#39;s three biggest trading partners.</p><p>&quot;Let&#39;s see what happens with the call today,&quot; Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro, a veteran of the US president&#39;s first term, told news outlet Politico.</p><p>Asked if Trump could halt the tariffs on China too, he added: &quot;It&#39;s up to the boss. I never get ahead of the boss, that&#39;s why I&#39;m sitting here.&quot;</p><p>Trump imposed fresh 10-percent tariffs on Chinese goods, on top of levies that were already in place against Washington&#39;s biggest economic competitor. Mexico and Canada had faced 25-percent tariffs.</p><p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that Trump was due to talk to Xi, but said Tuesday that &quot;I don&#39;t have any updates on when that call will take place.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He is not going to allow China to continue to source and distribute deadly fentanyl into our country, that was the reason for this tariff,&quot; Leavitt told reporters outside the West Wing of the White House.</p><p>- &#39;Malicious&#39; -</p><p>China unveiled 15-percent levies on imports of coal and liquefied natural gas from the United States, while crude oil, agricultural machinery, big-engined vehicles, and pickup trucks face 10-percent duties.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Beijing says it will also probe US tech giant Google and the US fashion group that owns Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein.</p><p>China&#39;s government said the measures were in response to the &quot;unilateral tariff hike&quot; by Washington. It said it would also file a complaint to the World Trade Organization over the &quot;malicious&quot; levies.</p><p>Additionally, it unveiled fresh export controls on rare metals and chemicals including tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, and molybdenum, used in a range of industrial appliances.</p><p>China is a major market for US energy exports and according to Beijing customs data, imports of oil, coal and LNG totaled more than $7 billion last year.</p><p>But that is dwarfed by China&#39;s imports from more friendly powers such as Russia, from which it purchased $94 billion-worth last year.</p><p>- Last-minute deals -</p><p>Trump has made tariffs a key foreign policy tool of his second term, joking that the word tariff is the &quot;most beautiful&quot; in the dictionary.</p><p>The Republican billionaire said his tariffs aimed to punish countries for failing to halt flows of illegal migrants and drugs including the powerful opioid fentanyl into the United States.</p><p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had both struck last-minute deals with Trump on Monday to tighten border measures, leading to a 30-day pause on threatened tariffs.</p><p>Talks will continue for the next month on broader pacts.</p><p>Mexico said Tuesday it had begun the 10,000-strong border troop deployment it had promised Trump as part of the agreement to halt tariffs.</p><p>&quot;The deployment has already started,&quot; Sheinbaum told reporters.</p><p>More than 450,000 people have been murdered countrywide since Mexico launched a major offensive against drug cartels in 2006.</p><p>Trudeau said Canada would appoint a &quot;Fentanyl Czar&quot; and list drug cartels as terrorist organizations.</p><p>burs-dk-bys/aha</p></div></article></div>",

the deadliest school attack in the Scandinavian country&#39;s history.</p><p>Authorities had initially said that several people were wounded in the violence at Campus Risbergska, a secondary school for young adults in the town of Orebro, but had not reported any fatalities.</p><p>School attacks are relatively rare in Sweden, but the country has suffered shootings and bombings linked to gang violence that kill dozens of people each year.</p><p>&quot;Around 10 people have been killed today,&quot; Orebro police chief Roberto Eid Forest told reporters, adding that police could &quot;not be more specific about the number due to the large number of wounded&quot;.</p><p>He provided no details about the number of wounded.</p><p>He said police were not aware of a motive yet, but believed the gunman had acted alone.</p><p>&quot;This is a terrible event. This is exceptional, a nightmare,&quot; Forest said.</p><p>Police did not disclose any information about the identity or ages of the dead, nor whether they were students or teachers at the school.</p><p>Several media reported the suspected gunman turned his gun on himself but police would not confirm those reports.</p><p>- &#39;A lot of gunshots&#39; -</p><p>Forest said police received the first reports of a school shooting at 12:33 pm (1133 GMT), but could not specify how it unfolded.</p><p>&quot;We have been working on the basis that there was ongoing deadly violence inside the school,&quot; Forest said.</p><p>The attacker is also believed to have carried some form of equipment to create smoke inside the school, he added. </p><p>Two Campus Risbergska teachers, Miriam Jarlevall and Patrik Soderman, told newspaper Dagens Nyheter they heard gunfire in a hallway.</p><p>&quot;Students came and said someone was shooting. Then we heard more shooting in the hallway. We didn&#39;t go out, we hid in our offices,&quot; they said.</p><p>&quot;There were a lot of gunshots at first and then it was quiet for a half-hour and then it started again. We were lying under our desks, cowering.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Some witnesses told Swedish media they heard what they believed to be automatic gunfire.</p><p>Swedish television channel TV4 meanwhile reported that police had raided the suspect&#39;s home in Orebro late on Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>It said the suspect was around 35 years old and had a license to carry a weapon and no criminal record, but did not provide any details about his identity.</p><p>Police have not confirmed that information.</p><p>A church near the school was open Tuesday evening to provide support to the community.</p><p>- Schools in lockdown -</p><p>Students in several nearby schools as well as the one in question had been locked in for several hours &quot;for safety reasons&quot; before gradually being released, police said.</p><p>&quot;It is a very painful day for all of Sweden,&quot; Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson wrote on X.</p><p>&quot;My thoughts are also with all those whose normal school day was replaced with horror. Being confined to a classroom fearing for your own life is a nightmare that no one should have to experience.&quot;</p><p>Kristersson, who said the government was &quot;closely monitoring developments&quot;, was to hold a press conference at 7:30 pm (1830 GMT).</p><p>A mother whose son was kept indoors at his nearby school for several hours during the police operation told AFP she was &quot;shocked&quot; and &quot;angry&quot;.</p><p>&quot;My son is at this school behind us, they&#39;re locked in too. They have to hide, so I&#39;m waiting for them to evacuate,&quot; Cia Sandell, 42, said.</p><p>&quot;This is crazy, totally crazy. I&#39;m angry, I&#39;m shocked. This shouldn&#39;t happen,&quot; she said.</p><p>Though such shootings are rare, several other violent incidents have struck Swedish schools in recent years.</p><p>In March 2022, an 18-year-old student stabbed two teachers to death at a secondary school in the southern city of Malmo.</p><p>Two months earlier, a 16-year-old was arrested after wounding another student and a teacher with a knife at a school in the small town of Kristianstad.</p><p>In October 2015, three people were killed in a racially-motivated attack at a school in the western town of Trollhattan by a sword-wielding assailant who was later killed by police.</p><p>bur-po/jll/db</p></div></article></div>",
