seizing a mining town in South Kivu province, as they resumed their advance towards the regional capital Bukavu.</p><p>Just days after capturing the strategic city of Goma in neighbouring North Kivu, the M23 armed group had declared a unilateral humanitarian &quot;ceasefire&quot; to take effect from Tuesday.</p><p>The anti-government group announced at the same time it also had &quot;no intention of taking control of Bukavu or other localities&quot;.</p><p>But intense clashes broke out at dawn on Wednesday between the M23 with its Rwandan allies and Congolese armed forces, security and humanitarian sources told AFP.</p><p>The M23 fighters and Rwandan forces seized the mining town of Nyabibwe, about 100 kilometres (60 miles) from Bukavu and 70 kilometres from the province&#39;s airport.</p><p>&quot;This is proof that the unilateral ceasefire that has been declared was, as usual, a ploy,&quot; Congolese government spokesman Patrick Muyaya told AFP.</p><p>In more than three years of fighting between the Rwanda-backed group and the Congolese army, half a dozen ceasefires and truces have been declared, before being systematically broken.</p><p>Local and military sources said in recent days that both the DRC army and the M23 and its Rwandan allies were in the process of reinforcing troops and equipment in the region.</p><p>Last week&#39;s capture of Goma was a major escalation in the mineral-rich region, scarred by relentless conflict involving dozens of armed groups over three decades.</p><p>At least 900 people were killed in the Goma clashes and 2,880 wounded, according to the UN&#39;s humanitarian body.</p><p>Fears the violence could spark a wider conflict have galvanised regional bodies, mediators such as Angola and Kenya, as well as the United Nations, European Union and other countries in diplomatic efforts for a peaceful resolution.</p><p>Diplomatic sources say the survival of the government of Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi, who won a second term in December 2023, could also be at stake if the Rwanda-backed M23 continues to wrest control of more of the vast central African nation&#39;s east.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore

critics warn (YASUYOSHI CHIBA)</figcaption></div></figure><p>President Donald Trump&#39;s decision to freeze foreign assistance has sent aid staff in Africa into &quot;panic mode&quot;, with even HIV experimental treatment programmes stopped dead in their tracks.</p><p>Trump last week ordered a suspension of foreign assistance, while his billionaire ally Elon Musk has boasted he is putting the vast US humanitarian agency USAID &quot;through the woodchipper&quot;.</p><p>That has included a 90-day suspension of all work by the President&#39;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which alone supports more than 20 million HIV patients and 270,000 health workers, according to an analysis from the Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR).</p><p>Among its programmes, PEPFAR currently provides anti-retroviral treatments to 679,936 pregnant women living with HIV both for their own health and to prevent transmission to their children, the analysis said.</p><p>&quot;During a 90-day stoppage, we estimate that this would mean 135,987 babies acquiring HIV,&quot; it said.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has been named acting head of USAID, has said &quot;life-saving treatments&quot; would be exempt from the freeze.</p><p>But frontline workers in Africa say facilities have already shut down.</p><p>&quot;As we speak nothing is going on,&quot; said Aghan Daniel, head of a USAID-funded team of Kenyan science journalists providing information on health issues.</p><p>He told AFP research projects had abruptly stopped, even for patients midway through experimental treatment programmes.</p><p>He highlighted the MOSAIC (Maximizing Options to Advance Informed Choice for HIV Prevention) project, funded under PEPFAR, which tests new drugs and vaccines.</p><p>&quot;The people who were the study candidates are going to have adverse health results because the study has just stopped all of a sudden,&quot; Daniel told AFP.</p><p>His own team of six science journalists have all lost their jobs, too.</p><p>&quot;A lot of people are going to die because of lack of knowledge,&quot; he said. &quot;One of the key approaches to bringing down HIV numbers in Africa is through provision of information. This includes raising awareness about sex, as well as treatments like lenacapavir (an antiretroviral), pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis and other drugs.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>- &#39;Life and death&#39; -</p><p>Founded in 1961, USAID has an annual budget of more than $40 billion, used to support&nbsp;development, health and humanitarian programmes around the world, especially in poor countries.</p><p>It is not just HIV programmes that have shuttered.</p><p>A staff member of a USAID-funded programme in Kenya said Trump&#39;s decision had landed &quot;like a bombshell&quot;, throwing people &quot;into panic mode&quot;.</p><p>&quot;We will have more people succumbing to these diseases like tuberculosis, cholera,&quot; the source said.</p><p>The charity itself is now unable to pay rent or salaries, with employees put on compulsory unpaid leave.</p><p>At a USAID office in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, AFP saw people clearing out their desks on Wednesday.</p><p>Despite Rubio&#39;s waiver, &quot;a lot of uncertainty remains,&quot; said a staff member at an NGO working on food security in conflict zones, who asked to remain anonymous.</p><p>&quot;What constitutes life-saving work? Are vaccines life-saving, or nutrition programmes for the severely malnourished?&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;Stopping some of these programmes even for a few days could make the difference between life and death for some of the people we serve,&quot; he said.</p><p>Like others, Daniel said the impact could have been tempered with adequate notice.</p><p>&quot;We have too many emergencies in the world -– we didn&#39;t need to add another one,&quot; he said.</p><p>er/jhb</p></div></article></div>",

meeting with leaders in Panama and El Salvador (Johan ORDONEZ)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio was seeking cooperation on migration Wednesday in Guatemala, whose leader, an anti-corruption advocate, is eager to please the new US administration to bolster his standing at home.</p><p>Rubio is touring Latin America on his first trip which has been overshadowed by jaw-dropping actions in Washington by President Donald Trump, including dismantling the US Agency for International Development (USAID), of which Rubio is now nominally the head.</p><p>A former senator, Rubio is a Cuban-American and fierce opponent of Latin American leftists who has quickly sought in his new role to bolster US relationships with the region&#39;s conservatives.</p><p>An exception is Guatemala, where President Bernardo Arevalo is no ideological soulmate but has been eager to avoid friction with the new Trump administration.</p><p>Arevalo welcomed Rubio to dinner Tuesday in Guatemala City&#39;s old town and will hold further talks with him on Wednesday.</p><p>A sociologist and former diplomat born in exile after a US-backed 1954 coup, Arevalo is the son of a former president and pulled off a surprise victory in 2023 on a platform of reform and rooting out corruption in one of the region&#39;s poorest countries.</p><p>Arevalo immediately faced pushback from Guatemala&#39;s entrenched conservative elite which sought to prevent him from taking office.</p><p>Right-wing parties made allegations of electoral fraud, without providing evidence, and found support in Washington from elements of Trump&#39;s &quot;Stop the Steal&quot; movement that refused to acknowledge his 2020 defeat to Joe Biden.</p><p>Since Trump&#39;s political comeback, Arevalo has sought to avoid battles and has cooperated on the new US administration&#39;s push to expel millions of migrants.</p><p>Guatemala quickly accepted a military flight with deported citizens, shackled and flown in a military plane, unlike Colombia whose leftist leader pleaded for better treatment but backed down after Trump threatened massive retaliation.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Arevalo&#39;s administration &quot;frankly in two weeks has turned out to be an extraordinary ally particularly in helping us deal with migration issues,&quot; said Mauricio Claver-Carone, the US special envoy on Latin America.</p><p>Guatemala also appeals to the Trump administration as it is the most populous country that still recognizes Taiwan, the self-governing democracy claimed by China.</p><p>Rubio on a stop the day earlier to Costa Rica -- which switched recognition to China in 2007 -- vowed to support Latin American nations as they push back on China&#39;s influence.</p><p>China has wooed countries with major infrastructure projects in return for recognition, although Costa Rica has also faced economic retaliation after excluding Chinese telecom titan Huawei from consideration for its 5G network.</p><p>- Deportation, not aid -</p><p>Guatemala is one of the largest sources of migration to the United States after decades of poverty, violence and political instability.</p><p>The United States under previous administrations sought to address the root causes of migration through on-the-ground support.</p><p>USAID, whose officers around the world are being sent home by Trump, ran some $178 million in projects in Guatemala in 2023.</p><p>Around 700,000 Guatemalans are estimated to live in the United States without documentation, and many more legally.</p><p>Another source of migration is El Salvador, whose popular President Nayib Bukele has avidly courted the Trump administration.</p><p>Meeting Rubio on Monday, Bukele made the extraordinary offer to take prisoners from the United States including US citizens, an outsourcing of the prison system that has no recent historic precedent for a democratic country.</p><p>Bukele has succeeded in reducing crime through an unapologetic mass incarceration, which rights groups say has frequently included authorities without warrants rounding up innocent people.</p><p>Rubio late Wednesday will head to the Dominican Republic, whose president, Luis Abinader, has championed a Trump-style hard line on chronically unstable and impoverished Haiti, including by starting work on a wall and ramping up deportations.</p><p>The United States under Biden funded a multinational security force aimed at stabilizing Haiti, with Kenya taking the lead.</p><p>The United Nations said Tuesday that the Trump administration was cutting off aid to the Haiti effort.</p><p>sct/des</p></div></article></div>",

agencies, a top official said Wednesday, citing privacy and malware risks posed by China&#39;s breakout AI program.</p><p>The DeepSeek chatbot -- developed by a China-based startup -- has astounded industry insiders and upended financial markets since it was released last month.</p><p>But a growing list of countries including South Korea, Italy and France have voiced concerns about the application&#39;s security and data practices.</p><p>Australia upped the ante overnight banning DeepSeek from all government devices, one of the toughest moves against the Chinese chatbot yet.</p><p>&quot;This is an action the government has taken on the advice of security agencies. It&#39;s absolutely not a symbolic move,&quot; said government cyber security envoy Andrew Charlton.</p><p>&quot;We don&#39;t want to expose government systems to these applications.&quot;</p><p>Risks included that uploaded information &quot;might not be kept private&quot;, Charlton told national broadcaster ABC, and that applications such as DeepSeek &quot;may expose you to malware&quot;.</p><p>China on Wednesday rejected those claims and said it opposed the &quot;politicisation of economic, trade and technological issues&quot;.</p><p>&quot;The Chinese government... has never and will never require enterprises or individuals to illegally collect or store data,&quot; its foreign ministry said in a statement.</p><p>- &#39;Unacceptable&#39; risk -</p><p>Australia&#39;s Home Affairs department issued a directive to government employees overnight.</p><p>&quot;After considering threat and risk analysis, I have determined that the use of DeepSeek products, applications and web services poses an unacceptable level of security risk to the Australian Government,&quot; Department of Home Affairs Secretary Stephanie Foster said in the directive.</p><p>As of Wednesday all non-corporate Commonwealth entities must &quot;identify and remove all existing instances of DeepSeek products, applications and web services on all Australian Government systems and mobile devices,&quot; she added.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The directive also required that &quot;access, use or installation of DeepSeek products&quot; be prevented across government systems and mobile devices.</p><p>It has garnered bipartisan support among Australian politicians.</p><p>In 2018 Australia banned Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from its national 5G network, citing national security concerns.</p><p>TikTok was banned from government devices in 2023 on the advice of Australian intelligence agencies.</p><p>Cyber security researcher Dana Mckay said DeepSeek posed a genuine risk.</p><p>&quot;All Chinese companies are required to store their data in China.

the US and China have soared in recent days as the world&#39;s two largest economies slapped a volley of tariffs on each others&#39; imports, hitting hundreds of billions of dollars in trade.</p><p>As part of Trump&#39;s trade actions -- which he enacted citing drug trafficking concerns -- the United States on Tuesday scrapped a duty-free exemption for low-value packages.</p><p>The &quot;de minimis&quot; exemption allows goods valued at $800 or below to enter the United States without paying duties or certain taxes, but it has faced scrutiny due to a surge in shipments in recent years.</p><p>The US Customs and Border Protection agency said last month that exemption shipments were worth over $1.36 billion in 2024, creating challenges for its enforcement of trade laws, health and safety requirements, intellectual property rights, and consumer protection rules.</p><p>US officials have pointed to the growth of Chinese-founded online retailers Shein and Temu as a key factor behind the increase -- and Tuesday&#39;s halt threatened major delays to parcels from both companies from entering the country.</p><p>But Wednesday morning the USPS said it would &quot;continue accepting all international inbound mail and packages from China and Hong Kong Posts.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The USPS and Customs and Border Protection are working closely together to implement an efficient collection mechanism for the new China tariffs to ensure the least disruption to package delivery,&quot; it added, without further details.</p><p>Beijing had responded with fury to the move, accusing the US of &quot;politicizing trade and economic issues and using them as tools.&quot;</p><p>Vowing to &quot;take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies,&quot; foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian accused Washington of &quot;unreasonable suppression.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>AFP has reached out to Shein and Temu for comment.</p><p>Other retailers such as Amazon might also be impacted by the &quot;de minimis&quot; removal.</p><p>The low-cost retailers took another hit Wednesday as the European Commission announced it would seek to impose new fees on e-commerce imports -- the bulk of which come from China.</p><p>The measures are part of efforts to tackle a surge of &quot;harmful&quot; products into the bloc.</p><p>- Tariff standoff -</p><p>Tuesday saw Beijing say it would impose levies on imports of US energy, vehicles and equipment in a return salvo minutes after Trump&#39;s threatened tariffs on Chinese goods came into effect.</p><p>A day earlier, Trump suspended duties on Mexico and Canada for a month after both countries vowed to step up measures to counter flows of the drug fentanyl and the crossing of undocumented migrants into the United States.</p><p>Beijing&#39;s moves hit roughly $20 billion worth of US goods per year -- roughly 12 percent of total American imports into China, according to calculations by Capital Economics.</p><p>But their impact is a far cry from US tariffs announced over the weekend, which will affect some $450 billion worth of goods.</p><p>Although earlier it appeared that US parcels could still be sent from Macau, by Wednesday evening the semi-autonomous Chinese city&#39;s post office announced that its service was also suspended.</p><p>Trump had signalled earlier that the talks with Xi could take place early this week, but addressing reporters at the White House Tuesday afternoon, he said he was in &quot;no rush.&quot;</p><p>bur-des/sms</p></div></article></div>",

Amazon, plan to press ahead with plans for &quot;hyperscale&quot; data centres, and European corporations also need more AI-linked space.</p><p>&quot;Providers can&#39;t build supply fast enough to keep up with demand,&quot; Kevin Restivo, director of data centre research at consultancy CBRE, said in his keynote address at the Kickstart Europe conference.</p><p>Space shortages are most acute in the traditional big European data centre hubs of Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris and Dublin, where electric grid constraints are limiting capacity growth.</p><p>As a result, secondary markets are booming around Europe. Milan, Warsaw and Berlin are expanding the fastest in 2025, but firms are increasingly looking outside cities.</p><p>CBRE forecasts capacity coming online this year - measured in the data centre business by the amount of electricity needed to power it - will be around 9.1 gigawatts, with hyperscalers taking up more than a third.</p><p>CBRE estimates the average price across Europe to build &quot;colocation&quot; space, or space rented by big companies, inside a data centre at 12 million euros ($12.50 million) per megawatt.</p><p>That implies Europe&#39;s industry is expanding by more than 100 billion euros this year, but that pales beside ongoing U.S. investments, notably the &quot;Stargate&quot; initiative for Oracle, Microsoft and OpenAI to spend $500 billion over the next four years.</p><p>&quot;Europe risks falling into technological dependency, watching as AI leadership consolidates between the U.S. and China,&quot; Stijn Grove, managing director of the Dutch Data Center Association, said.</p><p>($1 = 0.9602 euros)</p><p>(Reporting by Toby Sterling; editing by Barbara Lewis)</p></div></article></div>",

Large software companies, such as Google and Amazon, plan to press ahead with plans for \"hyperscale\" data centres, and European corporations also need more AI-linked space.",

class=caas-body><p>NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Foreign companies have often struggled in India due to high tax demands related to duty evasion on imports or levies payable on big M&A transactions, leading to prolonged litigation at times.</p><p>Here are some of the key past and current tax disputes involving foreign companies:</p><p>KIA</p><p>South Korea&#39;s Kia has been accused of dodging $155 million in taxes by misclassifying some car component imports, but the company is contesting the charge privately with officials, Reuters reported on Wednesday.</p><p>At the heart of the dispute lie Kia&#39;s imports of parts of a car in separate shipments to assemble the vehicles in India, paying a lower tax applicable, circumventing the higher tax outgo when parts come together as a CKD, or a completely knocked down unit, of a car.</p><p>VOLKSWAGEN</p><p>In a similar case as Kia, Volkswagen has sued Indian authorities in a Mumbai court after being slapped with a $1.4 billion tax notice for importing parts related to its 14 models, including some Audi ones, instead of classifying them as CKD.</p><p>The German automaker&#39;s court challenge states that India&#39;s &quot;impossibly enormous&quot; tax demand will hit its investment in the country, and foreign investor sentiment.</p><p>VODAFONE</p><p>In one of the most controversial cases, Vodafone was slapped with a $2 billion tax demand when it purchased Indian assets of Hutchison Whampoa in an $11 billion deal in 2007.</p><p>The dispute saw years-long litigation including a ruling in company&#39;s favour by India&#39;s top court, followed by a change of law which reimposed the demand and an international arbitration between the two sides. Vodafone won the arbitration case in 2020.</p><p>CAIRN ENERGY</p><p>Britain&#39;s Cairn Energy faced a more than $1.4 billion tax demand over the transfer of shares during an internal reorganization in 2007.</p><p>In 2011, Cairn Energy sold its majority stake in Cairn India to Vedanta Ltd, reducing its share in the Indian company to about 10%.</p><p>The Indian administration and Cairn India finally settled the years-long dispute in 2021 by offering to refund the tax amount.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>PERNOD RICARD</p><p>French liquor giant Pernod Ricard has been accused by Indian authorities of undervaluing certain imports for more than a decade to avoid full payment of duties.</p><p>India is demanding roughly $250 million in back taxes but the maker of Chivas Regal and Absolut vodka has contested the findings. The dispute is pending.</p><p>In 2022, Pernod warned Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#39;s administration that its long-running tax disputes with authorities on valuing liquor imports has inhibited fresh investment and its current business.</p><p>BYD</p><p>Chinese automaker BYD has been accused by Indian authorities of underpaying $8.37 million on parts for cars it assembles and sells in India.</p><p>BYD later deposited the demand but the probe is still ongoing and could lead to additional tax charges and penalties, Reuters has previously reported.</p><p>(Reporting by Arpan Chaturvedi; Editing by Aditya Kalra)</p></div></article></div>",
