engineer Linwei Ding of stealing artificial intelligence trade secrets to benefit two Chinese companies he was secretly working for.</p><p>Ding, 38, a Chinese national, was charged by a federal grand jury in San Francisco with seven counts each of economic espionage and theft of trade secrets.</p><p>Each economic espionage charge carries a maximum 15-year prison term and $5 million fine, while each trade secrets charge carries a maximum 10-year term and $250,000 fine.</p><p>The defendant, also known as Leon Ding, was indicted last March on four counts of theft of trade secrets. He is free on bond. Lawyers for Ding did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Ding&#39;s case was coordinated through an interagency Disruptive Technology Strike Force created in 2023 by the Biden administration.</p><p>The initiative was designed to help stop advanced technology from being acquired by countries such as China and Russia, or potentially threatening national security.</p><p>Prosecutors said Ding stole information about the hardware infrastructure and software platform that lets Google&#39;s supercomputing data centers train large AI models.</p><p>Some of the allegedly stolen chip blueprints were meant to give Google an edge over cloud computing rivals Amazon.com and Microsoft, which design their own, and reduce Google&#39;s reliance on chips from Nvidia.</p><p>Prosecutors said Ding joined Google in May 2019 and began his thefts three years later, when he was being courted to join an early-stage Chinese technology company.</p><p>Ding allegedly uploaded more than 1,000 confidential files by May 2023 and later circulated a PowerPoint presentation to employees of a China startup he founded, saying that country&#39;s policies encouraged development of a domestic AI industry.</p><p>Google was not charged and has said it cooperated with law enforcement.</p><p>According to court records describing a Dec. 18 hearing, prosecutors and defense lawyers discussed a &quot;potential resolution&quot; to Ding&#39;s case, &quot;but anticipate the matter proceeding to trial.&quot;</p><p>The case is U.S. v. Ding, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 24-cr-00141.</p><p>(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)</p></div></article></div>",

around mothers who use cannabis was beginning to dissolve.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>To my dismay, however, the images of this cannabis-based alternative parenting lifestyle did not include anyone who looked like me. Of course, it was suddenly OK (and even liberating) to consume weed as a mom — as long </span><a href=\"https://hightimes.com/culture/the-unbearable-whiteness-of-the-marijuana-moms/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:as you’re white;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>as you’re white</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>It appears that the </span><a href=\"https://graphics.aclu.org/marijuana-arrest-report/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:racial stigma of cannabis use;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>racial stigma of cannabis use</span></a><span> permeates every single social demographic. To disrupt that as best as I could, I created Blunt Blowin’ Mama, an online cannabis lifestyle community that aims to normalize conversations around weed use by Black and brown mothers while highlighting the BIWOC impacting change.</span><span>I have spoken to hundreds of women since launching the platform, and they’ve collectively imparted one major takeaway: Moms who use cannabis do so because they believe it makes them better humans and better parents. And Black women deserve that option, too.</span></p><p><span>While there’s a growing discourse amongst new mothers (</span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science/23732852/weed-pregnancy-prenatal-marijuana-cannabis-safety-state-policies\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:and everyone else;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>and everyone else</span></a><span>) about consuming cannabis during pregnancy, most medical experts do not recommend it. Many Black moms, such as myself, are focused instead on the potential postpartum benefits. This is a gray area I had to explore by speaking with mothers from my community about their experiences with cannabis, as well as experts (of all races) about the plant’s effects — and racial bias within the medical system.</span></p><p><span>The most salient concern about women who use weed after they’ve given birth is the chance of harming the baby through breast milk. And researchers are just now starting to examine that “chance.” As of now, there isn’t enough data to certainly predict, for example, when it would be safe to breastfeed again after smoking, vaping, or ingesting cannabis, says </span><a href=\"https://nayacare.org/about-nayacare/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Dr. Sonal Patel;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>Dr. Sonal Patel</span></a><span>, a Denver-based pediatrician and postpartum maternal health care specialist at NayaCare Clinic.</span></p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p><span>While she advises that “cannabis should be avoided after birth and as long as you are planning to breastfeed,” Patel encourages mamas to have an open dialogue with their physician about the subject of weed use. And if a parent feels their care provider is judging them regarding cannabis, they should swiftly find another.</span></p><p><span>The lack of empirical data on postpartum weed use was the overarching concern of all the experts I spoke to (think about how challenging, ethically, it is to launch medical studies on cannabis and breastfeeding). “There is very limited research about cannabis while breastfeeding. Because we don’t know the long-term effects on birthing people and their infants, I agree with major organizations such as ACOG, CDC, and AAP who recommend against the use of marijuana if breastfeeding,” says </span><a href=\"https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/profile/elizabeth-wetterer\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Dr. Libby Wetterer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>Dr. Libby Wetterer</span></a><span>, assistant professor and fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health at UPenn’s Health System.</span></p><p><span>As the CDC reminds us, the data on how cannabis can affect a child through breast milk is both </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/vaccinations-medications-drugs/marijuana.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:under-researched and conflicting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>under-researched and conflicting</span></a><span> —&nbsp;therefore, seen as a sizable risk. “It’s difficult to assess the harms of using cannabis while breastfeeding because most patients that use cannabis while breastfeeding also used it during pregnancy,” says </span><a href=\"https://victoryrejuvenationcenter.com/dr-genester-wilson-king/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Dr. Genester Wilson-King;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>Dr. Genester Wilson-King</span></a><span>, a Florida-based integrated health doctor, OB-GYN, and cannabis educator. “THC and the other cannabinoids in their active form are lipophilic, meaning they like fat, and breast milk is very fatty, so it accumulates in the breast milk.

Cannabis became an incredibly helpful mental health tool for me. On the nights when I actually found sleep (my insomnia was raging), I slept with a kitchen knife in the second drawer of my nightstand in case I decided life was too much.</span></p><p><span>I had trouble shedding over 30 pounds of pregnancy weight during this time.

As a new mom, she could feel those old symptoms of anxiety creeping back in and decided to use cannabis to treat them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Thompson says she consumed cannabis after delivering her baby to feel like herself again, so she took a 5-milligram edible (a relatively low dose) at home while her partner was there to support her. Her intention was simple: relieve the stress of trying to pump additional breast milk as a breastfeeding mama healing from a C-section.</span></p><p><span>While many of us are thirsty for more information on both the positive and negative effects of cannabis on our mental health, researchers are still scratching the surface. </span></p><p><span>While so many cannabis users discuss how weed has alleviated their anxiety and depression, some research, explained </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/30/health/marijuana-pros-and-cons-wellness/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:in a CNN piece;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>in a CNN piece</span></a><span>, has found that weed use can raise the risk “of an onset of a psychotic or mental health disorder, and using it after the onset of a mental condition worsened clinical outcomes.” It’s important for all of us to be aware of the spectrum of potential any drug has on our minds.

If people just took the time to listen to them speak about why they decided to consume, maybe they would learn a thing or two.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Ash, who delivered her baby at a birthing center with only the aid of midwives, successfully used weed for pain management during labor. She consumed cannabis again for her anxiety only a few short hours after giving birth. Ash tells me that today, cannabis helps her be an active mom who taps into her inner child so she can “be silly” with her baby.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Black moms exist at a unique intersection of race, gender and motherhood ― and many are discovering that cannabis can help them thrive and be present for motherhood’s precious moments while avoiding the harmful Black-mom stereotypes of being the loud and aggressive disciplinarian.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So what does a future look like where Black birthing people are respected, and perhaps begin their motherhood journey feeling supported and strong?</span></p><p><span>“It’s important for health care professionals to place value on whole person-centered care,” </span><a href=\"https://pacificcollege.edu/about/faculty/sandra-guynes\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Sandra Guynes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>Sandra Guynes</span></a><span>, a San Diego-based RN and cannabis educator, tells me. “Treating each person as an individual helps us identify any concerns before it’s too late [and] not allowing our biases to cloud our ability to provide personalized care that takes into consideration potential risks for sensitive populations.” </span></p><p><span>While physicians checking their biases and becoming more informed helps Black women feel more comfortable in medical environments, there’s still the issue of the legality of weed in the U.S.</span></p><p><span>Black people are disproportionately arrested for cannabis offenses (nearly four times more than white people) despite Black and white people consuming cannabis at “</span><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/gallery/marijuana-arrests-numbers\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:roughly equal rates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>roughly equal rates</span></a><span>.” The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) also found in a 2020 report that “in every state and in over 95% of counties with more than 30,000 people in which at least 1% of the residents are Black, Black people are arrested at higher rates than white people for marijuana possession.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Despite cannabis being legal for recreational adult use in 24 states and </span><a href=\"https://disa.com/marijuana-legality-by-state\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:decriminalized in 32 states;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>decriminalized in 32 states</span></a><span>, the national trends in racial disparities among </span><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/report/tale-two-countries-racially-targeted-arrests-era-marijuana-reform\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:weed possession arrests;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>weed possession arrests</span></a><span> have remained unchanged since 2010. That disparity is glaring among Black women cannabis users; think about how </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/gender-identity/shacarri-richardsons-cannabis-suspension-is-emblematic-of-a-larger-issue-black-women-in-the-industry-say/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:(the childless) Sha’carri Richardson;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>(the childless) Sha’carri Richardson</span></a><span> was treated when her weed use went public.</span></p><p><span>All the women in this story expressed concern about the repercussions they could face because they’re Black moms who smoke weed. </span></p><p><span>“</span><span>Cannabis may show up in the urine drug screen of a breastfed infant,” Wetterer explains. Black and brown parents have been historically unfairly targeted via the so-called war on drugs and, therefore, “are more likely to be tested for drug use, problematically sometimes without patient consent, and also more likely to have their children taken away if they are reported to the family regulation system commonly known as Children Protective Services.”</span></p><p><span>Wetterer criticizes this </span><span>protocol. “I do not think that anyone should be surveilled or criminalized or have their parenting drawn into question if they do decide to use cannabis.”</span></p><p><span>Black moms are also confronted by a deeply-rooted stigma against cannabis in their own communities. Systemic racism has broken down so many Black families by jailing parents for charges linked to weed that the fear of prison or loss of employment made weed a common enemy. But hopefully, the tide continues to shift.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Today, it’s evident from the incredible women in my community that Black moms understand that cannabis use is their right —&nbsp;and that the racist connotations assigned to certain drugs need to be dismantled. If the medical community begins to see cannabis as another drug that we should approach with hope and caution, we may be able to get far more use out of it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“It’s OK for moms to romanticize having a glass of wine at the end of the day, but for some reason, people think moms who consume cannabis are hotboxing their homes while rocking the baby to sleep,” King says. “There are so many ways to consume cannabis responsibly and still show up as a great parent.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Our children’s health is always paramount — and that’s a fact. But it’s become overwhelmingly evident, through my conversations with Black birthing cannabis enthusiasts, that showing up as a great parent every day means being your most authentic self. That requires remembering who you were before the baby was born and keeping that person alive, too. We can’t pour from an empty vessel, after all. And sometimes, to keep our vessel full, it needs the support of a one-hitter packed with ganja.</span></p><p><em>If you or someone you know needs help, call or text 988 or chat&nbsp;<a href=\"https://988lifeline.org/chat/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:988lifeline.org;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">988lifeline.org</a>&nbsp;for mental health support.

according to a stark new analysis published by leading scientists.</p><p>Led by renowned climatologist James Hansen, the paper appears in the journal &quot;Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development&quot; and concludes that Earth&#39;s climate is more sensitive to rising greenhouse gas emissions than previously thought.</p><p>Compounding the crisis, Hansen and colleagues argued, is a recent decline in sunlight-blocking aerosol pollution from the shipping industry, which had been mitigating some of the warming.</p><p>An ambitious climate change scenario outlined by the UN&#39;s climate panel, which gives the planet a 50 percent chance of keeping warming under 2C by the year 2100, &quot;is an implausible scenario,&quot; Hansen told a briefing Tuesday.</p><p>&quot;That scenario is now impossible,&quot; said Hansen, formerly a top NASA climate scientist who famously announced to the US Congress in 1988 that global warming was underway.</p><p>&quot;The two degree target is dead.&quot;</p><p>Instead, he and co-authors argued, the amount of greenhouse gases already pumped into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels meant increased warming is now guaranteed.</p><p>Temperatures will stay at or above 1.5C in the coming years -- devastating coral reefs and fueling more intense storms -- before rising to around 2.0C by 2045, they forecast.</p><p>They estimated polar ice melt and freshwater injection into the North Atlantic will trigger the shutdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) within the next 20–30 years.</p><p>The current brings warmth to various parts of the globe and also carries nutrients necessary to sustain ocean life.</p><p>Its end &quot;will lock in major problems including sea level rise of several meters -- thus, we describe AMOC shutdown as the &#39;point of no return,&#39;&quot; the paper argued.</p><p>The world&#39;s nations agreed during the landmark Paris climate

nearly every Republican has backed down and embraced all of the president’s picks for powerful Cabinet posts, including Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p><p>Trump is now set to continue efforts to dismantle parts of the federal government with a full complement of top aides, working in tandem with billionaire Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Musk’s team has moved to unilaterally gut federal agencies and freeze spending approved by Congress, over the objections of Democrats and legal experts, who warn it could be unconstitutional.</p><p>“The senate of America seems a lot like the Senate of late Rome. They exist to do the bidding of the emperor,” former Illinois GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a prominent Trump critic, wrote in a <a href=\"https://x.com/AdamKinzinger/status/1886812539637416338\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">post</a> online on Tuesday.</p><h2><strong>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</strong></h2><p>Kennedy has drawn strong opposition from Democrats and outside groups over his long history of peddling anti-vaccine misinformation, including the falsehood that vaccines cause autism. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who is a physician and the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, initially appeared to have grave doubts about Kennedy’s belief in settled science.</p><p>“I’ve been struggling with your nomination,” Cassidy admitted to Kennedy last month, when he testified before the health panel.</p><p>“As someone who has discussed immunizations with thousands of people, I understand that mothers want reassurance that the vaccine their child is receiving is necessary, safe and effective,” said the Louisiana senator. “I’ve approached it using the preponderance of evidence to reassure, and you’ve approached it using selective evidence to cast doubt.”</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Fast forward to Tuesday, and moments before the Senate Finance Committee voted to advance Kennedy to the Senate floor for his confirmation vote, Cassidy — also a member of this committee — <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rfk-senate-committee-hhs_n_67a22b5ae4b0cf0f0a35f28a?ndk\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:voted to back his nomination;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">voted to back his nomination</a>. He explained that he changed his mind because Kennedy promised to “meet or speak multiple times a month” about what he’s working on and receive input on his hiring decisions at the department.</p><p>“Mr. Kennedy and the administration reached out, seeking to reassure me regarding their commitment to protecting the public health benefit of vaccination,” Cassidy said. “To this end, Mr. Kennedy and the administration committed that he and I would have an unprecedentedly close, collaborative working relationship if he is confirmed. ... This collaboration will allow us to work well together and therefore to be more effective.”</p><p>Kennedy said that the partnership “will allow us to represent all sides” of vaccine safety in government.</p><p>Cassidy’s decision to support Kennedy was worrisome even to some conservative observers, as they feared he had dropped his legitimate concerns about the nominee in order to get in line with his party behind Trump. The Louisiana Republican is up for reelection in 2026 and has already drawn a GOP primary challenger, who is likely to remind voters about Cassidy’s vote to convict Trump in his 2021 Senate impeachment trial following the Jan. 6 insurrection.</p><p>“Cassidy’s vote is the single most disappointing, and frightening, occurrence yet in the series of abject surrenders to Trump,” Quin Hillyer, a longtime conservative columnist based in Alabama, <a href=\"https://x.com/quinhillyer/status/1886824479738724394?s=46&amp;t=baBBhbs8HKxS8e5N8kXp1g\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:wrote on social media;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">wrote on social media</a>. “It says there remains NO check in Congress, NONE, against Trump’s outrages, constitutional abuses, and seizures of unwarranted power.”</p><h2><strong>Tulsi Gabbard</strong></h2><p>Gabbard, a lieutenant colonel in the National Guard and former Democratic member of Congress who switched parties last year, had been viewed as the Trump nominee with one of the hardest paths to confirmation. Numerous Senate Republicans expressed concerns with her qualifications to be director of national intelligence, her commitment to top secret intelligence programs, her 2017 meeting with former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and her past statements echoing Moscow’s talking points about Russia’s war on Ukraine.</p><p>Frustration with Gabbard <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tulsi-gabbard-donald-trump-snowden_n_679bd0bae4b0e1faebeee9c7\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:boiled over;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">boiled over </a>during her committee hearing last week, with multiple GOP senators urging her to condemn Edward Snowden, who leaked information on classified intelligence programs in 2013. In Congress, Gabbard had called Snowden “brave” and proposed calling for charges to be dropped against him. She refused to disavow her past support for Snowden and call him a “traitor,” as several Republican senators demanded.</p><p>“It would befit you and be helpful to the way you are perceived to the members of the Intelligence Committee if you at least acknowledge that the greatest whistleblower in American security, so-called, harmed national security,” Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) told Gabbard.</p><p>On Monday, however, Gabbard’s nomination got a major boost after Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a GOP swing vote, announced she would support her confirmation. The Republican senator said Gabbard had addressed her concerns about Snowden and promised not to endorse a potential presidential pardon for him.</p><p>With Collins squarely in the yes column, all eyes turned to Young, a Marine and former intelligence officer with hawkish views who had been critical of Trump in the past. The Indiana Republican announced his support for Gabbard on Tuesday shortly before her nomination advanced in the Senate Intelligence Committee after speaking with Trump and billionaire Elon Musk. The Tesla CEO and Trump ally accused Young of being a “<a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-called-todd-young-223044360.html\" data-ylk=\"slk:deep state puppet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link\">deep state puppet</a>” over the weekend, but Musk <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-called-todd-young-223044360.html\" data-ylk=\"slk:recanted;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link\">recanted</a> shortly after Young got on the phone with him.</p><p>Young said he was satisfied with commitments Gabbard had made to him to hold any leakers of intelligence information accountable and to not recommend any pardon for Snowden.</p><p>“I have done what the Framers envisioned for senators to do: use the consultative process to seek firm commitments, in this case commitments that will advance our national security, which is my top priority as a former Marine Corps intelligence officer,” Young said Tuesday.</p><p>Unlike Cassidy, Young does not face reelection until 2028, theoretically giving him a degree of political insulation in the Senate. Still, the prospect of singlehandedly taking down a Trump nominee would have risked even greater anger from Trump’s allies, even though the president reportedly told Young to “<a href=\"https://x.com/mkraju/status/1886864354064130327\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:vote your conscience;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">vote your conscience</a>.”</p><h2><strong>Pete Hegseth</strong></h2><p>Last month, the Senate confirmed Hegseth as Trump’s defense secretary after weeks of debate about his slim qualifications and his alleged history of excessive drinking and domestic abuse. Three GOP senators — Collins, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky — stood in opposition, but Vice President JD Vance broke the 50-50 tie and his nomination was confirmed.</p><p>New reporting from <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/pete-hegseth-thom-tillis-senate-confirmation-1974dd47?st=eeDK69&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:The Wall Street Journal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">The Wall Street Journal</a> on Monday, however, revealed that another GOP senator — Thom Tillis of North Carolina — had been prepared to vote against Hegseth because of the abuse allegations, and had informed the White House of his intention to do so. Tillis backed down <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/pete-hegseth-thom-tillis-senate-confirmation-1974dd47?st=eeDK69&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:hours before the vote;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">hours before the vote</a>, however, after GOP leaders told him they would not cancel it, making clear he’d have to endure backlash from Trump’s MAGA allies if he voted Hegseth down.</p><p>“Anytime you have an allegation and somebody is willing to put it in sworn testimony, you owe it to the process to review it and not just dispose it out of hand,” Tills told<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senator-tillis-opens-up-about-role-pete-hegseths-confirmation-after-ex-sister-in-law-allegations\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Fox News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"> Fox News</a> about conversations with Hegseth’s accusers. “And that’s exactly what I did. And then I arrived at the conclusion that I’d support Pete’s nomination.”</p><p>Tillis is also up for reelection in 2026 and is likely to face several GOP primary challengers. In 2023, the North Carolina state Republican Party <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/06/11/1181549031/thom-tillis-north-carolina-censure-lgbtq-rights-gun-control-immigration\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:censured;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">censured</a> Tillis for backing LGBTQ+ rights, immigration and gun violence policies in Congress.</p><p>Some Democrats said they were surprised to see their Republican colleagues fold so quickly on Trump’s most problematic Cabinet picks.</p><p>“There are so many reasons that they should be defeated by their own statements, both past and recent,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said of the nominees.</p><p>Of his colleagues, Blumenthal added, “Anyone voting for these nominees will be haunted by those decisions when they do bad things.”</p><p>Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) also expressed disappointment in Republican senators, who he said are “maybe secretly whispering” to Democrats about their concerns with certain Trump nominees but will then turn around and vote for them on the Senate floor.</p><p>“At some point, people are going to have to stand up and say, this is not what we meant,” Schatz said in a speech on the Senate floor.</p><h3>Related...</h3><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/times-tulsi-gabbard-congress-now-deposed-syria-bashar-assad_n_675c8ab8e4b08821cba7819a\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:7 Times Tulsi Gabbard Went To Bat In Congress For Now-Deposed Syrian Dictator Bashar Assad;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">7 Times Tulsi Gabbard Went To Bat In Congress For Now-Deposed Syrian Dictator Bashar Assad</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-vaccines-kennedy-autism-conspiracy_n_67a227ffe4b09c9485622a52\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Trump Appears To Support Vaccine Conspiracy Theory In Pro-RFK Jr. Post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Trump Appears To Support Vaccine Conspiracy Theory In Pro-RFK Jr. Post</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rfk-jr-abortion-medication-fda_n_67a1373ae4b06678d2a183ba\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Why RFK Jr.&#39;s Promise On Medication Abortion Matters More Than You Think;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Why RFK Jr.&#39;s Promise On Medication Abortion Matters More Than You Think</a></p></li></ul></div></article></div>",
