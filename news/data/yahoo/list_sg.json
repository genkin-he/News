sparking fears of another debilitating trade war between the economic superpowers.</p><p>Shanghai, which reopened after a week-long break, and Hong Kong were among the main losers as e-commerce firms took a hit from news that the US Postal Service was suspending inbound parcels from China and Hong Kong.</p><p>The tepid performance came despite a positive lead from Wall Street, where there was a sigh of relief that US President Donald Trump had reached a deal to delay 25 percent duties on imports from Canada and Mexico.</p><p>Disappointing earnings from Google-parent Alphabet and Advanced Micro Devices added to the unease over the tech sector, which has already been roiled by the unveiling of a new chatbot by Chinese startup DeepSeek.</p><p>All eyes were on Washington and Beijing after they renewed their trade spat, though analysts said China&#39;s apparently more measured approach provided some hope that a full-blown crisis could be avoided.</p><p>&quot;Regarding China&#39;s counter measures, we think that the tariffs are less than what we had expected in our view. The move is largely symbolic given that only about 12% of total imports from the US would be subject to tariffs,&quot; said Kai Wang, Asia equity market strategist at Morningstar.</p><p>&quot;A key takeaway from this development, at least for now, is that fundamentally there is less risk implied than expected before.</p><p>&quot;However, escalation of the trade war remains a risk given Trump&#39;s history of unpredictable behaviour. Therefore, the volatility risk remains on the table for the next four years at least,&quot; Wang added.</p><p>Economists at HSBC Global Research added that China&#39;s &quot;moves so far are more measured compared with the universal 10 percent tariff imposed by the US, suggesting a likely different playbook than a tit-for-tat strategy, though we acknowledge the risk of escalation has increased&quot;.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Hong Kong fell 1.2 percent, with e-commerce giant JD.com sinking more than four percent and rival Alibaba losing more than one percent on news of the US Postal Service suspension.</p><p>Trump&#39;s tariff announcement against China included the removal of an allowance -- used by China&#39;s e-commerce firms -- that exempted small packages worth less than $800 from duties.</p><p>The suspension does not involve letters and flat mail.</p><p>There were also losses in Tokyo, Singapore, Wellington and Jakarta, though Sydney, Seoul, Taipei and Manila rose.</p><p>Gold hit a fresh peak of $2,853.82 as investors rushed into the safe-haven metal.</p><p>Tech firms were again under pressure after Alphabet sank 7.5 percent in after-hours trade in New York owing to disappointment at its lower-than-expected revenue growth and its ambitious 2025 capital spending forecast.</p><p>Advanced Micro Devices also sank in post-close business.</p><p>The tech sector has been feeling some pain since DeepSeek&#39;s arrival on the scene with its chatbot, which apparently was developed at a fraction of the cost of similar tools made by US firms, stoking concerns about the eye-watering investments made in AI in recent years.</p><p>On currency markets, the yen strengthened against the dollar following data showing nominal wages in Japan rose far more than expected last month and at the fastest pace since 1997.</p><p>That firmed expectations the country&#39;s central bank would continue to hike interest rates this year.</p><p>- Key figures around 0230 GMT -</p><p>Tokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 0.2 percent to 38,727.19 (break)</p><p>Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: DOWN 1.0 percent to 20,574.20</p><p>Shanghai - Composite: DOWN 0.5 percent to 3,236.09</p><p>Euro/dollar: DOWN at $1.0378 from $1.0383&nbsp;on Tuesday</p><p>Pound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2477 from $1.2480</p><p>Dollar/yen: DOWN at 153.66 yen from 154.32 yen</p><p>Euro/pound: UP at 83.17 pence from 83.16 pence</p><p>West Texas Intermediate: UP 0.2 percent at $72.82 per barrel</p><p>Brent North Sea Crude: FLAT at $76.22 per barrel</p><p>New York - Dow: UP 0.3&nbsp;percent at 44,556.04 (close)</p><p>London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.2 percent at 8,570.77&nbsp;(close)</p><p>dan/sco</p></div></article></div>",

We&#39;ll own it,&quot; Trump said.</p><p>He said there was support from the &quot;highest leadership&quot; in the Middle East and upped pressure on Egypt and Jordan to take displaced Gazans -- despite both countries and the Palestinians flatly rejecting the surprise idea.</p><p>Suggesting &quot;long-term ownership&quot; by the United States, Trump said his plan for Gaza would make it &quot;the Riviera of the Middle East. This could be something that could be so magnificent.&quot;</p><p>Key US ally Netanyahu said Trump&#39;s plan could &quot;change history&quot; and was worth &quot;paying attention to.&quot;</p><p>Netanyahu was making the first visit of a foreign leader to the White House since Trump&#39;s return to power, for what were billed as talks on securing a second phase of the Israel-Hamas truce after an initial six-week ceasefire.</p><p>- &#39;Miserable existence&#39; -</p><p>But it quickly turned into the shock revelation of a plan that would completely transform the face of the Middle East.</p><p>Trump, who also floated traveling to Gaza, appeared to suggest it would not be rebuilt for Palestinians.</p><p>&quot;It should not go through a process of rebuilding and occupation by the same people that have... lived there and died there and lived a miserable existence there,&quot; he said.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The Palestinian envoy to the UN had pushed back strongly at Trump&#39;s suggestions earlier Tuesday -- before his proposal the United States take the territory over -- for his people to be resettled.</p><p>&quot;Our homeland is our homeland,&quot; said Riyad Mansour.</p><p>&quot;And I think that leaders and people should respect the wishes of the Palestinian people.&quot;</p><p>Gazans have also denounced Trump&#39;s resettlement idea. &quot;Trump thinks Gaza is a pile of garbage -- absolutely not,&quot; said 34-year-old Hatem Azzam, a resident of the southern city of Rafah.</p><p>Trump was vague on the details of how he would execute the takeover plan, but hinted that it could require US boots on the ground in one of the most volatile places on earth &quot;if necessary.&quot;</p><p>It is not the first time the former property tycoon has spoken about the Palestinian territory in terms of real estate, saying in October it could be &quot;better than Monaco.&quot;</p><p>Standing at a podium beside Trump, Netanyahu hailed Trump as Israel&#39;s &quot;greatest friend&quot; and praised his &quot;willingness to think outside the box.&quot;</p><p>The two have had tense relations in the past, but Netanyahu has seized on the Republican&#39;s return to power after his ties with former president Joe Biden became increasingly strained over the death toll in Gaza since Israel&#39;s invasion.</p><p>- &#39;Winning the war&#39; -</p><p>The Israeli leader would not rule out a return to hostilities with Hamas, or with its other foes in the region including Lebanon&#39;s Hezbollah and Iran.</p><p>&quot;We will end the war by winning the war,&quot; Netanyahu insisted, while also vowing to secure the return of all hostages held by Hamas.</p><p>He did voice confidence that a deal with regional rival Saudi Arabia to normalize relations was &quot;going to happen.&quot;</p><p>But after Trump aired his proposal, Saudi Arabia said it would not formalize ties with Israel unless a Palestinian state is established.</p><p>Trump&#39;s grand Gaza plan however is set to face harsh opposition from Palestinians and Middle Eastern countries.</p><p>Egypt, Jordan and ceasefire mediator Qatar have all flatly rejected Trump&#39;s suggestion of moving Palestinians from Gaza.</p><p>The war began when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, taking into Gaza 251 hostages, 76 of whom are still held in the Palestinian territory including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.</p><p>Hamas&#39;s attack resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people on Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p><p>Israel&#39;s retaliatory response has killed at least 47,518 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory&#39;s health ministry.

Vora</p><p>MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Indian rupee is likely to decline at open on Wednesday weighed by the currency&#39;s weakness in the non-deliverable forward markets, while being unable to take advantage of the further decline in the dollar index.</p><p>The 1-month non-deliverable forward indicated that the rupee will open at 87.14-87.16 to the U.S. dollar compared with 87.0675 in the previous session.</p><p>There &quot;does not seem to be a specific reason&quot; for (dollar/rupee) NDF to be higher, a currency trader at a bank said.</p><p>&quot;If I had to provide a reason, it&#39;s the overall direction, which is higher (on dollar rupee),&quot; the trader said.</p><p>The rupee on Tuesday was in the 87.01-87.14 range, having to contend with the news flow on tariffs. The rally to near 87 brought about by the U.S. delaying tariffs on Canada and Mexico was cut short by China&#39;s retaliation to U.S. tariffs, to which the initial reaction of investors was to sell the Chinese yuan and avoid risk assets.</p><p>That initial reaction faded, helping the rupee recover from the lows of Tuesday&#39;s session.</p><p>All eyes on Wednesday were on China with markets resuming trade after the Lunar New Year break. The People&#39;s Bank of China set a higher-than-expected yuan mid-point.</p><p>The onshore yuan was at 7.2832 to the U.S. dollar. Its offshore counterpart has declined past 7.36 on Tuesday.</p><p>DOLLAR FALLS FURTHER</p><p>The dollar index slipped below the 108 handle after rallying to near 110 on worries over U.S. tariffs on its trading partners. U.S. suspending tariffs on Mexico and Canada interrupted the upward march on the dollar.</p><p>&quot;With tariff news flow cooling off for now and no imminent deadlines, the focus will shift back towards the U.S. labour market,&quot; DBS Bank said in a note.</p><p>Data released on Tuesday showed U.S. job openings fell by the most in 14 months.

Prime Minister Francois Bayrou is expected on Wednesday to survive a no-confidence vote in parliament, winning some breathing space after less than two months in office but by no means ensuring his long-term future.</p><p>Bayrou, a veteran centrist named by President Emmanuel Macron in December to end months of political crisis, on Monday used a controversial constitutional article to ram his cost-cutting budget through parliament without a vote.</p><p>But the use of this mechanism, article 49.3, allows the opposition to put forward a no-confidence motion and the bid to topple the government was duly proposed by the hard-left France Unbowed, backed by the Communists and the Greens, to be voted on Wednesday.</p><p>But while Bayrou is nowhere near having a majority in the National Assembly, the Socialists and far-right National Rally (RN) both said they would not back the no-confidence motion.</p><p>This gives Bayrou the numbers to survive and see through the budget. But it is unlikely to be the only challenge to his shaky administration in the coming months.</p><p>Bayrou, a keen historian who has written a book on his hero French king Henri IV assassinated in Paris in 1610, is well versed in how political ambition can suddenly come to an end.</p><p>&quot;Passive support from both the Socialists and Marine Le Pen&#39;s far-right for Bayrou will end once a 2025 budget is fully enacted in the next few days,&quot; risk analysis firm Eurasia Group said, giving a 70-percent chance that the government will &quot;fall in the next few months&quot;.</p><p>- &#39;Give France a budget&#39; -</p><p>Jordan Bardella, RN leader, said his party did not intend to back the no-confidence vote adding while &quot;it&#39;s a bad budget... we need a budget&quot;.</p><p>&quot;We need to avoid uncertainty because many of our fellow citizens... are extremely worried about possible long-term instability,&quot; he said.</p><p>Socialist leader Olivier Faure said his party decided against voting to topple the government over the budget, as it would only have resulted in France having &quot;a prime minister further to the right&quot;, or even &quot;the resignation of a head of state&quot;.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;We chose to give France a budget,&quot; he told the France Inter radio station.</p><p>The move by the Socialists is a major boost for Bayrou that could mark the end of a broad left-wing alliance including the Socialists and LFI party that had endured since the election campaign.</p><p>But in a symbolic move, the party leadership decided Monday to propose a separate no-confidence motion after Bayrou referred to migrants &quot;flooding&quot; France, using terminology previously used by the far right.</p><p>However, this has little chance of passing as it is expected to be rejected by all right-wing parties.</p><p>Bayrou&#39;s predecessor Michel Barnier was toppled in a no-confidence vote late last year, leaving France in uncharted political waters.</p><p>- &#39;Need stability&#39; -</p><p>The survival of Bayrou&#39;s government will be a relief for Macron who has faced calls to resign since the middle of last year but insisted he will stay on until the end of his term, due to end in 2027.</p><p>Many analysts and even allies are still baffled by the president&#39;s decision to call snap parliamentary elections last summer which gave the far right its biggest ever foothold in a divided parliament.</p><p>The cost-cutting and tax-hiking budget has proved controversial in some quarters, with France&#39;s richest man, the luxury goods mogul Bernard Arnault, denouncing a planned special corporate tax.</p><p>&quot;We need stability,&quot; Macron said on Tuesday, while adding that &quot;we should not go backwards&quot;.</p><p>Turbulent months remain ahead in French politics.</p><p>A verdict is due in far-right leader Marine Le Pen&#39;s fake EU parliament jobs trial -- on charges she denies -- on March 31 and she could be disqualified from the 2027 elections if convicted in a major political crossroads.</p><p>far-lum-ah-sjw/as/yad/rsc</p></div></article></div>",

with some reports saying the move could spell the end of their merger talks.</p><p>The companies agreed in December to launch discussions on joining forces to create the world&#39;s third largest automaker, seen as a bid to catch up with Tesla and Chinese electric vehicle firms.</p><p>Honda&#39;s CEO insisted at the time it was not a bailout for Nissan, which last year announced thousands of job cuts after reporting a 93 percent plunge in first-half net profit.</p><p>Japanese public broadcaster NHK and other media outlets reported Tuesday that Honda was offering to acquire Nissan shares and make it a subsidiary, instead of the previous plan to integrate under a new holding company.</p><p>But the proposal is expected to face fierce opposition from Nissan over concerns over its autonomy, the reports said.</p><p>Honda shares jumped more than four percent in morning trading on Wednesday. Nissan shares were also up more than four percent.</p><p>A Honda spokeswoman told AFP there had been no official announcement and declined to comment further. Nissan was not immediately available for comment.</p><p>The Asahi newspaper said both companies would soon hold separate board meetings to discuss issues including the possibility of calling off the talks.</p><p>The Yomiuri daily cited an unnamed Nissan executive as saying the merger was now &quot;almost impossible&quot;, with difficulties satisfying shareholders on either side.</p><p>Lacklustre consumer spending and stiff competition in several markets are making life hard for many automakers.</p><p>Business has been especially tough for foreign brands in China, where electric vehicle manufacturers such as BYD are leading the way as demand grows for less polluting vehicles.</p><p>Honda and Nissan are Japan&#39;s number two and three automakers after Toyota.</p><p>They already agreed last year to explore a partnership on EV software and components among other technologies, an initiative joined by Mitsubishi Motors in August.</p><p>But the smaller automaker&#39;s chief said this week that it will make a final decision on whether to join the Honda-Nissan merger talks in mid-February or later.</p><p>kh-kaf/sco</p></div></article></div>",
