and Elizabeth Pineau</p><p>PARIS (Reuters) - All eyes are on the French capital next week to see if U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration can find common ground with China and nearly 100 other nations on the safe development of artificial intelligence.</p><p>About a year after world powers reckoned with the dangers of AI in England’s Bletchley Park, a wider array of countries are gathering in Paris to discuss putting the technology to work.</p><p>France, eager to promote its national industry, is hosting the AI Action Summit alongside India on Feb. 10 and 11, with a focus on areas where Europe’s second-largest economy has an advantage: freely available or “open-source” systems, and clean energy to power data centers.</p><p>Mitigating labor disruption and promoting sovereignty in a global AI market are also on the agenda.</p><p>Top executives from Alphabet, Microsoft and dozens of other businesses are slated to attend. Government leaders are expected to dine on Monday with select CEOs. And talks will include one on Tuesday by Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, two people involved in the summit told Reuters.</p><p>It was less clear whether the U.S. will reach consensus with other nations on AI.</p><p>Since taking office on Jan. 20, President Trump has revoked former President Joe Biden’s 2023 executive order on the technology, set in motion a repeat withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and faced Congressional calls to consider new export controls on AI chips to counter rival China.</p><p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance will attend for the American delegation.</p><p>A non-binding communiqué of principles for the stewardship of AI, bearing U.S., Chinese and other signatures, has been under negotiation and would mark a big achievement if reached, said the people involved in the summit, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p><p>They declined to detail the communiqué or elaborate if there were any points of disagreement among the would-be signatories.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>An official for the French presidency said the summit will give voice to countries around the world, not only the U.S. and China.</p><p>&quot;We are showing that AI is here, that companies must adopt it, that it is a vector of competitiveness for France and for Europe,&quot; the Élysée official said.</p><p>NO NEW AI REGULATION</p><p>Safety commitments dominated the conversation in prior global AI summits in Bletchley Park and Seoul. In Paris, creating new regulation is not on the agenda.</p><p>Reeling from red tape and a reputation for risk aversion, Europe and particularly France are eager to discuss frameworks for AI policy but not rules that could slow down their national champions, which have lagged American companies. Countries like France are evaluating how to implement the EU AI Act in as flexible a way as possible so it does not discourage innovation, the people involved in the summit said.</p><p>Instead in focus is how to distribute AI’s benefits to developing nations, via cheaper models made by the likes of France’s startup Mistral and China’s DeepSeek. The Hangzhou-based company rocked global markets last month by showing it could vie with U.S. heavyweights on human-like reasoning technology, while charging much less.</p><p>France has seized on the development as evidence that the global race to more powerful AI remains wide open.</p><p>One of the summit’s likely outcomes is that philanthropies and businesses are expected to commit an initial $500 million in capital, going up to $2.5 billion over five years, to fund public-interest projects on AI around the world, the people said.</p><p>Another is addressing the energy crunch that industry thinks is inevitable from their power-hungry AI models. A major producer of clean energy in the form of nuclear power, France wants to reconcile the world’s climate and AI ambitions.</p><p>France&#39;s decarbonized energy and &quot;nuclear fleet, in the context of data center installations, is an asset,&quot; the Élysée official said. &quot;We will most likely have announcements in this regard at the summit.&quot;</p><p>(Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin and Elizabeth Pineau; Additional reporting by Nandita Bose and Anna Tong; Editing by David Gregorio)</p></div></article></div>",

submitted for the former democracy leader&#39;s home -- the third time the sale has flopped.</p><p>The two-storey Yangon house, with about 0.8 hectares (1.9 acres) of land, was put up for sale with a minimum price of $140 million following a decades-long dispute over the property between the Nobel laureate and her brother.</p><p>Suu Kyi, who spent years under house arrest at the mansion under a former junta, has been detained since the military seized power once again in February 2021.</p><p>Around a dozen journalists, watched over by security personnel in plain clothes, attended the kerbside sale outside the colonial-era house on leafy University Avenue, a few doors from the US embassy.</p><p>After calling for bids starting from 297 billion kyats -- around $140 million at the official exchange rate -- and getting no response, the auctioneer called off the sale, AFP reporters at the scene saw.</p><p>&quot;I announce the auction is not successful after calling for bids three times,&quot; the auctioneer said.</p><p>Similar auctions failed in March and August last year.</p><p>With Myanmar&#39;s economy shattered by the civil war triggered by the military coup, it is unclear who in the country would be in a position to spend $140 million on a single, increasingly dilapidated property.</p><p>Real estate agents say similar-sized properties in upmarket Yangon areas might fetch $1 million to $2 million.</p><p>The house holds a special place in Myanmar history -- Suu Kyi was confined within its crumbling walls for around 15 years after shooting to fame during huge demonstrations against the then-junta in 1988.</p><p>Cut off from her husband and children in England, Suu Kyi spent time playing the piano, reading detective novels and meditating as her status as a democracy leader grew.</p><p>Hundreds of people would regularly gather on the pavement outside to hear her talk about&nbsp;democracy and fighting military rule through non-violence.</p><div

Kyi, 79, is serving a 27-year prison sentence on charges ranging from corruption to not respecting Covid-19 pandemic restrictions -- charges rights groups say are a junta sham designed to eliminate her politically.</p><p>bur-pdw/mtp</p></div></article></div>",

(-)</figcaption></div></figure><p>US President Donald Trump said Tuesday he was not in a hurry to speak with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, despite expectations that they would hold talks after announcing tit-for-tat tariffs in a growing trade conflict.</p><p>Beijing said it was imposing levies on imports of US energy, vehicles and equipment in a return salvo minutes after Trump&#39;s threatened tariffs on Chinese goods came into effect Tuesday.</p><p>A day prior, Trump suspended duties on Mexico and Canada for a month after both countries vowed to step up measures to counter flows of the drug fentanyl and the crossing of undocumented migrants into the United States.</p><p>Trump had signaled earlier that the talks with Xi could take place early this week, but addressing reporters at the White House Tuesday afternoon, he said he was in &quot;no rush&quot; to talk to Xi.</p><p>US stock markets shrugged off weakness on Tuesday, but Chinese stocks saw volatility after markets opened Wednesday as the US Postal Service said it was suspending inbound package shipments from China and Hong Kong &quot;until further notice.&quot;</p><p>Letters and flats, it said, would not be impacted.</p><p>Trump had imposed fresh 10 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, on top of levies that were already in place against Washington&#39;s biggest economic competitor. Mexico and Canada had faced 25 percent tariffs.</p><p>Trump&#39;s tariff order also eliminated a duty-free exemption for low value packages, a move that could delay packages of Chinese-founded online retailers Shein and Temu from entering the country.</p><p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that Trump was due to talk to Xi, but on Tuesday said she had no &quot;updates on when that call will take place.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He is not going to allow China to continue to source and distribute deadly fentanyl into our country, that was the reason for this tariff,&quot; Leavitt told reporters outside the West Wing of the White House.</p><p>- &#39;Malicious&#39; -</p><p>China unveiled 15 percent levies on imports of coal and liquefied natural gas from the United States, while crude oil, agricultural machinery, big-engined vehicles, and pickup trucks face 10 percent duties.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Beijing says it will also probe US tech giant Google and the US fashion group that owns Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein.</p><p>China&#39;s government said the measures were in response to the &quot;unilateral tariff hike&quot; by Washington. It said it would also file a complaint to the World Trade Organization over the &quot;malicious&quot; levies.</p><p>Additionally, it unveiled fresh export controls on rare metals and chemicals including tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, and molybdenum, used in a range of industrial appliances.</p><p>China is a major market for US energy exports and according to Beijing customs data, imports of oil, coal and LNG totaled more than $7 billion last year.</p><p>But that is dwarfed by China&#39;s imports from more friendly powers such as Russia, from which it purchased $94 billion-worth last year.</p><p>- Last-minute deals -</p><p>Trump has made tariffs a key foreign policy tool of his second term, joking that the word tariff is the &quot;most beautiful&quot; in the dictionary.</p><p>The Republican billionaire said his duties aimed to punish countries for failing to halt flows of illegal migrants and drugs including the powerful opioid fentanyl into the United States.</p><p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau both struck last-minute deals with Trump on Monday to tighten border measures, leading to a 30-day pause on threatened levies.</p><p>Talks will continue for the next month on broader pacts.</p><p>Mexico said Tuesday it had begun the 10,000-strong border troop deployment it had promised Trump as part of the agreement to halt tariffs.</p><p>&quot;The deployment has already started,&quot; Sheinbaum told reporters.</p><p>More than 450,000 people have been murdered countrywide since Mexico launched a major offensive against drug cartels in 2006.</p><p>Trudeau said Canada would appoint a &quot;Fentanyl Czar&quot; and list drug cartels as terrorist organizations.</p><p>burs-dk-bys/jgc</p></div></article></div>",

took a hit from news that the US Postal Service was suspending inbound parcels from China and Hong Kong.</p><p>The tepid performance came despite a positive lead from Wall Street, where there was a sigh of relief that US President Donald Trump had reached a deal to delay 25 percent duties on imports from Canada and Mexico.</p><p>Disappointing earnings from Google-parent Alphabet and Advanced Micro Devices added to the unease over the tech sector, which has already been roiled by the unveiling of a new chatbot by Chinese startup DeepSeek.</p><p>All eyes were on Washington and Beijing after they renewed their trade spat, though analysts said China&#39;s apparently more measured approach provided some hope that a full-blown crisis could be avoided.</p><p>&quot;Regarding China&#39;s counter measures, we think that the tariffs are less than what we had expected in our view. The move is largely symbolic given that only about 12% of total imports from the US would be subject to tariffs,&quot; said Kai Wang, Asia equity market strategist at Morningstar.</p><p>&quot;A key takeaway from this development, at least for now, is that fundamentally there is less risk implied than expected before.</p><p>&quot;However, escalation of the trade war remains a risk given Trump&#39;s history of unpredictable behaviour. Therefore, the volatility risk remains on the table for the next four years at least,&quot; Wang added.</p><p>Economists at HSBC Global Research added that China&#39;s &quot;moves so far are more measured compared with the universal 10 percent tariff imposed by the US, suggesting a likely different playbook than a tit-for-tat strategy, though we acknowledge the risk of escalation has increased&quot;.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Hong Kong fell 1.2 percent, with e-commerce giant JD.com sinking more than four percent and rival Alibaba losing more than one percent on news of the US Postal Service suspension.</p><p>Trump&#39;s tariff announcement against China included the removal of an allowance -- used by China&#39;s e-commerce firms -- that exempted small packages worth less than $800 from duties.</p><p>The suspension does not involve letters and flat mail.</p><p>There were also losses in Tokyo, Singapore, Wellington and Jakarta, though Sydney, Seoul, Taipei and Manila rose.</p><p>Gold hit a fresh peak of $2,853.82 as investors rushed into the safe-haven metal.</p><p>Tech firms were again under pressure after Alphabet sank 7.5 percent in after-hours trade in New York owing to disappointment at its lower-than-expected revenue growth and its ambitious 2025 capital spending forecast.</p><p>Advanced Micro Devices also sank in post-close business.</p><p>The tech sector has been feeling some pain since DeepSeek&#39;s arrival on the scene with its chatbot, which apparently was developed at a fraction of the cost of similar tools made by US firms, stoking concerns about the eye-watering investments made in AI in recent years.</p><p>On currency markets, the yen strengthened against the dollar following data showing nominal wages in Japan rose far more than expected last month and at the fastest pace since 1997.</p><p>That firmed expectations the country&#39;s central bank would continue to hike interest rates this year.</p><p>- Key figures around 0230 GMT -</p><p>Tokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 0.2 percent to 38,727.19 (break)</p><p>Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: DOWN 1.0 percent to 20,574.20</p><p>Shanghai - Composite: DOWN 0.5 percent to 3,236.09</p><p>Euro/dollar: DOWN at $1.0378 from $1.0383&nbsp;on Tuesday</p><p>Pound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2477 from $1.2480</p><p>Dollar/yen: DOWN at 153.66 yen from 154.32 yen</p><p>Euro/pound: UP at 83.17 pence from 83.16 pence</p><p>West Texas Intermediate: UP 0.2 percent at $72.82 per barrel</p><p>Brent North Sea Crude: FLAT at $76.22 per barrel</p><p>New York - Dow: UP 0.3&nbsp;percent at 44,556.04 (close)</p><p>London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.2 percent at 8,570.77&nbsp;(close)</p><p>dan/sco</p></div></article></div>",

We&#39;ll own it,&quot; Trump said.</p><p>He said there was support from the &quot;highest leadership&quot; in the Middle East and upped pressure on Egypt and Jordan to take displaced Gazans -- despite both countries and the Palestinians flatly rejecting the surprise idea.</p><p>Suggesting &quot;long-term ownership&quot; by the United States, Trump said his plan for Gaza would make it &quot;the Riviera of the Middle East. This could be something that could be so magnificent.&quot;</p><p>Key US ally Netanyahu said Trump&#39;s plan could &quot;change history&quot; and was worth &quot;paying attention to.&quot;</p><p>Netanyahu was making the first visit of a foreign leader to the White House since Trump&#39;s return to power, for what were billed as talks on securing a second phase of the Israel-Hamas truce after an initial six-week ceasefire.</p><p>- &#39;Miserable existence&#39; -</p><p>But it quickly turned into the shock revelation of a plan that would completely transform the face of the Middle East.</p><p>Trump, who also floated traveling to Gaza, appeared to suggest it would not be rebuilt for Palestinians.</p><p>&quot;It should not go through a process of rebuilding and occupation by the same people that have... lived there and died there and lived a miserable existence there,&quot; he said.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The Palestinian envoy to the UN had pushed back strongly at Trump&#39;s suggestions earlier Tuesday -- before his proposal the United States take the territory over -- for his people to be resettled.</p><p>&quot;Our homeland is our homeland,&quot; said Riyad Mansour.</p><p>&quot;And I think that leaders and people should respect the wishes of the Palestinian people.&quot;</p><p>Gazans have also denounced Trump&#39;s resettlement idea. &quot;Trump thinks Gaza is a pile of garbage -- absolutely not,&quot; said 34-year-old Hatem Azzam, a resident of the southern city of Rafah.</p><p>Trump was vague on the details of how he would execute the takeover plan, but hinted that it could require US boots on the ground in one of the most volatile places on earth &quot;if necessary.&quot;</p><p>It is not the first time the former property tycoon has spoken about the Palestinian territory in terms of real estate, saying in October it could be &quot;better than Monaco.&quot;</p><p>Standing at a podium beside Trump, Netanyahu hailed Trump as Israel&#39;s &quot;greatest friend&quot; and praised his &quot;willingness to think outside the box.&quot;</p><p>The two have had tense relations in the past, but Netanyahu has seized on the Republican&#39;s return to power after his ties with former president Joe Biden became increasingly strained over the death toll in Gaza since Israel&#39;s invasion.</p><p>- &#39;Winning the war&#39; -</p><p>The Israeli leader would not rule out a return to hostilities with Hamas, or with its other foes in the region including Lebanon&#39;s Hezbollah and Iran.</p><p>&quot;We will end the war by winning the war,&quot; Netanyahu insisted, while also vowing to secure the return of all hostages held by Hamas.</p><p>He did voice confidence that a deal with regional rival Saudi Arabia to normalize relations was &quot;going to happen.&quot;</p><p>But after Trump aired his proposal, Saudi Arabia said it would not formalize ties with Israel unless a Palestinian state is established.</p><p>Trump&#39;s grand Gaza plan however is set to face harsh opposition from Palestinians and Middle Eastern countries.</p><p>Egypt, Jordan and ceasefire mediator Qatar have all flatly rejected Trump&#39;s suggestion of moving Palestinians from Gaza.</p><p>The war began when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, taking into Gaza 251 hostages, 76 of whom are still held in the Palestinian territory including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.</p><p>Hamas&#39;s attack resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people on Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p><p>Israel&#39;s retaliatory response has killed at least 47,518 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory&#39;s health ministry. The UN considers these figures as reliable.</p><p>The truce that took effect on January 18 has&nbsp;led to a surge of food, fuel, medical and other aid into Gaza, and allowed people displaced by the war to return to the north of the Palestinian territory.</p><p>But since the Gaza ceasefire took effect, Israel has launched a deadly operation against militants in the occupied West Bank&#39;s north.</p><p>burs-dk</p></div></article></div>",

Vora</p><p>MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Indian rupee is likely to decline at open on Wednesday weighed by the currency&#39;s weakness in the non-deliverable forward markets, while being unable to take advantage of the further decline in the dollar index.</p><p>The 1-month non-deliverable forward indicated that the rupee will open at 87.14-87.16 to the U.S. dollar compared with 87.0675 in the previous session.</p><p>There &quot;does not seem to be a specific reason&quot; for (dollar/rupee) NDF to be higher, a currency trader at a bank said.</p><p>&quot;If I had to provide a reason, it&#39;s the overall direction, which is higher (on dollar rupee),&quot; the trader said.</p><p>The rupee on Tuesday was in the 87.01-87.14 range, having to contend with the news flow on tariffs. The rally to near 87 brought about by the U.S. delaying tariffs on Canada and Mexico was cut short by China&#39;s retaliation to U.S. tariffs, to which the initial reaction of investors was to sell the Chinese yuan and avoid risk assets.</p><p>That initial reaction faded, helping the rupee recover from the lows of Tuesday&#39;s session.</p><p>All eyes on Wednesday were on China with markets resuming trade after the Lunar New Year break. The People&#39;s Bank of China set a higher-than-expected yuan mid-point.</p><p>The onshore yuan was at 7.2832 to the U.S. dollar. Its offshore counterpart has declined past 7.36 on Tuesday.</p><p>DOLLAR FALLS FURTHER</p><p>The dollar index slipped below the 108 handle after rallying to near 110 on worries over U.S. tariffs on its trading partners. U.S. suspending tariffs on Mexico and Canada interrupted the upward march on the dollar.</p><p>&quot;With tariff news flow cooling off for now and no imminent deadlines, the focus will shift back towards the U.S. labour market,&quot; DBS Bank said in a note.</p><p>Data released on Tuesday showed U.S. job openings fell by the most in 14 months.
