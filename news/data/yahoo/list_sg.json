evening.</p><p>Atlaoui&#39;s lawyer Richard Sedillot said he would work to have his client&#39;s sentence &quot;adapted&quot; so that the father of four could be released.</p><p>&quot;I am delighted that the fight we have led has resulted in the victory of life over death,&quot; Sedillot told AFP.</p><p>Indonesia, which has some of the world&#39;s toughest drug laws, has released half a dozen high-profile detainees in recent weeks.</p><p>They include a Filipina mother on death row and the last five members of the &quot;Bali Nine&quot; drug ring.</p><p>Atlaoui was tight-lipped and wore a face mask at an earlier news conference after he was driven in a black van from Jakarta&#39;s Salemba prison to the city&#39;s main airport and handed over to French police officers.</p><p>French ambassador Fabien Penone thanked Indonesian authorities for allowing the transfer.</p><p>- &#39;Glimmer of hope&#39; -</p><p>Sedillot earlier described Atlaoui as &quot;happy and calm&quot; but said he would &quot;need a little bit of time to reorganise himself&quot;.</p><p>Jakarta has left it to the French government to grant Atlaoui -- the only Frenchman on death row in Indonesia -- either clemency, amnesty or a reduced sentence.</p><p>His return was made possible after an agreement between French Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin and his Indonesian counterpart, Yusril Ihza Mahendra, on January 24.</p><p>In the agreement, Jakarta said they had decided not to execute Atlaoui and authorised his return on &quot;humanitarian grounds&quot; because he was ill.</p><p>Atlaoui had been receiving weekly medical treatment at a hospital.</p><p>&quot;After all these years of incarceration, this is the moment I was waiting for,&quot; his wife Sabine told RTL radio.</p><div

executive Benedetto Vigna also confirmed during a conference call that Ferrari would launch its first all-electric vehicle on October 9, one of six new models introduced this year.</p><p>Profit was up 21 percent on the previous year to 1.53 billion euros ($1.58 billion), beating the 1.46 billion euros predicted by analysts surveyed by Factset.</p><p>For the fourth quarter alone, net profit climbed 31 percent from the period the year before to 386 million euros, also ahead of forecasts.</p><p>Revenues reached 6.68 billion euros over the full year, surpassing Ferrari&#39;s own target of more than 6.55 billion euros.</p><p>Yet the company sold just 89 more cars compared to the previous year, with shipments increasing barely one percent to 13,752.</p><p>&quot;Quality of revenues over volumes -- I believe this best explains our outstanding financial results in 2024, thanks to a strong product mix and a growing demand for personalisations,&quot; Vigna said in the earnings statement.</p><p>&quot;On these solid foundations, we expect further robust growth in 2025, that will allow us to reach one year in advance the high-end of most of our profitability targets for 2026,&quot; he said.</p><p>Under a strategic plan adopted in June 2022, Ferrari forecast turnover of up to 6.7 billion euros by 2026, fuelled by the launch of 15 new models over the 2023-2026 period.</p><p>During the call, Vigna also revealed that many Ferrari owners come back for more.</p><p>&quot;In 2024, we sold approximately 81 percent of our new cars to existing Ferrari clients and 48 percent to clients who currently own more than one Ferrari,&quot; he said.</p><p>Europe, the Middle East and Africa remained the company&#39;s main markets last year, with 6,204 vehicles delivered overall, up two percent on the year.</p><p>Shipments fell 22 percent to mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, to 1,162 units.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button

preceding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s arrival in Washington on Monday to meet with President Donald Trump, Israeli officials and right-wing allies of Netanyahu in the United States have attacked Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, and Qatar’s role as a critical broker of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement.</span></p><p><span>The effort to undermine Witkoff and Qatar raises fears among ceasefire supporters that while Netanyahu outwardly supports the Trump-backed ceasefire deal, he is quietly trying to delay — or even scuttle — the second phase of the ceasefire, which would fully end the war in Gaza.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“They’re undermining President Donald Trump,” said an American close to both the Trump administration and Gulf Arab countries, who requested anonymity to speak without authorization. “It’s President Donald Trump’s deal, and President Donald Trump’s best friend who’s his official representative on the

An end to the war is likely to also bring a moment of political reckoning for Netanyahu over his failure to prevent the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack, and increase the likelihood he faces legal consequences for alleged corruption, according to the former official, who requested anonymity to speak freely.</p><p>“Bibi Netanyahu gets to continue his war, which means he gets to continue his government, and at the end of the day that seems to be driving decision-making on Balfour Street more than what’s best for the people of Israel and for the country of Israel,” said the former senior U.S. official, referencing the Jerusalem street where the Israeli prime minister’s office is located. “And if he can do that by tearing down both Witkoff and Qatar in the same breath, all the better, because it fits a narrative that also relieves him of responsibility for October 7.”</p><p>The former U.S. official also said he has spoken to career officials in the Israeli government who share his concerns that Netanyahu is trying to obstruct full implementation of the ceasefire agreement.</p><p>Netanyahu’s <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-02-01/ty-article/.premium/sources-netanyahu-to-add-dermer-to-gaza-talks-replace-mossad-chief-as-u-s-liaison/00000194-c2fc-d78d-affc-e3ff82030000\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:decision;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">decision</a> to have aide Ron Dermer, a hawkish loyalist, take over as head of the hostage negotiation team with a focus on handling interactions with the United States has only heightened those concerns for ceasefire supporters.

These right-wing Israelis have pilloried Qatar, a major non-NATO U.S. ally, for hosting Hamas’ political leadership and for previously providing cash aid in Gaza that included salary payments for Hamas’ government employees.

For example, he campaigned heavily on brokering a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, despite neoconservatives’ insistence on funding and arming Ukraine even more aggressively than the United States already is.</p><p>Trump’s record on Israel-Palestine policy, by contrast, has generally been more to neoconservatives’ liking. In his first term, Trump tore up the Iran nuclear agreement, moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, and approved of Israel’s settlement expansion spree. And as a candidate in 2024, Trump promised to be more pro-Israel than Biden, whom he dubbed a “Palestinian.”</p><p>But Trump’s insistence on a ceasefire deal, selection of Witkoff and decision to end <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/politics/trump-pompeo-security-iran.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:federally provided security protection;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">federally provided security protection</a> for Iran hawks from his first administration have spooked some right-wing Israelis and their allies in the United States.

Her gaunt, heavily lined face made her look older than I expected. She wore a dingy pumpkin-orange thrift-store turtleneck that swallowed her 5-foot-7, 98-pound frame. But her ice-blue eyes sparkled like a kid’s on Christmas morning.</p><p>“Oh boy! Oh boy,” she said, walking toward me with outstretched arms. “It’s so good to see you!”</p><p>That was the first of many visits. Most followed the same script: her astonished joy upon my arrival, my mechanical hug, and then sitting on her couch to talk about her favorite topic, classic torch love songs from the 1950s and early ’60s.</p><p>“Who’s the better singer?” I’d ask. “Frank Sinatra or Nat King Cole?”</p><p>She’d close her eyes to ponder. “Nat King Cole,” she’d announce, nodding in reverence.</p><p>After about an hour, I’d stand to leave. Her smile would evaporate. Another awkward hug. As I left, she’d call out, “Don’t take any wooden nickels.”</p><p>On the surface, we had nothing in common. She was a white Irish Catholic woman who grew up in a famil<em>y</em> that freely used the N-word, thought that Black people were lazy, and believed that Black and white people should live apart. I was a young Black man who grew up primarily in foster homes in a Black inner-city neighborhood where just about everyone — including me — regarded white people with distrust or contempt.</p><p>Yet she was my mother. And, as the years have passed, she’s become something else. She’s the person I find myself turning to when I struggle with the mixture of emotions that so many Americans are experiencing right now. Many of us are exhausted, demoralized, and drained by constant political and racial divisions. Countless Americans have become,&nbsp;as author David Brooks <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/opinion/trump-biden-fatigue.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:put it;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">put it</a>&nbsp;in a recent essay, “passive, discouraged. … They’ve lost the confidence to wish for more.”</p><p>I’ve been swimming in this grim national mood for years. As a journalist at CNN and elsewhere, I’ve covered virtually every so-called racially transformative event in America during the past 32 years, from the Rodney King riots in 1992 to the George Floyd “racial reckoning.” All of them generated massive hope for transformational change; all were followed by a massive letdown. At my lowest moments, I’ve wondered whether human beings are too susceptible to racism and tribalism to make democracy work.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>But my mother offered another way to look at the future, without ever intending to do so.

When I was born in the mid-1960s, interracial marriage and intimate interracial relationships were <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/loving-v-virginia\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:illegal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">illegal</a> in <a href=\"https://sharetngov.tnsosfiles.com/tsla/exhibits/blackhistory/pdfs/Miscegenation%20laws.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Maryland;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Maryland</a>, as in much of the country. My mother vanished from my life not long after I was born, and so did her family. No one told me why. I didn’t know what she looked like. My father’s name was on my birth certificate, but hers was not. All he told me and my younger brother, Patrick, was this: ”Your mother’s name is Shirley, she’s white, and her family hates Black people.”</p><p>Their hatred did not surprise me. I grew up in a West Baltimore neighborhood that served as the setting for the HBO series “The Wire,” a crime drama that depicted a Black inner-city community ravaged by racism and drug violence. I routinely heard my friends and neighbors refer to white people as “honkies” and “crackers.” I heard white people yell “Nigger!” when I strayed into their neighborhoods. During my entire time in Baltimore’s public schools — from Head Start to high school graduation — I saw only one white student.</p><p>It wasn’t the time or place to be biracial. There were no biracial public figures like former President Barack Obama or former Vice President Kamala Harris when I grew up in the 1970s and early ’80s. I was too ashamed to tell anyone my mother was white. I marked her race as “Black” on school forms. I became a closeted biracial person.</p><p>At 17, though, I discovered that there was one place worse than my neighborhood: where I first met my mom. There was another reason why I tried not to stare when I first saw her. I was trying to hide my emotions because I was in shock. I was standing in the waiting room of a psychiatric facility called <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/crownsville-hospital-center\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Crownsville Hospital Center;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Crownsville Hospital Center</a> in rural Maryland.</p><p>My mother had been diagnosed with <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizophrenia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354443\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:schizophrenia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">schizophrenia</a>, a severe mental illness. I didn’t make that discovery until I met her in Crownsville. No one in my family, including my father, had told me — not even on the car ride to the hospital. They didn’t know how. My father had waited until I had graduated from high school to suddenly ask me one day if I wanted to meet my mom. He didn’t think I could handle knowing about her illness until I became a young man. Many people didn’t talk openly about mental illness in their families when I met my mother in the early 1980s.</p><p>For over 30 years, I blocked out most of the memories from that first meeting, but one detail lingered. Before I left, my mother looked at me and made a request.</p><p>“Will you send me a St. Jude prayer book?” she asked.</p><p>“Ah, yeah, I will,” I said, not knowing at the time that St. Jude is the patron saint of hopeless causes.</p><p>Outwardly, I didn’t skip a beat after that meeting. I attended and graduated from Howard University, a historically Black college in Washington, D.C., where Kamala Harris was a classmate. I became a journalist at several newspapers before joining CNN. But I had stepped out of one closet into another. Now, I was ashamed that my mother had a mental illness. I didn’t even tell my closest friends. It took two years to tell the woman I would date and marry about my mom’s illness — and another two into our marriage before allowing them to meet.</p><p>In the life I hid from others, I tried to build a relationship with my mom. I wrote her a flood of letters, telling her about myself, my dreams and my hope that we could get to know each other. There would be no reply for months, and then a letter would finally arrive. I’d tear it open to find a single sheet from a yellow legal pad, with large cursive letters spilling over the margins: “<em>Dear John! I could use some money and to see you in person. Could you send a picture of yourself and Pat for Mother’s Day? I need another St. Jude prayer book. Love, Shirley.</em>”</p><p>Personal visits were no better. She would drift away in the middle of conversations. She’d forget what we talked about two minutes earlier. Her lips would tremble, and she’d lapse into silence if I asked too many questions about her past. At times, she’d sense my frustration, turn to me and say with a rueful smile, “Don’t mind me. I’m crazy.”</p><p>Each visit left me more depressed. My mother had been a mystery when I had no contact with her — and even more so once she was in my life. Her mental illness was like a thick fog; I didn’t know how to navigate around it to see her. All I could see was schizophrenia.</p><p>In my 30s, I gave up. I stopped writing her letters and trying to reach her through conversations. I kept visiting her and mailing her St. Jude trinkets, but I was just checking a box. Our visits were filled with awkward silences. I didn’t expect our relationship to change.</p><p>One day, when my wife, Terry, asked me why I didn’t talk more about my mother, I cut her off.</p><p>“All I do is send her money,” I said with a heavy sigh. “I can’t really communicate with her. There’s nothing left to tell.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 495px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:79%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Shirley Dailey, the author&#39;s mom, at around age 20. \" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jUf.ll_vcpYNKqg7rNe_Gw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD05NzY-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/e206000c6388a7fb728506d4270d3fa1><noscript><img alt=\"Shirley Dailey, the author&#39;s mom, at around age 20. \" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jUf.ll_vcpYNKqg7rNe_Gw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD05NzY-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/e206000c6388a7fb728506d4270d3fa1 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Shirley Dailey, the author's mom, at around age 20. \"This was the same age when she gave birth to me,\" the author writes. \"Here she's in the dining room of my father’s house in Baltimore, Maryland, not long after she met him.\" <span class=\"copyright\">Courtesy John Blake</span></figcaption></div></figure><p>***</p><p>But there was so much to her story that had not been told. One night, when I was about 19, my father reached into a Ziploc bag and pulled out a sepia-stained black-and-white photo. In the photo, a young white woman with a beehive hairdo looked at the camera with a wide, dimpled smile. She was holding a cigarette in her right hand and looked like she was about to burst into laughter. She looked confident, and her eyes sparkled with intelligence and mischief. It was my mother. The photo was taken when she was 20, the same year she gave birth to me. I couldn’t stop staring at the photo. It bore little resemblance to the fragile woman I knew.</p><p>I set out to learn about the woman in that photo. I pressed relatives to talk about my parents’ relationship. I knew the outline: They met in 1963 at a hospital in downtown Baltimore. My mother was a nurse’s assistant, and my father, Clifton Sr., was in the Merchant Marines. Their first date was a disaster. My father couldn’t persuade a Black cabdriver to take him to my mom’s house because she lived in a white working-class neighborhood where no Blacks dared venture. When my father finally did knock on her door, her father answered. He tried to shove my father off the doorstep and called the police. “This nigger is trying to see my daughter,” my mother’s father told the arriving officers. They arrested my father for disturbing the peace.</p><p>My mother decided that she would visit my father instead. She started taking walks toward my father’s house in West Baltimore, which was the central meeting place for my father’s extended family. My relatives described her as “quick-witted,” “chatty” and driven to help people in need. She sat on my father’s front steps, smoking Marlboro cigarettes with my uncles, and hung out in the kitchen to watch my paternal grandmother, Daisy, sing Negro spirituals while baking sweet potato pies.</p><p>My father’s family didn’t know what to make of her. In the early 1960s, white politicians routinely <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/03/us/interracial-marriage-blake-cec/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:warned;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">warned</a> against the evils of “race-mixing.” Psychiatrists <a href=\"https://magazine.blogs.wesleyan.edu/2003/08/04/a-fading-taboo/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:declared;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">declared</a> in scholarly journals that whites who married or “mated” with Blacks had a death wish or <a href=\"https://artsci.washu.edu/before-loving\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:sought an outlet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">sought an outlet</a> for “deviant” sexual urges. Baltimore passed the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/5/10/8578077/baltimore-segregation-pietila\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:nation’s first;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">nation’s first</a> racially restrictive housing law in 1910, which banned Black people from buying homes in white neighborhoods and vice versa, and was heavily segregated when my parents met. My father’s relatives chuckled as they recalled a 20-year-old white woman walking alone into an all-Black neighborhood to see a Black man.</p><p>“It was like a breakthrough,” my cousin Reese recalled. “She was a white woman on the block, not scared, not worried about being attacked, not looking over her shoulder. She didn’t seem to be conscious of her color. She was like one of the family.”</p><p>I then heard stories that filled a hole in my heart that I didn’t even know was there. Unprompted, relatives recounted memories of a doting young mom who took her two children on walks in the park, rubbed her nose against their bellies while they giggled and sang Patsy Cline and Tony Bennett songs to them. My mom loved to sing one song in particular to me, Doris Day’s <strong>“</strong><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/life-of-a-song/que-sera-sera.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Que Sera Sera;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Que Sera Sera</a> (Whatever Will Be, Will Be).” Try as I might, though, I have no memories of those moments.</p><p>Mercifully, I also have no memory of what happened next. My mother’s illness became apparent after she gave birth to Patrick, nine months after I was born. She started drifting away during conversations, chain-smoking and disappearing for long solitary walks. She couldn’t keep a job. When my parents moved into an apartment together, she’d leave with the gas stove on or the front door ajar. My parents never married.</p><p>“She tried, but she didn’t have the capacity to do normal things,” my father told me. “She wanted to be accepted like normal people.”</p><p>And then one day, my relatives said, she disappeared. Years later, Patrick accidentally discovered the reason why while consulting her Social Security records. Her father had placed her in a psychiatric facility, <a href=\"https://magazine.blogs.wesleyan.edu/2003/08/04/a-fading-taboo/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:a not uncommon;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">a not uncommon</a> fate in the 1950s and early 1960s for white women in interracial relationships.</p><p>Hearing how my parents’ relationship ended left me emotionally numb.

It’s a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/us/elections/the-next-generation.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:snapshot;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">snapshot</a> of Kamala Harris taken last summer during her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. It was shot from the point of view of a brown biracial girl in a pink pantsuit and pigtails, transfixed as she gazes upward at Harris from the front row at the United Center in Chicago. The girl is <a href=\"https://www.today.com/parents/kamala-harris-great-nieces-rcna167873\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Amara,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Amara,</a>&nbsp;Harris’ great-niece, age 8.</p><p>It’s easy to see why the photo went viral. It was a sneak preview of a Brown New America.

And some of our most prominent public figures — Obama, Harris, film director Jordan Peele and NFL quarterback Patrick Mahomes — are biracial.</p><p>The acceptance of interracial marriage cuts across racial and partisan lines. Harris and Doug Emhoff, her Jewish husband, were the first interracial couple to reach the highest levels of the executive branch, but they were immediately followed by another interracial couple, GOP Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, the daughter of Indian immigrants. Some white supremacists objected to Usha Vance’s race but even within the MAGA universe there is widespread acceptance of the Vances’ interracial marriage.</p><p>Someday, perhaps soon, an interracial couple will occupy the White House.</p><p>It’s easy to miss, but Usha Vance’s ascension and Harris’ groundbreaking run for the White House represents one of the greatest victories of the Civil Rights Movement: the normalization of interracial marriage and biracial people throughout America. When Judge <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2022/04/in-historic-first-ketanji-brown-jackson-is-confirmed-to-supreme-court/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Ketanji Brown Jackson;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Ketanji Brown Jackson</a> was sworn in as a Supreme Court justice in 2022, few if any news stories dwelled on the fact that her husband is white.</p><p>The casual acceptance of interracial couples at even the highest echelon of American life demonstrates something that’s so important to remember today: how quickly people’s attitudes on seemingly intractable issues can shift. When a Gallup poll asked Americans about their views on marriage between Black and white people in 1958, only 4% approved. Gallup asked the same question in 2021, and <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/354638/approval-interracial-marriage-new-high.aspx#:~:text=The%20percentages%20of%20Americans%20who,poll%20conducted%20July%206%2D21.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:94% approved;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">94% approved</a> — an all-time high. Public opinion about one of the most entrenched racial taboos in American history went from near-universal disapproval to virtual universal approval within a lifetime.</p><p>How did this happen? The quick answer is that in June 1967, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously struck down “anti-miscegenation” laws in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1966/395\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Loving v. Virginia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Loving v. Virginia</a>&nbsp;case. But something else also made it happen. It was a choice that certain people made and a type of courage they all displayed. One of them was my mom.</p><p>I only saw my mom as this fragile flower, but my brother, Patrick, was the first to notice another side to her. One morning, he took her to a hair salon that served women in a group home where our mom lived. She had been transferred to the home with other women with severe mental illnesses after Crownsville was <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/2013/10/24/film-to-document-crownsville-hospitals-history/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:shut down;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">shut down</a>, in part, for mistreating patients. While they were waiting, our mom watched a hairdresser berate and throw hair products at a woman sitting in her chair.</p><p>“She’s a bitch,” my mom said, her eyes narrowed on the hairdresser.</p><p>Patrick had never heard our mother speak in such an indignant tone before. He suppressed a smile.</p><p>“Mom, do you know you just said a bad word?”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Pat.” Our mom briefly paused, then added, “But she is a bitch.”</p><p>As I dug deeper into old family stories, I discovered that my mom had long been infuriated by any display of injustice. She glared back at white people who stared at her while she walked in public with my father in the early 1960s. Sometimes she’d say, “You act like you ain’t never seen people before.” She and my father trashed a bar when the bartender refused to serve them. Once, I heard my mom say she had been arrested as a young woman. For what, I inquired. “For opening my big fat mouth,” she said with a wide grin.</p><p>Even her illness couldn’t erase her spirit of defiance. I hated visiting her group homes. Some were run by good people who treated my mom with compassion, but many seemed designed to crush whatever humanity was left of those consigned there. Unscrupulous caretakers stole from or bullied people in their care. Some confined them to squalid, roach-infested rooms. When I came in to greet my mom, I’d often see heavily medicated residents sitting on couches, staring zombie-like at soap operas on television. Most of them hadn’t received a visitor in years. There were few smiles or genuine laughter in these environments. But my mom could somehow bring light into the most desolate places.</p><p>Patrick sneaked into a group home to surprise our mom one morning, only to be shocked by what he saw: our mother bopping and weaving down a “Soul Train” dance line as the group home staff and residents cheered her on. Any gifts we sent her quickly disappeared because, we discovered, she gave most of them away to other group home members who she said needed them more. And when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, her caretaker had to buy a separate living room chair for my mom to enforce social distancing rules. All of the group home members wanted to sit near her.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 623px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:99%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"The author, age 13, (left) with his father, Clifton &#x00201c;Tony&#x00201d; Blake Sr., and his brother, Patrick, age 12.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zIBn9USsQ3wJs6UZU7Rs2Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xMjI4/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/7630a3eaf1b72521c02b35940f3fd163><noscript><img alt=\"The author, age 13, (left) with his father, Clifton &#x00201c;Tony&#x00201d; Blake Sr., and his brother, Patrick, age 12.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zIBn9USsQ3wJs6UZU7Rs2Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xMjI4/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/7630a3eaf1b72521c02b35940f3fd163 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>The author, age 13, (left) with his father, Clifton “Tony” Blake Sr., and his brother, Patrick, age 12. <span class=\"copyright\">Courtesy John Blake</span></figcaption></div></figure><p>I didn’t appreciate the depth of her defiance until I was in my mid-50s, when I did something that I had never done: I traveled to her childhood home in Baltimore.</p><p>On an overcast summer morning, I drove to <a href=\"https://chap.baltimorecity.gov/historic-districts/maps/2600blockmillhilldeckofcardswilkinsave\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Mill Hill;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Mill Hill</a>, my mother’s childhood community. She lived on Wilkins Avenue, on a quintessential Baltimore block of gleaming marble steps, neat row houses and a still-stately <a href=\"https://www.saintbenedict.org/archive/archive\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:St. Benedict Church,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">St. Benedict Church,</a> where my mom was confirmed. I parked my rental car and walked to the spot where my father had been assaulted and arrested for trying to date my mother over 50 years ago. I scanned the street to see white, Black and brown neighbors talking to one another from their front steps and hanging out together at a corner tavern.</p><p>I was surprised by something other than the racial mix. When I looked at my smartphone’s app, I was stunned to discover that my father’s former home was only 4.1 miles away. I had no idea that my estranged white and Black relatives had lived so close to one another. Racial segregation was so entrenched when my parents met that their families might as well have lived in separate solar systems. Baltimore’s segregation wasn’t just racial; it was also ethnic. Jews, Italians and Poles kept to their neighborhoods. Outsiders, particularly those who had the “wrong” color, risked getting hurt walking into the wrong area.</p><p>As I stood in front of my mom’s childhood home, I imagined for the first time what it must have been like for her. The contemporary Wilkins Avenue landscape dissolved, and the circa early 1960s Wilkins Avenue appeared. I saw her — a thin, young white woman with a beehive hairdo — close the front door and walk toward a neighborhood to meet people her family and community had told her to hate.</p><p>I paused outside my car and shook my head in admiration, and confusion.</p><p><em>Damn</em>, I thought. <em>Why would she take such a risk</em>?</p><p>I’m still not quite sure. Was my mother’s relationship with my father driven by youthful rebellion, the allure of a taboo relationship, or was it an early symptom of the illness that would engulf her? Or was it truly love? I learned through others that my parents remained close after she was institutionalized. My father routinely visited my mother and continued to take care of her even when his health began to fail late in his life.</p><p>What I do know is that she did something that remains so important: She refused to accept the status quo. My mother was part of a vanguard of Black, brown and white people who would smash a taboo against interracial relationships that had been enshrined as law for centuries. They didn’t wait for the Supreme Court or politicians to tell them whom to love. I was born four years before the Loving decision.</p><p>Like most big changes, it started small, with countless acts of invisible courage from everyday people. My mother’s decision to walk from Wilkins Avenue to my father’s house “<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/705426-each-time-a-man-stands-up-for-an-ideal-or\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:sent forth a tiny ripple of hope;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">sent forth a tiny ripple of hope</a>.” That ripple fed into another, emboldening others to do the same. Those ripples eventually turned into a tsunami that gave us the Loving decision and a New America — one where a brown girl in a pink pantsuit could look at a biracial woman making a credible run for the White House or another brown woman at the White House today and think, “That could be me one day.” This was the same dynamic that gave us marriage equality. Everyday people acted first, coming out to their parents, friends and co-workers; the politicians and courts followed later.</p><p>As I returned to my car and drove away from Wilkins Avenue, I smiled. I felt a warm sensation well up in my chest, and something else that I’d never felt before about my mom: pride. Pride that I was her son. She was no hopeless cause. She was more powerful than she realized. She, and others like her, helped make Usha Vance and Kamala Harris possible.</p><p>The historian and activist <a href=\"https://www.howardzinn.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Howard Zinn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Howard Zinn</a> said there is a <a href=\"https://www.howardzinn.org/collection/the-optimism-of-uncertainty/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:tendency;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">tendency</a> among people “to think that what we see in the present moment will continue.” He said people often forget how often throughout history people have been astonished by extraordinary changes in people’s thoughts, by unexpected eruptions of rebellion against tyrannies, and “by the quick collapse of systems of power that seemed invincible.”</p><p>He said that if people only look at the worst in the past and present, it destroys their capacity to act.</p><p>“And if we do act, in however small a way, we don’t have to wait for some grand utopian future,” Zinn <a href=\"https://www.awakin.org/v2/read/view.php?tid=321\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:wrote.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">wrote.</a> “The future is an infinite succession of presents, and to live now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of all that is bad around us, is itself a marvelous victory.”</p><p>***</p><p>After Wilkins Avenue, my visits to my mom changed. I painted her fingernails. I asked her to sing “Que Sera Sera.” I asked her to show me some dance moves. And I laughed along with her as she did a little shimmy of her hips. I stopped dwelling on what I had lost; I became grateful for what remained. My wife noticed.</p><p>“You used to hug your mom like she was an eggshell and get frustrated when you couldn’t talk to her the way you wanted,” Terry told me one night.</p><p>“And now?” I asked her.</p><p>“You hug her tighter now, and you’re not afraid of the silence when you talk to her.”</p><p>During one of my last visits with my mom, Terry took a photo that I treasure. We stopped by my mother’s group home in Baltimore on a luminous summer day with oak trees in full bloom. That visit followed the same script: a ring of the doorbell, the scurrying of footsteps behind the front door, and my mom gleefully shouting, “Oh my Lord, Oh my Lord!”</p><p>Terry’s smartphone camera snapped what happened after the front door swung open. I leaned forward and wrapped my arms around my mother as she pillowed her face on my shoulder, a contented smile on her face.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 352px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"The author hugging his mother as he greets her at the entrance of her home in West Baltimore.

cold and the prospect of an escalating trade war.</p><p>The tariffs on US energy, vehicles and equipment were unveiled minutes after additional levies on Chinese goods announced Saturday by US President Donald Trump came into effect.</p><p>Tariffs on a wider range of goods were announced by Chinese authorities on Tuesday.</p><p>Trump&#39;s move was the latest in a trade confrontation between the global superpowers that started eight years ago, in his first term.</p><p>Out for a stroll on the last day of China&#39;s Lunar New Year holiday, many who talked to AFP seemed largely unfazed by the news.</p><p>&quot;Now with the regular trade war, such as the restrictions on semiconductors, I think it is good (for China),&quot; said a 48-year-old man surnamed Nian.</p><p>&quot;We will be autonomous -- we will be better,&quot; he said, using the example of Chinese AI firm DeepSeek, which made headlines recently with a chatbot which can match its American competitors seemingly at a fraction of the cost.</p><p>US export controls on high-tech chips may have inadvertently fuelled its success, analysts have said, spurring the firm to develop clever ways to overcome them.</p><p>Nian said that the Chinese economy could weather the stormy relationship with Washington.</p><p>- &#39;Lives basically unaffected&#39; -</p><p>&quot;People&#39;s lives are basically unaffected, and the domestic demand of so many people (in China) is completely enough,&quot; he said.</p><p>The government has been trying to boost domestic consumption, which has remained stubbornly sluggish post-Covid, dragging on growth.</p><p>Staring across the similarly slow-moving grey waters of the Huangpu river, 36-year-old Zhou said he thought most Chinese were nevertheless &quot;relatively confident&quot; about the economy long-term.</p><p>But &quot;when there is this type of trade war... the most fundamental harm is actually to the interests of normal people&quot;, he warned, gesturing to his iPhone as an example of a product he said could be affected eventually.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp

world&#39;s two largest economies as &quot;healthy competition&quot;.</p><p>&quot;The leaders of every country are just defending their own interests,&quot; he told AFP.</p><p>Sitting beside her livestreaming equipment on a bench, 42-year-old Karen Zhang said she was concerned tariffs would have an impact on life for those living in China&#39;s big international cities.</p><p>However, she said Beijing was right to retaliate. </p><p>&quot;I think overall this is definitely not a good thing, but China also has no choice,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;The United States has been carrying out some very severe measures and policies against China. So China has to fight back... we can&#39;t let them casually bully us,&quot; she said.</p><p>Her view was echoed by Nian. </p><p>&quot;I think we should take countermeasures,&quot; he said. &quot;We should be a bit more ruthless.&quot;</p><p>reb-fox</p></div></article></div>",
