accordance with the recent President Actions under Executive Order, ‘Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.’” </span></p><p><span>The executive order, which President Donald Trump signed within hours of taking office, declares that there are only “two sexes, male and female,” and redefines sex by the reproductive cells a person will produce upon reaching adulthood.</span></p><p><span>The order tasked agencies across the government to amend policies to reflect what it calls “the biological reality of sex,” a definition that denies

The SSA keeps demographic records for statistical purposes, and sometimes SSA gender data is used for identity verification from third parties. </span></p><p><span>The agency did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on Monday.</span></p><p><span>The agency’s message on Friday reversed a 2022 </span><a href=\"https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/human-rights-campaign-applauds-social-security-administration-for-new-policy-allowing-people-to-self-select-their-gender-in-social-security-records\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Biden administration policy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>Biden administration policy</span></a><span> allowing people to self-select their gender in Social Security records without any barriers.

It was a response to a question about mifepristone, one of two drugs used for medication abortion.</span></p><p><span>As HuffPost’s Alanna Vagianos has </span><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rfk-jr-will-study-the-safety-of-abortion-pill-on-trumps-orders_n_679a71e5e4b0c5507e4ae06e\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:written;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>written</span></a><span>, roughly 6 million Americans have taken the drug since 2000, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration first gave its approval.

They want the FDA to withdraw its approval of mifepristone ― or, at the very least, to stop its distribution by telehealth and mail.</span></p><p><span>The FDA is part of the Health and Human Services Department, and many of these abortion rights opponents aren’t sure they’ll have an ally in Kennedy, given his past support for abortion rights. Among those wary of Kennedy are some Republican senators, including a few who will be part of Tuesday’s planned Finance Committee vote on his nomination.</span></p><p><span>In last week’s hearings, Kennedy addressed their concerns directly.</span></p><p><span>“President Trump has asked me to study the safety of mifepristone,” Kennedy said in response to a question from a Republican senator. “He has not yet taken a stand on how to regulate it.

And the union has offered federal employees a place to get answers to their questions together; a recent AFGE meeting brought together roughly 1,600 people, according to one attendee.</span></p><p><span>“I don’t know anybody who is taking this offer,” one federal scientist said of the deferred resignation pitch. “The buyout that’s not even real?”</span></p><p><span>Ironically, the “Fork in the Road” email that went out was also being flagged as a scam by the security system built into federal employees’ inboxes.</span></p><p><span>“We have a very clear email button for reporting phishing,” said a second EPA employee. “The amount of people who have reported this as phishing is very high. It reads, ‘scam.’ Literally, that ‘Fork in the Road’ email.”</span></p><p><span>This EPA staffer marveled at the volume of attorneys who likely received that email and could see how nonsensical it was ― a sign that, for all their threats and intimidation, at least some of the Trump administration is a sloppy mess.</span></p><p><span>“Whoever wrote that email really underestimated who they were sending it to,” this person said. “I very much feel like the general consensus is we are scared, but we are digging in.”</span></p><p>Several federal employees and their supporters have taken to the social media platform Reddit to connect and share their plans for fighting what is happening.</p><p>“This non ‘buyout’ really seems to have backfired,” reads <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/fednews/comments/1icj3wc/this_non_buyout_really_seems_to_have_backfired/?share_id=Po2-ydCITo-65j8lUjs95&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1&amp;rdt=42714\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:one thread last week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">one thread last week</a> by an anonymous federal employee that drew lots of engagement. “I’ll be honest, before that email went out, I was looking for any way to get out of this fresh hell.

Some don’t know how they can fight back in their particular jobs and are worried that Trump is setting up the entirety of the government to fail by fueling mistrust and fear of retribution within its ranks.</span></p><p><span>“I am terrified,” said one Interior Department employee. “I want to speak up, for I know what is happening is wrong, yet I know if my protests reach the wrong ears I will be fired without hesitation and I have a family to provide for. Bosses are forced to enforce policies they deeply disagree with, but must or face further punishment for them and their teams.”</span></p><p><span>“I do not use this term lightly,” said this federal worker, “but it feels very fascist.”</span></p><p><span>That’s the sentiment shared by at least one State Department employee, who described messages from higher-ups instructing them to expose colleagues who they think may be working on DEI initiatives or otherwise “face adverse consequences.” This federal worker also discovered that at least one instructor of a routine departmental training was told they weren’t allowed to use the phrase “the Biden administration” or talk about the last four years at all.</span></p><p><span>“It is like 1984,” said this employee, referring to the dystopian novel by George Orwell about a fictional dictator that controls everything and constantly monitors people.</span></p><p><span>A State Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p><p><span>A Defense Department employee, meanwhile, fumed about Trump’s “short-sighted and performative” decision to require all employees to return to in-person work.</span></p><p><span>“There are people I work with who do incredible work while working from home that will likely lose their job because of this. Some of them purchased a home and moved away based on this work agreement,” said this employee. “A 30-day grace period for such a significant change is a slap in the face to those who work hard.”</span></p><p><span>What’s especially ridiculous, this person said, is that federal office buildings outside of Washington, D.C., often don’t have enough desks, cubicles or shared work spaces to accommodate everyone returning to in-person work because these facilities have never been properly funded.</span></p><p><span>“Assuming all federal office buildings function like those in D.C. is insulting and infuriating,” said this Defense Department staffer.</span></p><div class=\"caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy\" data-src><blockquote class=\"caas-blockquote caas-pull-quote\"><span class=\"quotemark icon\"><svg width=42 height=29 viewBox=\"0 0 20 14\"><path d=\"M15.5222734,14 C18.5215054,14 20,12.4159021 20,9.76146789 C20,7.23547401 18.7327189,5.90825688 16.3248848,5.73700306 C16.8740399,3.93883792 17.8456221,2.01223242 18.9016897,0.29969419 L18.9016897,0 L14.3394777,0 C12.6075269,2.6116208 10.8333333,6.03669725 10.8333333,9.03363914 C10.8333333,12.2446483 12.3963134,14 15.5222734,14 Z M4.70948012,14 C7.6529052,14 9.16666667,12.4159021 9.16666667,9.76146789 C9.16666667,7.23547401 7.82110092,5.86544343 5.46636086,5.73700306 C6.01299694,3.93883792 6.98012232,2.01223242 8.0733945,0.29969419 L8.0733945,0 L3.53211009,0 C1.80810398,2.6116208 0,6.03669725 0,9.03363914 C0,12.2446483 1.5558104,14 4.70948012,14 Z\" /></svg></span><p>I do not use this term lightly, but it feels very fascist.<span class=\"attribution\">A federal employee at the Interior Department</span></p></blockquote></div><p><span>Civil servants from across federal agencies, from NASA to the U.S. Navy to the National Park Service, also emphasized that a big reason they’re ready to fight Trump’s efforts to dismantle the government isn’t just because they need a job. They described their pride in working on something bigger than themselves and in taking an oath to the Constitution to serve their country.</span></p><p><span>“Not to be cheesy, but taking the oath of office really meant something to me,” said the previously mentioned federal scientist. “I feel like that obligates me to fight. I took an oath to the Constitution, to defend against all enemies, foreign and domestic.”</span></p><p>“Elon’s emails are having the opposite effect on me than what was intended, like other [federal workers],” said an Education Department staffer. “Reinvested in my work.”</p><p><span>“It’s heartbreaking that we’re at the point where nothing is certain, where even the most basic rights are suddenly in question, and where so many people ― with good cause ― are simply too exhausted and overwhelmed to continue the fight,” said one Forest Service employee.</span></p><p><span>“There’s only one thing I am sure of ― that I will work towards the protection of nature in the [redacted] National Forest until my final breath,” said this employee.</span></p><p><span>Trump isn’t showing signs of relenting in his efforts to purge career civil servants.

At least three Democrats abstained from voting.</p><p><span>Along with Lee Zeldin, President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Wright, 60, was widely seen as one of the new, right-wing administration’s least controversial Cabinet nominees.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>A Democrat from his home state, Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), introduced Wright at his </span>confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last month.<span>&nbsp;Through the three-hour public interview session before the Senate’s energy committee, Wright said he recognized the threat climate change poses but ranked a lack of steady, cheap energy as a higher priority.</span></p><p>He <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-energy-chris-wright_n_6787fa6fe4b02f1db4f82ae6\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:pledged;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">pledged</a> to put a particular focus on stemming the tide of worsening blackouts on the U.S. power grid and modernizing the country’s nuclear weapons.</p><p><span>Wright is best known as the founder of Liberty Energy, a Denver-based pioneer in hydraulic fracturing, the drilling technique known as fracking that sparked a U.S. oil and gas boom at the start of the 2010s.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But the executive repeatedly cited his past work on solar panels and battery storage, and emphasized his longstanding interest in nuclear power, the most efficient source of zero-carbon electricity and one of the most climate-friendly technologies the Trump administration is expected to champion. Wright sat on the board of Oklo, a California-based reactor startup, and studied nuclear fusion in college.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Do I wish we could make faster progress? Absolutely,” he said during the hearing. “Are there things we can do ... through the Department of Energy to accelerate development of new energy technologies that are really the only pathway to address climate change?
