(-)</figcaption></div></figure><p>US President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are expected to hold direct talks after announcing tit-for-tat tariffs in an escalating trade war, US officials said Tuesday.</p><p>Beijing said it was imposing levies on imports of US energy, vehicles and equipment in a return salvo minutes after Trump&#39;s threatened tariffs on Chinese goods came into effect.</p><p>Trump suspended duties on Mexico and Canada on Monday for a month after both countries vowed to step up measures to counter flows of the drug fentanyl and the crossing of undocumented migrants into the United States.</p><p>It was not immediately clear when the leaders of the world&#39;s two biggest economies would speak, although some said it could happen as early as Tuesday.</p><p>Stock markets wavered as investors braced for volatile market activity in the coming weeks over Trump&#39;s threatened tariffs on his country&#39;s three biggest trading partners.</p><p>&quot;Let&#39;s see what happens with the call today,&quot; Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro, a veteran of the US president&#39;s first term, told news outlet Politico.</p><p>Asked if Trump could halt the tariffs on China too, he added: &quot;It&#39;s up to the boss. I never get ahead of the boss, that&#39;s why I&#39;m sitting here.&quot;</p><p>Trump imposed fresh 10-percent tariffs on Chinese goods, on top of levies that were already in place against Washington&#39;s biggest economic competitor. Mexico and Canada had faced 25-percent tariffs.</p><p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that Trump was due to talk to Xi, but said Tuesday that &quot;I don&#39;t have any updates on when that call will take place.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He is not going to allow China to continue to source and distribute deadly fentanyl into our country, that was the reason for this tariff,&quot; Leavitt told reporters outside the West Wing of the White House.</p><p>- &#39;Malicious&#39; -</p><p>China unveiled 15-percent levies on imports of coal and liquefied natural gas from the United States, while crude oil, agricultural machinery, big-engined vehicles, and pickup trucks face 10-percent duties.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Beijing says it will also probe US tech giant Google and the US fashion group that owns Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein.</p><p>China&#39;s government said the measures were in response to the &quot;unilateral tariff hike&quot; by Washington. It said it would also file a complaint to the World Trade Organization over the &quot;malicious&quot; levies.</p><p>Additionally, it unveiled fresh export controls on rare metals and chemicals including tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, and molybdenum, used in a range of industrial appliances.</p><p>China is a major market for US energy exports and according to Beijing customs data, imports of oil, coal and LNG totaled more than $7 billion last year.</p><p>But that is dwarfed by China&#39;s imports from more friendly powers such as Russia, from which it purchased $94 billion-worth last year.</p><p>- Last-minute deals -</p><p>Trump has made tariffs a key foreign policy tool of his second term, joking that the word tariff is the &quot;most beautiful&quot; in the dictionary.</p><p>The Republican billionaire said his tariffs aimed to punish countries for failing to halt flows of illegal migrants and drugs including the powerful opioid fentanyl into the United States.</p><p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had both struck last-minute deals with Trump on Monday to tighten border measures, leading to a 30-day pause on threatened tariffs.</p><p>Talks will continue for the next month on broader pacts.</p><p>Mexico said Tuesday it had begun the 10,000-strong border troop deployment it had promised Trump as part of the agreement to halt tariffs.</p><p>&quot;The deployment has already started,&quot; Sheinbaum told reporters.</p><p>More than 450,000 people have been murdered countrywide since Mexico launched a major offensive against drug cartels in 2006.</p><p>Trudeau said Canada would appoint a &quot;Fentanyl Czar&quot; and list drug cartels as terrorist organizations.</p><p>burs-dk-bys/aha</p></div></article></div>",

the deadliest school attack in the Scandinavian country&#39;s history.</p><p>Authorities had initially said that several people were wounded in the violence at Campus Risbergska, a secondary school for young adults in the town of Orebro, but had not reported any fatalities.</p><p>School attacks are relatively rare in Sweden, but the country has suffered shootings and bombings linked to gang violence that kill dozens of people each year.</p><p>&quot;Around 10 people have been killed today,&quot; Orebro police chief Roberto Eid Forest told reporters, adding that police could &quot;not be more specific about the number due to the large number of wounded&quot;.</p><p>He provided no details about the number of wounded.</p><p>He said police were not aware of a motive yet, but believed the gunman had acted alone.</p><p>&quot;This is a terrible event. This is exceptional, a nightmare,&quot; Forest said.</p><p>Police did not disclose any information about the identity or ages of the dead, nor whether they were students or teachers at the school.</p><p>Several media reported the suspected gunman turned his gun on himself but police would not confirm those reports.</p><p>- &#39;A lot of gunshots&#39; -</p><p>Forest said police received the first reports of a school shooting at 12:33 pm (1133 GMT), but could not specify how it unfolded.</p><p>&quot;We have been working on the basis that there was ongoing deadly violence inside the school,&quot; Forest said.</p><p>The attacker is also believed to have carried some form of equipment to create smoke inside the school, he added. </p><p>Two Campus Risbergska teachers, Miriam Jarlevall and Patrik Soderman, told newspaper Dagens Nyheter they heard gunfire in a hallway.</p><p>&quot;Students came and said someone was shooting. Then we heard more shooting in the hallway. We didn&#39;t go out, we hid in our offices,&quot; they said.</p><p>&quot;There were a lot of gunshots at first and then it was quiet for a half-hour and then it started again. We were lying under our desks, cowering.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Some witnesses told Swedish media they heard what they believed to be automatic gunfire.</p><p>Swedish television channel TV4 meanwhile reported that police had raided the suspect&#39;s home in Orebro late on Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>It said the suspect was around 35 years old and had a license to carry a weapon and no criminal record, but did not provide any details about his identity.</p><p>Police have not confirmed that information.</p><p>A church near the school was open Tuesday evening to provide support to the community.</p><p>- Schools in lockdown -</p><p>Students in several nearby schools as well as the one in question had been locked in for several hours &quot;for safety reasons&quot; before gradually being released, police said.</p><p>&quot;It is a very painful day for all of Sweden,&quot; Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson wrote on X.</p><p>&quot;My thoughts are also with all those whose normal school day was replaced with horror. Being confined to a classroom fearing for your own life is a nightmare that no one should have to experience.&quot;</p><p>Kristersson, who said the government was &quot;closely monitoring developments&quot;, was to hold a press conference at 7:30 pm (1830 GMT).</p><p>A mother whose son was kept indoors at his nearby school for several hours during the police operation told AFP she was &quot;shocked&quot; and &quot;angry&quot;.</p><p>&quot;My son is at this school behind us, they&#39;re locked in too. They have to hide, so I&#39;m waiting for them to evacuate,&quot; Cia Sandell, 42, said.</p><p>&quot;This is crazy, totally crazy. I&#39;m angry, I&#39;m shocked. This shouldn&#39;t happen,&quot; she said.</p><p>Though such shootings are rare, several other violent incidents have struck Swedish schools in recent years.</p><p>In March 2022, an 18-year-old student stabbed two teachers to death at a secondary school in the southern city of Malmo.</p><p>Two months earlier, a 16-year-old was arrested after wounding another student and a teacher with a knife at a school in the small town of Kristianstad.</p><p>In October 2015, three people were killed in a racially-motivated attack at a school in the western town of Trollhattan by a sword-wielding assailant who was later killed by police.</p><p>bur-po/jll/db</p></div></article></div>",

unacceptable level of security risk&quot; presented by China&#39;s breakout artificial intelligence program, according to an official order Tuesday.</p><p>Developed by a China-based technology startup, the DeepSeek chatbot has astounded industry insiders and upended financial markets since it was released last month.</p><p>Countries including South Korea, Italy and France have expressed concerns about the program&#39;s security and data practices.</p><p>But Canberra&#39;s move overnight appears to be the toughest by a government against the Chinese chatbot.</p><p>&quot;After considering threat and risk analysis, I have determined that the use of DeepSeek products, applications and web services poses an unacceptable level of security risk to the Australian Government,&quot; Department of Home Affairs Secretary Stephanie Foster said in the directive.</p><p>As of Wednesday all non-corporate Commonwealth entities must &quot;identify and remove all existing instances of DeepSeek products, applications and web services on all Australian Government systems and mobile devices,&quot; she added.</p><p>The directive also required that &quot;access, use or installation of DeepSeek products&quot; be prevented across government systems and mobile devices.</p><p>The action is the latest by governments from around the world which have been turning a

seizing computers, hard drives and phones, and detaining two male employees &quot;who do not hold any senior management position&quot;.</p><p>It said it would not provide further comment, fearing for the security of the detained employees, and asked that the authorities &quot;take care of our colleagues and release them as soon as possible&quot;.</p><p>In a statement on social media site X the Taliban information ministry said the station had been suspended. </p><p>&quot;Besides multiple violations, it was providing materials and programmes to a TV station based abroad,&quot; it said.</p><p>&quot;Due to the violation of the broadcasting policy and improper use of the license (from the ministry), the radio station was suspended today so that the related documents can be carefully evaluated and the final decision can be taken,&quot; it added.</p><p>Radio Begum said it has never been involved in any political activity and was &quot;committed to serving the Afghan people and more specifically the Afghan women&quot;.</p><p>The station was founded on March 8, International Women&#39;s Day, 2021, five months before the Taliban swept to power, ousting the US-backed

assistance.</p><p>Rubio, currently on a Latin America tour, doubled down on President Donald Trump&#39;s 90-day suspension of assistance as reports emerge around the world of local aid groups curtailing or stopping life-saving aid.</p><p>&quot;I issued a blanket waiver that said, if this is life-saving programs, OK; if it&#39;s providing food or medicine or anything that is saving lives and is immediate and urgent, you&#39;re not included in the freeze,&quot; Rubio told reporters in Costa Rica.</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know how much more clear we can be than that,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;I would say if some organization is receiving funds from the United States and does not know how to apply a waiver, then I have real questions about the competence of that organization, or I wonder whether they&#39;re deliberately sabotaging it for purposes of making a political point,&quot; said the former Republican senator.</p><p>A day earlier, Rubio said he had been made acting head of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) as Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk look at drastically scaling back aid and merging the organization under the State Department.</p><p>Non-governmental groups say they have heard multiple cases of aid groups that have struggled to operate, mostly smaller organizations that provide targeted services such as health care or education and did not have reserves.</p><p>Some schools have shuttered in Uganda, where USAID was backing a universal education program, and demining work has been disrupted in Cambodia, among other cases.</p><p>- Targeted support to allies -</p><p>Rubio announced that he was issuing new waivers to ensure the flow of assistance to Costa Rica, a major US partner on issues including migration and drug-trafficking.</p><p>US assistance includes biometric work to stop smugglers, which Rubio pointed out as an example of concrete American help that benefits its own interests.</p><div

the example of Costa Rica, whose relations with China have turned rockier in recent years.</p><p>Chaves in 2023 effectively forbade Chinese tech titan Huawei from bidding for the nation&#39;s 5G network due to Beijing&#39;s refusal to sign an international agreement on cybercrime.</p><p>&quot;When you confront companies that are not secure, they&#39;re backed by governments like the

system in the United States, enabling students to access personalized tutoring and study guides through the chatbot, while the faculty will be able to use it for administrative tasks.</p><p>OpenAI has
