Prime Minister Francois Bayrou is expected on Wednesday to survive a no-confidence vote in parliament, winning some breathing space after less than two months in office but by no means ensuring his long-term future.</p><p>Bayrou, a veteran centrist named by President Emmanuel Macron in December to end months of political crisis, on Monday used a controversial constitutional article to ram his cost-cutting budget through parliament without a vote.</p><p>But the use of this mechanism, article 49.3, allows the opposition to put forward a no-confidence motion and the bid to topple the government was duly proposed by the hard-left France Unbowed, backed by the Communists and the Greens, to be voted on Wednesday.</p><p>But while Bayrou is nowhere near having a majority in the National Assembly, the Socialists and far-right National Rally (RN) both said they would not back the no-confidence motion.</p><p>This gives Bayrou the numbers to survive and see through the budget. But it is unlikely to be the only challenge to his shaky administration in the coming months.</p><p>Bayrou, a keen historian who has written a book on his hero French king Henri IV assassinated in Paris in 1610, is well versed in how political ambition can suddenly come to an end.</p><p>&quot;Passive support from both the Socialists and Marine Le Pen&#39;s far-right for Bayrou will end once a 2025 budget is fully enacted in the next few days,&quot; risk analysis firm Eurasia Group said, giving a 70-percent chance that the government will &quot;fall in the next few months&quot;.</p><p>- &#39;Give France a budget&#39; -</p><p>Jordan Bardella, RN leader, said his party did not intend to back the no-confidence vote adding while &quot;it&#39;s a bad budget... we need a budget&quot;.</p><p>&quot;We need to avoid uncertainty because many of our fellow citizens... are extremely worried about possible long-term instability,&quot; he said.</p><p>Socialist leader Olivier Faure said his party decided against voting to topple the government over the budget, as it would only have resulted in France having &quot;a prime minister further to the right&quot;, or even &quot;the resignation of a head of state&quot;.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;We chose to give France a budget,&quot; he told the France Inter radio station.</p><p>The move by the Socialists is a major boost for Bayrou that could mark the end of a broad left-wing alliance including the Socialists and LFI party that had endured since the election campaign.</p><p>But in a symbolic move, the party leadership decided Monday to propose a separate no-confidence motion after Bayrou referred to migrants &quot;flooding&quot; France, using terminology previously used by the far right.</p><p>However, this has little chance of passing as it is expected to be rejected by all right-wing parties.</p><p>Bayrou&#39;s predecessor Michel Barnier was toppled in a no-confidence vote late last year, leaving France in uncharted political waters.</p><p>- &#39;Need stability&#39; -</p><p>The survival of Bayrou&#39;s government will be a relief for Macron who has faced calls to resign since the middle of last year but insisted he will stay on until the end of his term, due to end in 2027.</p><p>Many analysts and even allies are still baffled by the president&#39;s decision to call snap parliamentary elections last summer which gave the far right its biggest ever foothold in a divided parliament.</p><p>The cost-cutting and tax-hiking budget has proved controversial in some quarters, with France&#39;s richest man, the luxury goods mogul Bernard Arnault, denouncing a planned special corporate tax.</p><p>&quot;We need stability,&quot; Macron said on Tuesday, while adding that &quot;we should not go backwards&quot;.</p><p>Turbulent months remain ahead in French politics.</p><p>A verdict is due in far-right leader Marine Le Pen&#39;s fake EU parliament jobs trial -- on charges she denies -- on March 31 and she could be disqualified from the 2027 elections if convicted in a major political crossroads.</p><p>far-lum-ah-sjw/as/yad/rsc</p></div></article></div>",

around mothers who use cannabis was beginning to dissolve.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>To my dismay, however, the images of this cannabis-based alternative parenting lifestyle did not include anyone who looked like me. Of course, it was suddenly OK (and even liberating) to consume weed as a mom — as long </span><a href=\"https://hightimes.com/culture/the-unbearable-whiteness-of-the-marijuana-moms/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:as you’re white;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>as you’re white</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>It appears that the </span><a href=\"https://graphics.aclu.org/marijuana-arrest-report/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:racial stigma of cannabis use;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>racial stigma of cannabis use</span></a><span> permeates every single social demographic. To disrupt that as best as I could, I created Blunt Blowin’ Mama, an online cannabis lifestyle community that aims to normalize conversations around weed use by Black and brown mothers while highlighting the BIWOC impacting change.</span><span>I have spoken to hundreds of women since launching the platform, and they’ve collectively imparted one major takeaway: Moms who use cannabis do so because they believe it makes them better humans and better parents. And Black women deserve that option, too.</span></p><p><span>While there’s a growing discourse amongst new mothers (</span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science/23732852/weed-pregnancy-prenatal-marijuana-cannabis-safety-state-policies\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:and everyone else;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>and everyone else</span></a><span>) about consuming cannabis during pregnancy, most medical experts do not recommend it. Many Black moms, such as myself, are focused instead on the potential postpartum benefits. This is a gray area I had to explore by speaking with mothers from my community about their experiences with cannabis, as well as experts (of all races) about the plant’s effects — and racial bias within the medical system.</span></p><p><span>The most salient concern about women who use weed after they’ve given birth is the chance of harming the baby through breast milk. And researchers are just now starting to examine that “chance.” As of now, there isn’t enough data to certainly predict, for example, when it would be safe to breastfeed again after smoking, vaping, or ingesting cannabis, says </span><a href=\"https://nayacare.org/about-nayacare/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Dr. Sonal Patel;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>Dr. Sonal Patel</span></a><span>, a Denver-based pediatrician and postpartum maternal health care specialist at NayaCare Clinic.</span></p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p><span>While she advises that “cannabis should be avoided after birth and as long as you are planning to breastfeed,” Patel encourages mamas to have an open dialogue with their physician about the subject of weed use. And if a parent feels their care provider is judging them regarding cannabis, they should swiftly find another.</span></p><p><span>The lack of empirical data on postpartum weed use was the overarching concern of all the experts I spoke to (think about how challenging, ethically, it is to launch medical studies on cannabis and breastfeeding). “There is very limited research about cannabis while breastfeeding. Because we don’t know the long-term effects on birthing people and their infants, I agree with major organizations such as ACOG, CDC, and AAP who recommend against the use of marijuana if breastfeeding,” says </span><a href=\"https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/profile/elizabeth-wetterer\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Dr. Libby Wetterer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>Dr. Libby Wetterer</span></a><span>, assistant professor and fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health at UPenn’s Health System.</span></p><p><span>As the CDC reminds us, the data on how cannabis can affect a child through breast milk is both </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/vaccinations-medications-drugs/marijuana.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:under-researched and conflicting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>under-researched and conflicting</span></a><span> —&nbsp;therefore, seen as a sizable risk. “It’s difficult to assess the harms of using cannabis while breastfeeding because most patients that use cannabis while breastfeeding also used it during pregnancy,” says </span><a href=\"https://victoryrejuvenationcenter.com/dr-genester-wilson-king/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Dr. Genester Wilson-King;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>Dr. Genester Wilson-King</span></a><span>, a Florida-based integrated health doctor, OB-GYN, and cannabis educator. “THC and the other cannabinoids in their active form are lipophilic, meaning they like fat, and breast milk is very fatty, so it accumulates in the breast milk.

As a new mom, she could feel those old symptoms of anxiety creeping back in and decided to use cannabis to treat them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Thompson says she consumed cannabis after delivering her baby to feel like herself again, so she took a 5-milligram edible (a relatively low dose) at home while her partner was there to support her. Her intention was simple: relieve the stress of trying to pump additional breast milk as a breastfeeding mama healing from a C-section.</span></p><p><span>While many of us are thirsty for more information on both the positive and negative effects of cannabis on our mental health, researchers are still scratching the surface. </span></p><p><span>While so many cannabis users discuss how weed has alleviated their anxiety and depression, some research, explained </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/30/health/marijuana-pros-and-cons-wellness/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:in a CNN piece;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>in a CNN piece</span></a><span>, has found that weed use can raise the risk “of an onset of a psychotic or mental health disorder, and using it after the onset of a mental condition worsened clinical outcomes.” It’s important for all of us to be aware of the spectrum of potential any drug has on our minds.

If people just took the time to listen to them speak about why they decided to consume, maybe they would learn a thing or two.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Ash, who delivered her baby at a birthing center with only the aid of midwives, successfully used weed for pain management during labor. She consumed cannabis again for her anxiety only a few short hours after giving birth. Ash tells me that today, cannabis helps her be an active mom who taps into her inner child so she can “be silly” with her baby.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Black moms exist at a unique intersection of race, gender and motherhood ― and many are discovering that cannabis can help them thrive and be present for motherhood’s precious moments while avoiding the harmful Black-mom stereotypes of being the loud and aggressive disciplinarian.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So what does a future look like where Black birthing people are respected, and perhaps begin their motherhood journey feeling supported and strong?</span></p><p><span>“It’s important for health care professionals to place value on whole person-centered care,” </span><a href=\"https://pacificcollege.edu/about/faculty/sandra-guynes\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Sandra Guynes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>Sandra Guynes</span></a><span>, a San Diego-based RN and cannabis educator, tells me. “Treating each person as an individual helps us identify any concerns before it’s too late [and] not allowing our biases to cloud our ability to provide personalized care that takes into consideration potential risks for sensitive populations.” </span></p><p><span>While physicians checking their biases and becoming more informed helps Black women feel more comfortable in medical environments, there’s still the issue of the legality of weed in the U.S.</span></p><p><span>Black people are disproportionately arrested for cannabis offenses (nearly four times more than white people) despite Black and white people consuming cannabis at “</span><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/gallery/marijuana-arrests-numbers\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:roughly equal rates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>roughly equal rates</span></a><span>.” The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) also found in a 2020 report that “in every state and in over 95% of counties with more than 30,000 people in which at least 1% of the residents are Black, Black people are arrested at higher rates than white people for marijuana possession.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Despite cannabis being legal for recreational adult use in 24 states and </span><a href=\"https://disa.com/marijuana-legality-by-state\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:decriminalized in 32 states;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>decriminalized in 32 states</span></a><span>, the national trends in racial disparities among </span><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/report/tale-two-countries-racially-targeted-arrests-era-marijuana-reform\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:weed possession arrests;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>weed possession arrests</span></a><span> have remained unchanged since 2010.

Black and brown parents have been historically unfairly targeted via the so-called war on drugs and, therefore, “are more likely to be tested for drug use, problematically sometimes without patient consent, and also more likely to have their children taken away if they are reported to the family regulation system commonly known as Children Protective Services.”</span></p><p><span>Wetterer criticizes this </span><span>protocol. “I do not think that anyone should be surveilled or criminalized or have their parenting drawn into question if they do decide to use cannabis.”</span></p><p><span>Black moms are also confronted by a deeply-rooted stigma against cannabis in their own communities. Systemic racism has broken down so many Black families by jailing parents for charges linked to weed that the fear of prison or loss of employment made weed a common enemy. But hopefully, the tide continues to shift.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Today, it’s evident from the incredible women in my community that Black moms understand that cannabis use is their right —&nbsp;and that the racist connotations assigned to certain drugs need to be dismantled. If the medical community begins to see cannabis as another drug that we should approach with hope and caution, we may be able to get far more use out of it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“It’s OK for moms to romanticize having a glass of wine at the end of the day, but for some reason, people think moms who consume cannabis are hotboxing their homes while rocking the baby to sleep,” King says. “There are so many ways to consume cannabis responsibly and still show up as a great parent.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Our children’s health is always paramount — and that’s a fact. But it’s become overwhelmingly evident, through my conversations with Black birthing cannabis enthusiasts, that showing up as a great parent every day means being your most authentic self. That requires remembering who you were before the baby was born and keeping that person alive, too. We can’t pour from an empty vessel, after all. And sometimes, to keep our vessel full, it needs the support of a one-hitter packed with ganja.</span></p><p><em>If you or someone you know needs help, call or text 988 or chat&nbsp;<a href=\"https://988lifeline.org/chat/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:988lifeline.org;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">988lifeline.org</a>&nbsp;for mental health support.
