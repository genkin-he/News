himself as the country mourned its worst mass killing.</p><p>Candles were lit and flowers were laid out in front of the cordoned off Campus Risbergska -- a school for young adults in Orebro -- as people passed by to pay their respect to the victims.</p><p>King Carl XVI Gustaf was to visit the town, the royal court announced as the country struggled to understand events.</p><p>Police did not immediately give details on the gunman or his motive. But they confirmed that 11 people, &quot;including the killer&quot;, had died in Tuesday&#39;s shooting spree in the town west of Stockholm. </p><p>Asked about reports that the gunman turned his gun on himself, Orebro police chief Roberto Eid Forest told reporters that &quot;there is a lot to indicate that&quot;.</p><p>Forest told a press conference the suspect was dead when police reached him.</p><p>Police were working to establish the reason for the killing spree and had not seen an indication of an &quot;ideological motive,&quot; he added. The suspect was not previously known to police.</p><p>- Six in hospital -</p><p>&quot;I can&#39;t say more about the suspected perpetrator, other than that he was obviously motivated and had access to firearms,&quot; Lars Wiren, area police chief, told AFP.</p><p>&quot;When the first police officers entered the building shots were fired, likely at the police, but no one of our staff is injured,&quot; Wiren added.</p><p>Police said not all the victims had been fully identified and have not disclosed any information about them, even whether they were students or teachers at the school.</p><p>They encouraged witnesses to contact them and to share videos of the shooting.</p><p>Health authorities said six people were being treated at Orebro&#39;s university hospital.</p><p>Three women and two men had undergone surgery for gunshot wounds and were in a &quot;stable but serious&quot; condition.</p><p>A woman was treated for minor injuries, Orebro County authorities said in a statement, adding that all the wounded were over the age of 18.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;This is the worst mass shooting in Swedish history,&quot; Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson told a press conference on Tuesday. He added that a lot of &quot;questions were still unanswered&quot;.</p><p>&quot;But there will come a time when we will know what happened, how it could happen and what motives may have been behind it,&quot; Kristersson said.</p><p>School attacks are rare in Sweden, but the country has suffered shootings and bombings linked to gang violence that kill dozens of people each year.</p><p>- &#39;Numb, speechless&#39; -</p><p>The TV4 television channel reported that police raided the suspected gunman&#39;s home in Orebro on Tuesday. It said the man was around 35 years old, was licensed to carry a weapon and had no criminal record. Reports have not identified him however.</p><p>The man lived reclusively, was unemployed, and had distanced himself from his family and friends, Aftonbladet newspaper reported, citing family members.</p><p>The attack was carried out about midday on Tuesday.</p><p>&quot;I saw some bodies lying on the ground. I don&#39;t know if they were dead or injured,&quot; 16-year-old Linn, who goes to school near the site of the massacre, told AFP.</p><p>&quot;There was blood everywhere, people were panicking and crying, parents were worried ... it was chaos,&quot; she added, her voice trembling.</p><p>Liv Demir, 36, whose son attends a school near Campus Risbergska, was shocked by events.</p><p>&quot;I became numb, speechless. I didn&#39;t really know where to go,&quot; she told AFP.</p><p>Her son has gym classes at Campus Risbergska. &quot;My thoughts were spiralling because I packed his sports bag in the morning,&quot; Demir said.</p><p>- &#39;Dark hour&#39; -</p><p>Sweden&#39;s Royal Court announced that flags would be &quot;flown at half-mast at all royal palaces&quot;. The government announced a similar measure for its offices and parliament.</p><p>European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen called the shooting &quot;truly horrifying&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Such violence and terror have no place in our societies -- least of all in schools. In this dark hour, we stand with the people of Sweden,&quot; she said in a post on X.</p><p>Though shootings are rare, Swedish schools have seen other violence in recent years.</p><p>In March 2022, an 18-year-old student stabbed two teachers to death at a secondary school in Malmo. Two months earlier, a 16-year-old was arrested after wounding another student and a teacher with a knife at a school in the small town of Kristianstad.</p><p>In October 2015, three people were killed in a racially motivated attack at a school in the western town of Trollhattan by a sword-wielding assailant who was killed by police.</p><p>bur-jll/nl/tw</p></div></article></div>",

(ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS)</figcaption></div></figure><p>President Donald Trump&#39;s shock proposal for the United States to take over the Gaza Strip and resettle its people faced a resounding rejection from Palestinians, Middle East leaders and governments elsewhere on Wednesday.</p><p>Trump made his announcement to audible gasps during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he was hosting at the White House for talks.</p><p>In a proposal that lacked details on how he would move out more than two million Palestinians or control Gaza, Trump said he would make the war-battered enclave &quot;unbelievable&quot; by removing unexploded bombs and rubble, and economically redeveloping it.</p><p>&quot;The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it, too. We&#39;ll own it,&quot; he said.</p><p>He said there was support from the &quot;highest leadership&quot; in the Middle East for his idea, but hours later, the leaders of Hamas, the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, Turkey, China, Britain, France and Germany hit back.</p><p>Netanyahu, however, welcomed the idea, saying it could &quot;change history&quot; and was worth &quot;paying attention to&quot;.</p><p>Suggesting &quot;long-term ownership&quot; by the United States, Trump said his idea would make it &quot;the Riviera of the Middle East. This could be something that could be so magnificent.&quot;</p><p>Hamas, which seized sole control of Gaza in 2007, rejected the proposal, branding it a&quot; racist&quot; idea.</p><p>In a statement, the group said Trump&#39;s proposal to &quot;occupy&quot; the territory was &quot;aggressive to our people and cause, won&#39;t serve stability in the region and will only put oil on the fire&quot;.</p><p>Much of Gaza was levelled in a 15-month war triggered by Hamas&#39;s October 2023 attack on Israel, and Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for sealing a ceasefire agreement that took effect last month.</p><p>- &#39;Miserable existence&#39; -</p><p>While Netanyahu&#39;s visit to the White House was billed to focus on a second phase of the truce, it quickly turned into the revelation of a proposal that would, if implemented, completely transform the Middle East.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Trump, who also floated travelling to Gaza, appeared to suggest it would not be rebuilt for Palestinians.</p><p>&quot;It should not go through a process of rebuilding and occupation by the same people that have... lived there and died there and lived a miserable existence there,&quot; he said.</p><p>Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas rejected the proposal, saying that &quot;legitimate Palestinian rights are not negotiable&quot; and that it would constitute a &quot;serious violation&quot; of international law.</p><p>It is not the first time that Trump has suggested Palestinians should move from Gaza. In recent days, he has cited Egypt and Jordan as possible destinations, but people from the territory have said they want to stay.</p><p>&quot;Trump thinks Gaza is a pile of garbage -- absolutely not,&quot; said 34-year-old Hatem Azzam, a resident of the territory.</p><p>For Palestinians, any attempts to force them out of Gaza would evoke dark memories of what the Arab world calls the &quot;Nakba&quot;, or catastrophe -- the mass displacement of Palestinians during Israel&#39;s creation in 1948.</p><p>Trump was vague on the details of how he would implement a takeover, but hinted that it could require US boots on the ground in one of the most volatile places on earth &quot;if necessary&quot;.</p><p>Egypt and Jordan have both rejected any resettlement from Gaza, with&nbsp;Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty calling on Wednesday for a swift reconstruction of the territory &quot;without the Palestinians leaving&quot;.</p><p>- &#39;Winning the war&#39; -</p><p>In Washington, meanwhile, Netanyahu hailed Trump as Israel&#39;s &quot;greatest friend&quot; and praised his &quot;willingness to think outside the box&quot;.</p><p>The Israeli premier would not rule out a return to hostilities with Hamas, or with its other foes in the region including Lebanon&#39;s Hezbollah and Iran.</p><p>&quot;We will end the war by winning the war,&quot; Netanyahu said, while vowing to secure the return of all hostages held by Hamas.</p><p>He did voice confidence that a deal with regional rival Saudi Arabia to normalise relations was &quot;going to happen&quot;.</p><p>But after Trump floated his proposal, Saudi Arabia said it would not formalise ties with Israel unless a Palestinian state is established.</p><p>&quot;The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also reaffirms its unequivocal rejection of any infringement on the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, whether through Israeli settlement policies, land annexation or attempts to displace the Palestinian people from their land,&quot; the foreign ministry said.</p><p>Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan also lashed out, saying that relocating Palestinians was something &quot;neither we nor the region can accept&quot;.</p><p>British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that Palestinians should be able to &quot;live and prosper&quot; in Gaza and the West Bank, while France said the future of Gaza must not involve &quot;control by a third state&quot;.</p><p>German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Gaza &quot;belongs to the Palestinians&quot;, while Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said: &quot;We are opposed to the forced transfer of the residents of Gaza.&quot;</p><p>The Gaza war began when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, resulting in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p><p>Israel&#39;s retaliatory response has killed at least 47,518 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory&#39;s health ministry. The United Nations considers the figures reliable.</p><p>burs-ser/kir</p></div></article></div>",

Atlaoui, 61, was to be driven from the Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport outside Paris to court and then on to jail, according to a source close to the case and the prosecutor&#39;s office in the nearby town of Bobigny.</p><p>Under an agreement last month between both countries for his transfer, Jakarta has left it to the French government to grant him either clemency, amnesty or a reduced sentence.</p><p>France abolished capital punishment in 1981.</p><p>A prosecutor in Bobigny would inform Atlaoui &quot;of his imprisonment in France in execution of his sentence&quot;, the public prosecutor&#39;s office there said before he landed.</p><p>He will then immediately be taken to prison, it added.</p><p>Atlaoui&#39;s lawyer Richard Sedillot has said he would work to have his client&#39;s sentence &quot;adapted&quot; so that the father of four could be released.</p><p>Atlaoui was arrested in 2005 at a factory in a Jakarta suburb where dozens of kilogrammes of drugs were discovered, with Indonesian authorities accusing him of being a &quot;chemist&quot;.</p><p>A welder from Metz in northeastern France, he has always denied being a drug trafficker, saying that he was installing machinery in what he thought was&nbsp;an acrylic factory.</p><p>Atlaoui had left Jakarta for Paris on Tuesday evening on board a KLM flight via Amsterdam.</p><p>His return was made possible after an agreement between French Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin and his Indonesian counterpart, Yusril Ihza Mahendra, on January 24.</p><p>In the agreement, Jakarta said it had decided not to execute Atlaoui and authorised his return on &quot;humanitarian grounds&quot; because he was ill.</p><p>Atlaoui was tight-lipped and wore a face mask at a news conference at Jakarta&#39;s main airport, after he was driven there in a black van from the capital&#39;s Salemba prison and handed over to French police officers.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button

cells and chemicals, a senior finance ministry official said, potentially leading to increased imports from the United States as global trade tensions grow.</p><p>The move, aimed at reducing average tariffs, comes ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#39;s visit to the U.S. next week.</p><p>In a bid to avoid President Donald Trump&#39;s growing tariff actions, India has already reduced average import tariff rates to 11% from 13% on several items in the latest budget.</p><p>The finance ministry official did not give the time period for the completion of the consultation process, but industry analysts say the process could take months.</p><p>Various Indian government departments, including those overseeing heavy industries and renewable energy, will soon consult local industry on reducing the Agriculture Infrastructure Development Cess (AIDC), Sanjay Agarwal, chairman of Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.</p><p>The AIDC is an alternative import tariff, collected by the Indian federal government for raising funds in a separate pool, and funds collected are used for building farm infrastructure.</p><p>Agarwal said the ministries would select items from this list for possible tariff reduction after industry consultations.</p><p>India has protected domestic industries such as autos, pharmaceuticals and farm sectors through state subsidies and high import tariffs, amid growing pressure to improve ties with the Trump administration.</p><p>The list includes 32 items such as luxury cars, solar cells, yachts, sports vessels, devices used in building semiconductors, and other machinery, all of which have seen the government impose AIDC tariff of between 6.5% and 70% on imports, after reducing the basic customs duties.</p><p>India&#39;s average import tariffs, including AIDC, are much higher than those of major trading partners including the United States, China and Japan, the official acknowledged.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;We can&#39;t take a giant step. We have to take baby steps,&quot; Agarwal said, referencing India&#39;s strategy of gradually reducing tariffs to temporarily protect domestic industries and boost their competitiveness.</p><p>TRADE BALANCE WITH THE U.S.</p><p>Referring to Trump&#39;s concerns about the high U.S. trade imbalance with India, Agarwal said average tariffs on goods imported from the United States, are relatively low, and imports, especially of crude oil and liquefied natural gas, could increase this year.</p><p>&quot;Duty is not an issue in the oil sector. One (Indian) rupee per metric ton is the rate of duty on import of crude,&quot; he said, suggesting that U.S. crude could become more attractive for India as supplies from Russia face increased sanctions.</p><p>India&#39;s trade surplus with the U.S., estimated at $35 billion in 2023/24, has been a highly contentious point following Trump&#39;s earlier threat of imposing tariffs over India&#39;s high levies.</p><p>India&#39;s crude oil and LNG imports from the U.S., estimated at about $6.5 billion in 2023/24 fiscal year ending March, out of a total $42 billion imports, could increase after the U.S. sanctions on Russia&#39;s oil companies and China&#39;s retaliatory tariffs on energy imports from the U.S., analysts said.</p><p>&quot;We got better prices from Russia. But the situation may change,&quot; Agarwal said adding the trade imbalance could be &quot;corrected.&quot;</p><p>India&#39;s top 30 import items from the U.S., such as oil products and diamonds, all fall within low tariff category, with rates ranging from 3% on airplanes to 7.5% on petrochemicals, he said, indicating items where imports could potentially increase.</p><p>(Reporting by Manoj Kumar and Nikunj Ohri; Editing by Kim Coghill)</p></div></article></div>",

United States.</p><p>Chinese e-commerce firms took a hit from news that the US Postal Service was suspending inbound parcels from China and Hong Kong, a move that followed tit-for-tat tariffs.</p><p>European markets also struggled, with carmakers and luxury industries suffering losses.</p><p>Tensions between the United States and China have soared in recent days as the world&#39;s two largest economies slapped a volley of import tariffs on each other.</p><p>Analysts noted that China&#39;s tariff response this week was relatively modest, providing some hope that a full-blown crisis could be avoided.</p><p>But &quot;the problem with trade wars is they can escalate quickly, leading to potential issues such as inflation, job losses and even recession&quot;, said Kate Marshall, lead investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.</p><p>Hong Kong&#39;s stock market closed down nearly one percent, with e-commerce giant JD.com sinking almost four percent and rival Alibaba also falling.</p><p>Shanghai dropped after it returned from a week-long break, while Tokyo reversed earlier losses.</p><p>Amid uncertainty, gold hit a fresh peak above $2,866 an ounce as investors rushed into the haven metal.</p><p>The tepid performance came despite a positive lead from Wall Street, after the United States delayed its 25 percent duties on imports from Canada and Mexico.</p><p>Tech firms were also under pressure after disappointing earnings led Google-parent Alphabet to sink 7.5 percent in after-hours trade in New York.</p><p>Chip-maker Advanced Micro Devices also sank in post-close business.</p><p>The tech sector has already been roiled by the unveiling of a new chatbot by Chinese startup DeepSeek, stoking concerns about the eye-watering investments made in AI in recent years.</p><p>In other company news, shares in Japan&#39;s Nissan fell around five percent following reports that the carmaker had decided to withdraw from merger talks with rival Honda.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Shares in Honda soared more than eight percent by the close.</p><p>British drugmaker GSK jumped more than five percent -- topping London&#39;s top-tier FTSE 100 index -- after it upgraded its sales outlook on strong cancer medicine sales, despite its net profit nearly halving.</p><p>Spanish banking giant Santander surged seven percent after it reported record annual profits for a third consecutive year.</p><p>On currency markets, the yen strengthened against the dollar also following data showing nominal wages in Japan rose far more than expected last month and at the fastest pace since 1997.</p><p>That firmed expectations the country&#39;s central bank would continue to hike interest rates this year.</p><p>By contrast, the Bank of England is widely forecast to cut borrowing costs Thursday.</p><p>- Key figures around 1100 GMT -</p><p>London - FTSE 100: FLAT at 8,573.05 points</p><p>Paris - CAC 40: DOWN 0.2 percent at 7,890.15</p><p>Frankfurt - DAX: DOWN

wake of Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p><p>Despite pressure from climate campaigners for the industry to phase out fossil fuels, companies are reducing investment in renewables and boosting their more profitable oil and gas output.</p><p>TotalEnergies said Wednesday it would reduce its investments in low-carbon energy, mainly for electricity, by $500 million -- from $5 billion to $4.5 billion.</p><p>The French oil and gas major reported a net profit of $15.8 billion for 2024 -- still sizeable but 26 percent lower than in the previous year. It was around $1 billion less than forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg and financial data firm FactSet.</p><p>This followed two years of record profits, which reached $21.4 billion in 2023.</p><p>&quot;The oil and gas landscape was less favourable (in 2024),&quot; TotalEnergies chief executive Patrick Poyanne told reporters.</p><p>&quot;In the end, it will still be the third highest results in (company) history,&quot; he added.</p><p>Equinor said its net profit fell by a quarter to $8.8 billion in 2024.</p><p>The Norwegian company said it now planned a renewable capacity of between 10 and 12 gigawatts in 2030, down from a previous forecast of 12 to 16 GW.</p><p>It added that its ambition to allocate 50 percent of capital investment to renewable and low-carbon projects &quot;is retired&quot;.</p><p>Emissions from fossil fuels keep rising despite a global pledge to move the world away from coal, oil and gas.</p><p>Under the Paris accord on climate change, the world agreed to try and keep warming to this safer 1.5C threshold.</p><p>- &#39;Colossal profits&#39; -</p><p>Equinor also announced plans to increase oil and gas production by more than 10 percent between 2024 and 2027.

nationwide last year.</p><p>Pakistan and neighbouring Afghanistan are the only countries where polio is endemic, and militants have for decades targeted vaccination teams and their security escorts.</p><p>A police officer guarding polio vaccinators in the northwest was shot dead by militants on Monday, the first day of the annual campaign that is due to last a week.</p><p>In Kashmir, health worker Manzoor Ahmad trudged up snowy mountains as temperatures dipped to minus six degrees Celsius (21 degrees Fahrenheit) to administer polio vaccinations in the region.</p><p>&quot;It is a mountainous, hard area...&nbsp;we arrive here for polio vaccination despite the three feet of snowfall,&quot; Ahmad, who heads the polio campaign in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, told AFP.</p><p>- Huge risk -</p><p>Social worker Mehnaz, who goes by one name and has been helping the vaccinators since 2018, said the difficult climate poses a huge risk to the vaccination teams.</p><p>&quot;We have no monthly salary... we come here to give polio shots to the children despite the glaciers and avalanches,&quot; she told AFP.</p><p>&quot;We risk our lives and leave our children at home.&quot;</p><p>The challenge is larger this year for the country with a population of 240 million, after it recorded at least 73 polio cases in 2024 -- a sharp increase from just six cases the year before.</p><p>Health workers aim to vaccinate approximately 1,700 children within a week in the town of Surgan, around 150 kilometres (90 miles) north of Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir.</p><p>&quot;Our target is to give polio shots to 750,000 children below the age of five. There are 4,000 polio teams that visit house-to-house,&quot; Ahmad said.</p><p>&quot;There have been no polio cases in Kashmir for the last 24 years,&quot; he added with pride.</p><p>Polio can easily be prevented by an oral vaccine, but in the past some Islamic religious leaders have falsely claimed that the vaccine contains pork or alcohol, declaring it forbidden for Muslims to consume.</p><p>str-stm/dhw/fox</p></div></article></div>",

submitted for the former democracy leader&#39;s home -- the third time the sale has flopped.</p><p>The two-storey Yangon house, on about 0.8 hectares (1.9 acres) of land, was put up for sale with a minimum price of $140 million following a lengthy legal wrangle over the property between the Nobel laureate and her brother.</p><p>Suu Kyi, who spent years under house arrest at the mansion under a former junta, has been detained since the military seized power once again in February 2021.</p><p>Around a dozen journalists, watched over by security personnel in plain clothes, attended the kerbside sale run by junta-appointed officials outside the colonial-era house on leafy University Avenue, a few doors from the US embassy.</p><p>After calling for bids starting from 297 billion kyats -- around $140 million at the official exchange rate -- and getting no response, the auctioneer called off the sale, AFP reporters at the scene saw.</p><p>&quot;I announce the auction is not successful after calling for bids three times,&quot; the auctioneer said.</p><p>The sale is being run by junta-appointed officials on behalf of Suu Kyi&#39;s estranged brother Aung San Oo, who won a court ruling granting him ownership of half of the property.</p><p>Aung San Oo, who has lived outside Myanmar for decades, agreed the minimum sale price with the junta, which has run two previous unsuccessful auctions, in March and August last year.</p><p>With Myanmar&#39;s economy shattered by the civil war triggered by the military coup, it is unclear who in the country would be in a position to spend $140 million on a single, increasingly dilapidated property.</p><p>Real estate agents say similar-sized properties in upmarket Yangon areas might fetch $1 million to $2 million.</p><p>The house holds a special place in Myanmar history -- Suu Kyi was confined within its crumbling walls for around 15 years after shooting to fame during huge demonstrations against the then-junta in 1988.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Cut off from her husband and children in England, Suu Kyi spent time playing the piano, reading detective novels and meditating as her status as a democracy leader grew.</p><p>Hundreds of people would regularly gather on the pavement outside to hear her talk about&nbsp;democracy and fighting military rule through non-violence.</p><p>After her release in 2010 she continued living at the villa, receiving a string of foreign leaders -- including then US president Barack Obama, journalists and diplomats.</p><p>Suu Kyi, 79, is serving a 27-year prison sentence on charges ranging from corruption to not respecting Covid-19 pandemic restrictions -- charges rights groups say are a junta sham designed to eliminate her politically.</p><p>bur-pdw/fox</p></div></article></div>",
