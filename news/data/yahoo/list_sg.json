SOTHY)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Wild monkeys egged on by YouTubers have been rampaging at Cambodia&#39;s famed Angkor Wat complex, attacking tourists, wrecking temple stonework and damaging information boards, officials said Wednesday.</p><p>The agency that runs the UNESCO-listed site warned visitors to steer clear of the growing gangs of &quot;aggressive&quot; macaques that live around the sprawling complex of ruins and have been biting tourists.</p><p>The macaques are native to the lush forests that surround Angkor Wat, but Apsara National Authority said human interaction -- particularly by people filming content to post online -- had changed their behaviour.</p><p>A small number of YouTubers regularly fed monkeys to create videos and this has &quot;changed the monkeys&#39; natural behaviour from being wild animals to domestic ones that are aggressive, steal foods, and cause injuries among people&quot;, it said in a statement.</p><p>Some have reportedly even filmed themselves abusing macaques.</p><p>Long Kosal, a spokesman for the Apsara National Authority, told AFP that as well as the danger posed to tourists, the agency was increasingly worried about the monkeys damaging the centuries-old stonework.</p><p>&quot;On top of biting visitors, they have been climbing up and pushing stones down, damaging temples,&quot; he said, adding that the macaques had also damaged information boards.</p><p>The agency has urged tourists to leave the monkeys alone while visiting the ruins, and said it is looking for &quot;an appropriate solution&quot; to the problem.</p><p>Angkor Wat, built from the 9th to the 15th centuries, was the capital of the Khmer Empire and is Cambodia&#39;s top tourist attraction, bringing in valuable revenue to a poor country.</p><p>More than a million foreign tourists visited the park last year.</p><p>Since it became a world heritage site in 1992, Angkor Wat and the surrounding jungle have benefited from increased legal and physical protections.</p><p>There are hopes that wildlife sightings will also spark interest in local and foreign tourists and boost conservation education efforts.</p><p>Last year, the agricultural ministry announced a plan to conduct a census of monkeys in public areas and to identify and relocate those posing a danger to humans.</p><p>suy/pdw/dhw</p></div></article></div>",

A password is actually “one of the cybersecurity choices users have real control over,”&nbsp;explained Aaron Pritz, CEO of cybersecurity firm Reveal Risk.</p><p>To make more secure choices, HuffPost asked cybersecurity experts about the password rules they personally follow. Read on for their lessons:</p><h2><strong>1. They use password managers.&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Every data security expert HuffPost talked with uses a password manager and advises people to use one too.</p><p>Instead of writing your passwords down somewhere you might lose and a criminal might find, a password manager does the work of generating and remembering unique, strong passwords for you.</p><p>“Your password manager is logged in on your phone or on your computer, and you’re letting it create the password. So it might put a 32-character password in there. It puts that password in your vault,” explained Aaron Pritz, CEO of cybersecurity firm Reveal Risk. This way, “you don’t even have to remember the password, which is kind of nice.”</p><p>“It reduces your cognitive load to remembering one master password,” said Kamide.</p><p>Maril Vernon, a security architect and certified&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bootcamp.du.edu/blog/the-complete-guide-to-ethical-hacking/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:ethical hacker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">ethical hacker</a>, said that even in the event that a password manager company itself got hacked, this is not as bad as other breaches, “because the password manager company doesn’t actually store your master password to unlock your vault.”</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>In other words, even if a criminal downloaded a copy of your password manager vault, they cannot see your passwords because only you have the master password.</p><h2><strong>2. They use multi-factor authentication.&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Many passwords will also give you the option to turn on “two-factor authentication” and you should always select this feature, experts said.</p><p>A multi-factor authentication that requires a texted or emailed code to login is your final failsafe in case your password manager is breached.</p><p>“When I use a password manager, I have a master password, and I also have authentication code that I use through an authenticator that changes basically like every minute,” Kamide said. This way, you’re “massively reducing the probability” that somebody is going to guess your password, he said.</p><h2><strong>3. They never reuse passwords.&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>“If a website gets breached, criminals will sell your account details to other criminals or use those login details on other sites,” Pritz warned.</p><p>And no, just tacking on a new number to your same password does not change your password enough.</p><p>“I recently saw some exposed company accounts and passwords publicly available on a criminal leak site for a company we were helping. I could quickly see that ‘John’ used his wife’s name and a sequential number that he would increase by one each time he had to reset it, on all his passwords,” Pritz said.</p><p>“Since he was using the same password across sites, one could get into his bank account or other important accounts very quickly,” he added.</p><h2><strong>4. They do use sentence-long, complex passwords.</strong></h2><p>“Please use a password manager. If not, please use really, really long passwords over complex passwords with random characters,” Vernon advised.</p><p>That’s because the longer your password is, the harder it is for computers to figure it out.</p><p>One cybersecurity firm <a href=\"https://tech.co/password-managers/how-long-hacker-crack-password\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:estimated;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">estimated</a> it could solve a seven-character password in just two seconds even when the password had numbers, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters, but a 12-character password with numbers, upper- and lowercase letters would take six years to solve.</p><p>“Length is key, and if you need extra length, numbers and random characters will help you,” Vernon said. “But the problem is, people use commonly available numbers like ‘2025.’”</p><p>So do pad your passwords with more characters, but do not use commonly used answers like current years or birthdates.</p><p>Just how long should a password be?&nbsp;Vernon said a long password should be at minimum 16 characters to safeguard against potential hacks, and her own passwords are at least 44 characters, because it would take even the most advanced AI hundreds of years to crack that password.</p><p>That’s why security experts recommend choosing a sentence as a way to make your password longer. Kamide gave the example of using your favorite Taylor Swift lyrics, as one example, and then adding numbers to make it more complex.</p><p>You can also simply choose groups of random words, because this type of combination is much harder for a cyber criminal to crack, Vernon said.</p><p>In other words, do not just pick multiple cities or related foods as your password combination. “If you do something like ‘correct-horse-battery-parakeet’ ― those words are not associated, so it’s much harder to dictionary-attack them,” she said.</p><p>Ultimately, setting up a secure password can take more time, but what you decide can be the difference between a hacked bank account and a frantic call to your credit card company, and your peace of mind. Choose wisely.</p><h3>Related...</h3><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/spoofing-scam-url-emails_n_66cc97e8e4b09c9ffeaf1006\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Are You Being &#39;Spoofed&#39;?

and environmental risks, Washington-based global security nonprofit C4ADS has said in a report.</p><p>According to the report, Indonesia&#39;s 8 million metric ton refining capacity was distributed

policies against trade with China, the report said. Nickel is a key battery component.</p><p>Indonesia&#39;s mining ministry did not immediately comment.</p><p>An Indonesian official said last year that Chinese companies were approaching Indonesian and South Korean firms for potential partnerships to reduce their stakes in smelters and make their product more accessible to the U.S. market.</p><p>President Prabowo Subianto formed a task force to develop the downstream mineral industry with domestic financing to &quot;gradually reduce perception that foreigners got the most benefits,&quot; Mining Minister Bahlil Lahadalia said last month.</p><p>The C4ADS report found that two Chinese companies, Tsingshan Holding Group and Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry Co Ltd, accounted for more than 70% of Indonesia&#39;s refining capacity as of 2023.</p><p>The two were among the earliest investors when Indonesia started a push for domestic processing of nickel ore - a move that has made it the world&#39;s dominant producer.</p><p>Last year, a court in Central Sulawesi sentenced two workers at Indonesia Tsingshan Stainless Steel to seven months jail for negligence that led to a fire and deaths at a Tsingshan facility in December 2023.

Tuesday aged 88, leaving millions of followers in mourning across the world.</p><p>Prince Karim al-Husseini was regarded as a direct descendent of the Prophet Mohammed, given nearly divine-status as the 49th hereditary imam of the Ismaili sect of Shia Islam.</p><p>The Swiss-born philanthropist was bequeathed the title of Aga Khan aged 20 by his grandfather, who skipped the line of succession for the first time since the seventh century to appoint a &quot;young man&quot; of the &quot;new age&quot;.</p><p>He was the son of a British socialite and a playboy ambassador for Pakistan, who became known for having a string of high-profile lovers that landed him in the diary columns of glossy magazines.</p><p>The Aga Khan went on to have a jetset lifestyle himself marked by private planes, yachts, skiing in the Winter Olympics, and a marriage to a British model, with whom he had three children.</p><p>They later divorced and he married German singer Gabriele Thyssen, with whom he had a son.</p><p>During the divorce case, French judges had difficulty estimating the Aga Khan&#39;s wealth, because of a rare fiscal privilege that allows him to pay taxes in Switzerland, despite living in France.</p><p>- Leave a &#39;better world&#39; -</p><p>Fuelled by his enormous wealth, he launched an apolitical secular development foundation in 1967 credited with raising literacy levels in 18 countries across South and Central Asia, Africa and the Middle East.</p><p>Its work in Pakistan earned the Aga Khan the wrath of Sunni Taliban militants who accused the foundation&#39;s schools of &quot;brainwashing&quot; men and women to stay away from Islam.</p><p>In his youth he had dreamed of becoming an architect, before graduating instead from Harvard University with a degree in Islamic history.</p><p>He has also pursued a goal of educating the world about the richness of Muslim culture.</p><p>&quot;I was born with Islamic ethics in a Muslim family. There is nothing wrong with being well off as long as money has a social and ethical value and is not the object of one&#39;s own greed,&quot; he told AFP in 2008.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;One of the principles of Islam is that on his deathbed every person must try to leave behind a better world.&quot;</p><p>The Aga Khan has among other things helped finance the reconstruction of Bosnia&#39;s Ottoman-era Mostar bridge, which was destroyed during the Balkan Wars in the 1990s.</p><p>He boasts a enviable collection of over 1,000 years of Islamic art, one of the world&#39;s largest and most valuable, that he has put on display in his cultural centres in London, Lisbon, Vancouver and Dubai.</p><p>&quot;We don&#39;t do enough to illustrate to the peoples of our world the greatness of Islamic civilisations,&quot; he told AFP in an interview in 2008 in Syria, after funding the restoration of Aleppo&#39;s majestic citadel.</p><p>- Racing empire -</p><p>Just three years after taking on his religious responsibilities, he acquired a racehorsing empire assiduously built up by his grandfather and his father.</p><p>&quot;The idea of entering into an activity that was in no way central to the Ismaili Imamat, an activity in which no member of my family -- neither my brother nor my sister nor I -- had any understanding, in itself raised a major question mark,&quot; he said in a book published in 2011 celebrating 50 years in the racehorse business.</p><p>He will be, in the public&#39;s eye, forever best remembered for the ill-fated Shergar, who clinched a mind-bogglingly easy win at the 1981 Epson Derby.</p><p>John Matthias, the jockey of the second horse Glint of Gold, actually believed he had won the race because he couldn&#39;t see the winner.</p><p>Shergar was kidnapped two years later from the Aga Khan&#39;s Ballymany Stud in Ireland.</p><p>In March 2016, the Ismaili spiritual leader, then aged 79, fell for an audacious scammer who tricked rich targets out of millions of euros by impersonating one of France&#39;s top politicians.</p><p>His Aga Khan Development Network made bank transfers totalling 20 million euros to accounts in France, Poland and China.

gunman -- were killed at an education centre in the city of Orebro, with many questions still unanswered.</p><p>Several media reported the suspected gunman turned his gun on himself -- but police would not confirm those reports.</p><p>&quot;Eleven people are dead, including the killer,&quot; police told AFP about Tuesday&#39;s massacre at Campus Risbergska, a secondary school for young adults.</p><p>Police did not comment on the number of wounded nor how serious those were but the southern Orebro region said on Tuesday that six people suffering from gunshot wounds were taken to hospital.</p><p>&quot;This is the worst mass shooting in Swedish history,&quot; Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson told a press conference late on Tuesday.</p><p>Kristersson noted a lot of &quot;questions were still unanswered&quot;.</p><p>&quot;But there will come a time when we will know what happened, how it could happen and what motives may have been behind it,&quot; Kristersson said, urging people not to &quot;speculate&quot;.</p><p>&quot;The motive for the shooting is not yet known, but all the indications are that the perpetrator acted alone, without ideological motive,&quot; Orebro police said in a statement.</p><p>Police have not disclosed any information about the identity or ages of the dead, nor whether they were students or teachers at the school.</p><p>School attacks are relatively rare in Sweden, but the country has suffered shootings and bombings linked to gang violence that kill dozens of people each year.</p><p>&quot;The perpetrator is not known to the police, he has no gang affiliations, we believe there will be no further attacks,&quot; Orebro police chief Roberto Eid Forest told reporters on Tuesday evening.</p><p>- &#39;Blood everywhere&#39;

around here when I saw some bodies lying on the ground. I don&#39;t know if they were dead or injured,&quot; 16-year-old Linn, who goes to school near the site of the massacre, told an AFP correspondent at the scene.</p><p>&quot;There was blood everywhere, people were panicking and crying, parents were worried... it was chaos,&quot; she added, her voice trembling.</p><p>Two Campus Risbergska teachers, Miriam Jarlevall and Patrik Soderman, told newspaper Dagens Nyheter they heard gunfire in a hallway.</p><p>&quot;Students came and said someone was shooting. Then we heard more shooting in the hallway. We didn&#39;t go out, we hid in our offices,&quot; they said.</p><p>&quot;There were a lot of gunshots at first and then it was quiet for a half-hour and then it started again. We were lying under our desks, cowering.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;Dark hour&#39; -</p><p>Sweden&#39;s King Carl XVI Gustaf said in a statement that he had received the news of the shooting with &quot;sadness and dismay&quot;.</p><p>European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen described the event as &quot;truly horrifying&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Such violence and terror have no place in our societies -- least of all in schools. In this dark hour, we stand with the people of Sweden,&quot; she said in a post on X.</p><p>Though such shootings are rare, several other violent incidents have struck Swedish schools in recent years.</p><p>In March 2022, an 18-year-old student stabbed two teachers to death at a secondary school in the southern city of Malmo.</p><p>Two months earlier, a 16-year-old was arrested after wounding another student and a teacher with a knife at a school in the small town of Kristianstad.</p><p>In October 2015, three people were killed in a racially motivated attack at a school in the western town of Trollhattan by a sword-wielding assailant who was later killed by police.</p><p>bur-ef/jll/bc</p></div></article></div>",

(Idrees MOHAMMED)</figcaption></div></figure><p>India&#39;s Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a ritual river dip on Wednesday at the world&#39;s largest religious festival, a week after a stampede killed at least 30 pilgrims.</p><p>Many millions of people have already bathed in the confluence of rivers at the Kumbh Mela, a six-week-long Hindu celebration of prayer and bathing held every 12 years.</p><p>Modi, dressed in a saffron-coloured top and counting prayer beads in his hands, waded out thigh-deep to the holiest site of the Sangam, the meeting point of the Ganges, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati rivers.</p><p>He then dunked his head under the waters several times, watched by vast crowds packed along the river banks in the&nbsp;north Indian city of Prayagraj, in Utter Pradesh state.</p><p>Modi said he was &quot;blessed&quot; to take part, calling it a &quot;moment of divine connection&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Like the tens of millions of others who have taken part in it, I was also filled with a spirit of devotion,&quot; he added in a statement.</p><p>Hindus believe that those who immerse themselves in the waters cleanse themselves of sin, breaking free from the cycle of rebirth and ultimately attaining salvation.</p><p>Organisers say the scale of the Kumbh Mela is that of a temporary country, boasting that as many as 400 million pilgrims are expected to attend.</p><p>Last month, at least 30 people were killed and many more injured after a surging crowd spilt out of a police cordon and trampled bystanders.</p><p>More than 380 million people have so far taken a dip in the rivers during the festival, which began last month and runs until February 26, according to state government figures.</p><p>Modi was accompanied by Yogi Adityanath, a hardline Hindu monk and Uttar Pradesh state chief minister, a key figure in the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).</p><p>Yogi&#39;s successful management of the mega event was seen as a critical test for the 52-year-old firebrand leader, viewed as a potential eventual successor to Modi, 74.</p><p>But the deadly stampede on January 29 took the sheen off Yogi and his government&#39;s claims touting the stellar management of the event promoted on billboards across the city.</p><p>Modi&#39;s visit to the Kumbh coincides with state elections in the capital New Delhi, where the BJP is the main challenger to the incumbent Aam Aadmi Party, led by charismatic Arvind Kejriwal.</p><p>bb/pjm/dhw</p></div></article></div>",
