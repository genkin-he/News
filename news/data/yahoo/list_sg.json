with some reports saying the move could spell the end of their merger talks.</p><p>The companies agreed in December to launch discussions on joining forces to create the world&#39;s third largest automaker, seen as a bid to catch up with Tesla and Chinese electric vehicle firms.</p><p>Honda&#39;s CEO insisted at the time it was not a bailout for Nissan, which last year announced thousands of job cuts after reporting a 93 percent plunge in first-half net profit.</p><p>Japanese public broadcaster NHK and other media outlets reported Tuesday that Honda was offering to acquire Nissan shares and make it a subsidiary, instead of the previous plan to integrate under a new holding company.</p><p>But the proposal is expected to face fierce opposition from Nissan over concerns over its autonomy, the reports said.</p><p>Honda shares jumped more than four percent in morning trading on Wednesday. Nissan shares were also up more than four percent.</p><p>A Honda spokeswoman told AFP there had been no official announcement and declined to comment further. Nissan was not immediately available for comment.</p><p>The Asahi newspaper said both companies would soon hold separate board meetings to discuss issues including the possibility of calling off the talks.</p><p>The Yomiuri daily cited an unnamed Nissan executive as saying the merger was now &quot;almost impossible&quot;, with difficulties satisfying shareholders on either side.</p><p>Lacklustre consumer spending and stiff competition in several markets are making life hard for many automakers.</p><p>Business has been especially tough for foreign brands in China, where electric vehicle manufacturers such as BYD are leading the way as demand grows for less polluting vehicles.</p><p>Honda and Nissan are Japan&#39;s number two and three automakers after Toyota.</p><p>They already agreed last year to explore a partnership on EV software and components among other technologies, an initiative joined by Mitsubishi Motors in August.</p><p>But the smaller automaker&#39;s chief said this week that it will make a final decision on whether to join the Honda-Nissan merger talks in mid-February or later.</p><p>kh-kaf/sco</p></div></article></div>",

Here are some details about three of them. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) declined to comment.</p><p>GAVIN KLIGER</p><p>Gavin Kliger, who lists his job on Linkedin as “Special Advisor to the Director @ OPM” since January, graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 2020 with a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and boasting a 3.95 grade point average, according to the platform.</p><p>Kliger, pictured donning a &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; hat on his profile page on social media platform X, was most recently a senior Software Engineer at San Francisco, California-based AI Startup Databrinks and served in a similar role at Twitter in 2019, his Linkedin Profile shows.</p><p>His Substack features essays entitled “the Curious Case of Matt Gaetz: How the Deep State Destroys its Enemies” in which he describes Gaetz as “a congressman who was never charged with a crime... forced from office through the coordinated efforts of the intelligence community, the DOJ, establishment Republicans, and a media complex more interested in headlines than truth,&quot; a scenario that echoes Trump&#39;s own trevails, he claims.</p><p>Another essay, called “Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense: The Warrior Washington Fears,” argues the controversial appointee represents “a direct challenge to the entrenched power brokers who have spent decades turning the Pentagon into a revolving door for defense contractors and corporate lobbyists.”</p><p>A third essay, titled &quot;Why DOGE&quot; with the subtitle &quot;Why I gave up a seven-figure salary to save America&quot; is available only to paid subscribers.</p><p>Kliger did not respond to a request for comment, but reposted an Elon Musk post on X on Feb 3, saying &quot;Time to confess: Media reports saying that @DOGE has some of world’s best software engineers are in fact true.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Musk head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) project.</p><p>LUKE FARRITOR</p><p>Luke Farritor is a former intern at SpaceX, Musk’s space company, where he worked 10 hour days writing software for the pumps, valves and other components that help fuel rockets, according to an article posted on the website of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where Farritor studied computer science.</p><p>Farritor was part of an award-winning team that deciphered portions of an ancient Greek scroll, a Linkedin Post shows. He is also a Thiel Fellow, last year winning $100,000 and access to a network of tech founders, investors, scientists, and former fellows to focus on his Greek scroll project.</p><p>According to the New York Times, Farritor, was among the workers given access to USAID systems. He is also listed as an “executive engineer” in the office of the secretary of health and human services, and had an email account at the General Services Administration (GSA), the paper reported. The GSA is a federal government agency that manages federal property and provides contracting services.</p><p>Musk’s aides, including Farritor, have requested access to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services systems that control contracts and the more than $1 trillion in payments that go out annually, according to the Times.</p><p>Farritor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>EDWARD CORISTINE</p><p>According to Wired magazine, Edward Coristine appears to have recently graduated from high school and to have been enrolled at Northeastern University. He also spent three months at Neuralink, Musk’s brain-computer interface company, last summer, the magazine added.</p><p>Coristine is listed in internal OPM records as an &quot;expert&quot; at OPM, Wired reported.</p><p>A Connecticut registry of businesses shows that an Edward Coristine created three tech or computer-related firms that list as a principle place of business a New Canaan, Connecticut home, valued by Zillow at over $2.4 million. One of them, Tesla.Sexy LLC, dedicated to &quot;Professional, Scientific and Technological services,&quot; appears to still be in operation.</p><p>Web-based platform Github, which allows developers to store, share and collaborate on code, shows an Eduard C as the only &quot;member&quot; of Diamond CDN -- one of the now dissolved Connecticut-based companies founded by Coristine. The same Eduard C, who describes himself as a technologist who is &quot;passionate about improving humanity!&quot; has contributed to Neuralink&#39;s code base, according to the platform.</p><p>Coristine did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>(Reporting by Alexandra Alper; Editing by Michael Perry)</p></div></article></div>",

each trade secrets charge carries a maximum 10-year term and $250,000 fine.</p><p>The defendant, also known as Leon Ding, was indicted last March on four counts of theft of trade secrets. He is free on bond. Lawyers for Ding did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Ding&#39;s case was coordinated through an interagency Disruptive Technology Strike Force created in 2023 by the Biden administration.</p><p>The initiative was designed to help stop advanced technology from being acquired by countries such as China and Russia, or potentially threatening national security.</p><p>Prosecutors said Ding stole information about the hardware infrastructure and software platform that lets Google&#39;s supercomputing data centers train large AI models.</p><p>Some of the allegedly stolen chip blueprints were meant to give Google an edge over cloud computing rivals Amazon.com and Microsoft, which design their own, and reduce Google&#39;s reliance on chips from Nvidia.</p><p>Prosecutors said Ding joined Google in May 2019 and began his thefts three years later, when he was being courted to join an early-stage Chinese technology company.</p><p>Ding allegedly uploaded more than 1,000 confidential files by May 2023 and later circulated a PowerPoint presentation to employees of a China startup he founded, saying that country&#39;s policies encouraged development of a domestic AI industry.</p><p>Google was not charged and has said it cooperated with law enforcement.</p><p>According to court records describing a Dec. 18 hearing, prosecutors and defense lawyers discussed a &quot;potential resolution&quot; to Ding&#39;s case, &quot;but anticipate the matter proceeding to trial.&quot;</p><p>The case is U.S. v. Ding, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 24-cr-00141.</p><p>(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)</p></div></article></div>",

around mothers who use cannabis was beginning to dissolve.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>To my dismay, however, the images of this cannabis-based alternative parenting lifestyle did not include anyone who looked like me. Of course, it was suddenly OK (and even liberating) to consume weed as a mom — as long </span><a href=\"https://hightimes.com/culture/the-unbearable-whiteness-of-the-marijuana-moms/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:as you’re white;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>as you’re white</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>It appears that the </span><a href=\"https://graphics.aclu.org/marijuana-arrest-report/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:racial stigma of cannabis use;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>racial stigma of cannabis use</span></a><span> permeates every single social demographic. To disrupt that as best as I could, I created Blunt Blowin’ Mama, an online cannabis lifestyle community that aims to normalize conversations around weed use by Black and brown mothers while highlighting the BIWOC impacting change.</span><span>I have spoken to hundreds of women since launching the platform, and they’ve collectively imparted one major takeaway: Moms who use cannabis do so because they believe it makes them better humans and better parents. And Black women deserve that option, too.</span></p><p><span>While there’s a growing discourse amongst new mothers (</span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science/23732852/weed-pregnancy-prenatal-marijuana-cannabis-safety-state-policies\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:and everyone else;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>and everyone else</span></a><span>) about consuming cannabis during pregnancy, most medical experts do not recommend it. Many Black moms, such as myself, are focused instead on the potential postpartum benefits. This is a gray area I had to explore by speaking with mothers from my community about their experiences with cannabis, as well as experts (of all races) about the plant’s effects — and racial bias within the medical system.</span></p><p><span>The most salient concern about women who use weed after they’ve given birth is the chance of harming the baby through breast milk. And researchers are just now starting to examine that “chance.” As of now, there isn’t enough data to certainly predict, for example, when it would be safe to breastfeed again after smoking, vaping, or ingesting cannabis, says </span><a href=\"https://nayacare.org/about-nayacare/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Dr. Sonal Patel;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>Dr. Sonal Patel</span></a><span>, a Denver-based pediatrician and postpartum maternal health care specialist at NayaCare Clinic.</span></p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p><span>While she advises that “cannabis should be avoided after birth and as long as you are planning to breastfeed,” Patel encourages mamas to have an open dialogue with their physician about the subject of weed use. And if a parent feels their care provider is judging them regarding cannabis, they should swiftly find another.</span></p><p><span>The lack of empirical data on postpartum weed use was the overarching concern of all the experts I spoke to (think about how challenging, ethically, it is to launch medical studies on cannabis and breastfeeding). “There is very limited research about cannabis while breastfeeding. Because we don’t know the long-term effects on birthing people and their infants, I agree with major organizations such as ACOG, CDC, and AAP who recommend against the use of marijuana if breastfeeding,” says </span><a href=\"https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/profile/elizabeth-wetterer\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Dr. Libby Wetterer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>Dr. Libby Wetterer</span></a><span>, assistant professor and fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health at UPenn’s Health System.</span></p><p><span>As the CDC reminds us, the data on how cannabis can affect a child through breast milk is both </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/vaccinations-medications-drugs/marijuana.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:under-researched and conflicting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>under-researched and conflicting</span></a><span> —&nbsp;therefore, seen as a sizable risk. “It’s difficult to assess the harms of using cannabis while breastfeeding because most patients that use cannabis while breastfeeding also used it during pregnancy,” says </span><a href=\"https://victoryrejuvenationcenter.com/dr-genester-wilson-king/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Dr. Genester Wilson-King;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>Dr. Genester Wilson-King</span></a><span>, a Florida-based integrated health doctor, OB-GYN, and cannabis educator. “THC and the other cannabinoids in their active form are lipophilic, meaning they like fat, and breast milk is very fatty, so it accumulates in the breast milk.

Cannabis became an incredibly helpful mental health tool for me. On the nights when I actually found sleep (my insomnia was raging), I slept with a kitchen knife in the second drawer of my nightstand in case I decided life was too much.</span></p><p><span>I had trouble shedding over 30 pounds of pregnancy weight during this time.

If people just took the time to listen to them speak about why they decided to consume, maybe they would learn a thing or two.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Ash, who delivered her baby at a birthing center with only the aid of midwives, successfully used weed for pain management during labor. She consumed cannabis again for her anxiety only a few short hours after giving birth. Ash tells me that today, cannabis helps her be an active mom who taps into her inner child so she can “be silly” with her baby.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Black moms exist at a unique intersection of race, gender and motherhood ― and many are discovering that cannabis can help them thrive and be present for motherhood’s precious moments while avoiding the harmful Black-mom stereotypes of being the loud and aggressive disciplinarian.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So what does a future look like where Black birthing people are respected, and perhaps begin their motherhood journey feeling supported and strong?</span></p><p><span>“It’s important for health care professionals to place value on whole person-centered care,” </span><a href=\"https://pacificcollege.edu/about/faculty/sandra-guynes\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Sandra Guynes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>Sandra Guynes</span></a><span>, a San Diego-based RN and cannabis educator, tells me. “Treating each person as an individual helps us identify any concerns before it’s too late [and] not allowing our biases to cloud our ability to provide personalized care that takes into consideration potential risks for sensitive populations.” </span></p><p><span>While physicians checking their biases and becoming more informed helps Black women feel more comfortable in medical environments, there’s still the issue of the legality of weed in the U.S.</span></p><p><span>Black people are disproportionately arrested for cannabis offenses (nearly four times more than white people) despite Black and white people consuming cannabis at “</span><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/gallery/marijuana-arrests-numbers\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:roughly equal rates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>roughly equal rates</span></a><span>.” The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) also found in a 2020 report that “in every state and in over 95% of counties with more than 30,000 people in which at least 1% of the residents are Black, Black people are arrested at higher rates than white people for marijuana possession.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Despite cannabis being legal for recreational adult use in 24 states and </span><a href=\"https://disa.com/marijuana-legality-by-state\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:decriminalized in 32 states;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>decriminalized in 32 states</span></a><span>, the national trends in racial disparities among </span><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/report/tale-two-countries-racially-targeted-arrests-era-marijuana-reform\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:weed possession arrests;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>weed possession arrests</span></a><span> have remained unchanged since 2010. That disparity is glaring among Black women cannabis users; think about how </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/gender-identity/shacarri-richardsons-cannabis-suspension-is-emblematic-of-a-larger-issue-black-women-in-the-industry-say/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:(the childless) Sha’carri Richardson;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>(the childless) Sha’carri Richardson</span></a><span> was treated when her weed use went public.</span></p><p><span>All the women in this story expressed concern about the repercussions they could face because they’re Black moms who smoke weed. </span></p><p><span>“</span><span>Cannabis may show up in the urine drug screen of a breastfed infant,” Wetterer explains. Black and brown parents have been historically unfairly targeted via the so-called war on drugs and, therefore, “are more likely to be tested for drug use, problematically sometimes without patient consent, and also more likely to have their children taken away if they are reported to the family regulation system commonly known as Children Protective Services.”</span></p><p><span>Wetterer criticizes this </span><span>protocol. “I do not think that anyone should be surveilled or criminalized or have their parenting drawn into question if they do decide to use cannabis.”</span></p><p><span>Black moms are also confronted by a deeply-rooted stigma against cannabis in their own communities. Systemic racism has broken down so many Black families by jailing parents for charges linked to weed that the fear of prison or loss of employment made weed a common enemy. But hopefully, the tide continues to shift.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Today, it’s evident from the incredible women in my community that Black moms understand that cannabis use is their right —&nbsp;and that the racist connotations assigned to certain drugs need to be dismantled. If the medical community begins to see cannabis as another drug that we should approach with hope and caution, we may be able to get far more use out of it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“It’s OK for moms to romanticize having a glass of wine at the end of the day, but for some reason, people think moms who consume cannabis are hotboxing their homes while rocking the baby to sleep,” King says. “There are so many ways to consume cannabis responsibly and still show up as a great parent.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Our children’s health is always paramount — and that’s a fact. But it’s become overwhelmingly evident, through my conversations with Black birthing cannabis enthusiasts, that showing up as a great parent every day means being your most authentic self. That requires remembering who you were before the baby was born and keeping that person alive, too. We can’t pour from an empty vessel, after all. And sometimes, to keep our vessel full, it needs the support of a one-hitter packed with ganja.</span></p><p><em>If you or someone you know needs help, call or text 988 or chat&nbsp;<a href=\"https://988lifeline.org/chat/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:988lifeline.org;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">988lifeline.org</a>&nbsp;for mental health support.
