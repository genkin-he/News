LANTEAUME)</figcaption></div></figure><p>The first US flights carrying detained migrants to America&#39;s notorious Guantanamo military base in Cuba were underway Tuesday as President Donald Trump&#39;s administration cracks down on illegal migration, the White House said.</p><p>Guantanamo is primarily known as a detention center for suspects accused of terrorism-related offenses, but the base also has a history of being used to hold migrants, and Trump last week ordered the preparation of a 30,000-person &quot;migrant facility&quot; there.</p><p>&quot;Today, the first flights from the United States to Guantanamo Bay with illegal migrants are underway,&quot; Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Fox Business.</p><p>Trump has launched what his second administration is casting as a major effort to combat illegal migration, trumpeting immigration raids, arrests and deportations on military aircraft.</p><p>The president has made the issue a priority on the international stage as well, threatening Colombia with sanctions and massive tariffs for turning back two planeloads of deportees.</p><p>The Guantanamo prison was opened in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and has been used to indefinitely hold detainees seized during the wars and other operations that followed.</p><p>The conditions there have prompted consistent outcry from rights groups, and UN experts have condemned it as a site of &quot;unparalleled notoriety.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;Perfect place&#39; -</p><p>Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden both sought to close the facility, but Congress has opposed efforts to shutter Guantanamo and it remains open to this day.</p><p>It still holds 15 people incarcerated for militant activity or terrorism-related offenses, among them several accused plotters of the 9/11 attacks, including self-proclaimed mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.</p><p>But migrants will be detained in a separate part of the base.</p><p>According to US Southern Command, there are some 300 American military personnel at Guantanamo supporting &quot;illegal alien holding operations.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The base has for decades been used to hold Caribbean asylum seekers and refugees caught at sea, and was used in the 1990s to house tens of thousands of Haitians and Cubans who fled crises in their homelands.</p><p>They were accommodated in tent cities, with many eventually sent home after being held at Guantanamo for years.</p><p>Thousands of undocumented migrants have been arrested since Trump&#39;s January 20 inauguration, including some accused of crimes.</p><p>An unknown number have been repatriated to Colombia, Mexico, Guatemala, Brazil and other countries, and Trump has vowed to expel millions.</p><p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday described Guantanamo as the &quot;perfect place&quot; to detain migrants as he visited the border with Mexico -- an area where the Trump administration has boosted the country&#39;s military presence in recent weeks.</p><p>The Pentagon will provide any necessary assets &quot;to support the expulsion and detention of those in our country illegally,&quot; Hegseth said.</p><p>wd/bjt</p></div></article></div>",

Donald Trump unleashes trade wars and tariffs, the system for settling such disputes within the World Trade Organization has been paralysed for years -- by the United States.</p><p>Having returned to the White House, Trump has imposed a 10 percent tariff hike on Chinese goods, with Beijing immediately retaliating with tariffs on US imports of energy, cars and machinery parts.</p><p>China said Tuesday that it would file a complaint with the WTO over the &quot;malicious&quot; US levies -- but that move is likely to hit a dead end, unless Beijing and Washington resolve the spat of their own accord.</p><p>- Obama, Trump, Biden roadblock -</p><p>The WTO was founded in 1995 as a successor to GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade dating back to 1948.</p><p>The process for resolving a dispute at the Geneva-based global trade body goes through several stages.</p><p>When a complaint is brought, consultations are initiated between the members at odds with each other.</p><p>If no agreement is reached, the complainant can request the establishment of a special panel, made up of three to five experts. Countries can appeal against the panel&#39;s ruling.</p><p>But the WTO&#39;s Appellate Body, composed of seven specialists in international law and trade, has not been able to handle any new cases since December 2019: its seats remain empty due to the United States blocking nominations.</p><p>This practice began under US president Barack Obama, continued throughout Trump&#39;s first term, and carried on under his successor Joe Biden.</p><p>Washington accuses the Appellate Body of over-interpreting international trade rules and not respecting WTO deadlines for completing cases.</p><p>The United States also insists the body&#39;s decisions must not encroach on &quot;national security&quot;.</p><p>In 2022, the WTO&#39;s members decided to hold discussions aimed at having a fully operational system up and running by 2024 -- but no agreement has yet been reached.</p><p>In the meantime, a number of WTO members, including the European Union and China, have developed an alternative appellate process allowing some cases move forward.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Among those cases is a spat between Brussels and Colombia over Bogota&#39;s anti-dumping duties on imports of frozen fries from three EU nations.</p><p>But the United States has not signed up.</p><p>So while this temporary system works well for the participating countries, it does not prevent other WTO members from continuing to file appeals to the moribund Appellate Body -- effectively leaving the cases in limbo.</p><p>- Into the void -</p><p>Currently, 32 dispute panel rulings &quot;have been appealed into the void&quot;, according to the WTO.</p><p>As a result, the decisions of the agency&#39;s Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) do not apply because the appeal is up in the air.</p><p>Of these 32 appeals, two were filed by the United States -- against China and Turkey -- and 11 were filed against the United States, including three by China, two by Canada and two by Turkey.</p><p>And although the Appellate Body is not functioning, a number of countries are continuing to launch initial complaints, as China has now done.</p><p>The last time Washington brought a dispute in the first instance was in July 2019, in an agricultural spat with India. The two countries have since reached an agreement.</p><p>When a country is rebuked by the dispute settlement body, it must implement the experts&#39; recommendations within a so-called reasonable timeframe set by the DSB. Sanctions can be imposed if the country does not fulfil its obligations.</p><p>apo/rjm/nl/js</p></div></article></div>",

(-)</figcaption></div></figure><p>US President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are expected to speak by phone on Tuesday, just hours after slapping tariffs on each other&#39;s economies in an escalating trade war.</p><p>Beijing said it was imposing levies on imports of US energy, vehicles and equipment in a return salvo minutes after Trump&#39;s threatened tariffs on Chinese goods came into effect.</p><p>Trump suspended tariffs on Mexico and Canada on Monday for a month after they vowed to step up measures to counter flows of the drug fentanyl and crossing of undocumented migrants into the United States.</p><p>Stock markets wavered on Tuesday as investors braced for volatile market activity in the coming weeks over Trump&#39;s threatened tariffs on the three biggest US trading partners.</p><p>&quot;Let&#39;s see what happens with the call today,&quot; Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro, a veteran of the US president&#39;s first term, told news outlet Politico.</p><p>Asked if Trump could halt the tariffs on China too, he added: &quot;It&#39;s up to the boss. I never get ahead of the boss, that&#39;s why I&#39;m sitting here.&quot;</p><p>Trump imposed fresh 10 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, on top of levies that were already in place against America&#39;s biggest economic competitor. Mexico and Canada had faced 25 percent tariffs.</p><p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that Trump was due to talk to Xi, but said Tuesday that &quot;I don&#39;t have any updates on when that call will take place.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He is not going to allow China to continue to source and distribute deadly fentanyl into our country, that was the reason for this tariff,&quot; Leavitt told reporters outside the West Wing.</p><p>- &#39;Malicious&#39; -</p><p>China unveiled levies of 15 percent on imports of coal and liquefied natural gas from the United States, while crude oil, agricultural machinery, big-engined vehicles, and pickup trucks face 10 percent duties.</p><p>It says it will also probe US tech giant Google and the American fashion group which owns Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Beijing said the measures were in response to the &quot;unilateral tariff hike&quot; by Washington. It said it would also file a complaint to the World Trade Organization over the &quot;malicious&quot; levies.</p><p>It also unveiled fresh export controls on rare metals and chemicals including tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, and molybdenum, used in a range of industrial appliances.</p><p>China is a major market for US energy exports and according to Beijing customs data, imports of oil, coal and LNG totaled more than $7 billion last year.</p><p>But that is dwarfed by China&#39;s imports from more friendly powers such as Russia, from which it purchased $94 billion-worth last year.</p><p>- Last-minute deals -</p><p>Trump has made tariffs a key foreign policy tool of his second term, joking that the word tariff is the &quot;most beautiful&quot; in the dictionary.</p><p>The Republican billionaire said his tariffs aimed to punish countries for failing to halt flows of illegal migrants and drugs including the powerful opioid fentanyl into the United States.</p><p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had both struck last-minute deals with Trump on Monday to tighten border measures, leading to a 30-day pause on threatened tariffs.</p><p>Talks will continue for the next month on broader deals.</p><p>Mexico said it had begun the 10,000-strong border troop deployment it had promised Trump as part of the agreement to halt tariffs.</p><p>&quot;The deployment has already started,&quot; Sheinbaum told reporters.</p><p>More than 450,000 people have been murdered countrywide since Mexico launched a major offensive against drug cartels in 2006.</p><p>Trudeau meanwhile said Canada would appoint a &quot;Fentanyl Czar&quot; and list drug cartels as terrorist organizations.</p><p>burs-dk/bjt</p></div></article></div>",

the complexity and cost of complying with the world&#39;s first legislation on the use of the technology.</p><p>The Artificial Intelligence Act, binding since last year, will be fully applicable on Aug. 2, 2026, with certain provisions kicking in earlier, such as the ban on certain practices from Feb. 2 this year.</p><p>&quot;The ambition is to provide legal certainty for those who provide or deploy the artificial intelligence systems on the European market, also for the market surveillance authorities. The guidelines are not legally binding,&quot; a Commission official told reporters.</p><p>Prohibited practices include AI-enabled dark patterns embedded in services designed to manipulate users into making substantial financial commitments, and AI-enabled applications which exploit users based on their age, disability or socio-economic situation.</p><p>AI-enabled social scoring using unrelated personal data such as origin and race by social welfare agencies and other public and private bodies is banned, while police are not allowed to predict individuals&#39; criminal behaviour solely based on their biometric data if this has not been verified.</p><p>Employers cannot use webcams and voice recognition systems to track employees&#39; emotions, while mobile CCTV cameras equipped with AI-based facial recognition technologies for law enforcement purposes are prohibited, with limited exceptions and stringent safeguards.</p><p>EU countries have until Aug. 2 to designate market surveillance authorities to enforce the AI rules. AI breaches can cost companies fines ranging from 1.5% to 7% of their total global revenue.</p><p>The EU AI Act is more comprehensive than the United States&#39; light-touch voluntary compliance approach while China&#39;s approach aims to maintain social stability and state control.</p><p>(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Alison Williams)</p></div></article></div>",

his return to the White House (Jim WATSON)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was set to meet Donald Trump on Tuesday, the first foreign leader hosted by the new US president, with the pair poised to address the fragile Gaza truce.</p><p>After Trump claimed credit for securing the Israel-Hamas truce after more than 15 months of fighting and bombing, he was likely to urge his ally to stick to the deal -- parts of which have yet to be finalised.</p><p>In a possible sign of progress, Israel said hours ahead of the White House meeting that it was sending a team to mediator Qatar to discuss the second phase of the agreement, which could lead to a more permanent end to the war.</p><p>Palestinian group Hamas said on Tuesday that negotiations for the second phase had begun, with spokesman Abdel Latif al-Qanou saying the focus was on &quot;shelter, relief and reconstruction&quot; for the war-ravaged Gaza Strip.</p><p>Trump has touted a plan to &quot;clean out&quot; Gaza, calling for Palestinians to move to Egypt or Jordan.</p><p>Both countries have flatly rejected his proposal, as have the territory&#39;s own residents.</p><p>&quot;Trump thinks Gaza is a pile of garbage -- absolutely not,&quot; said Hatem Azzam, a 34-year-old resident of the Gaza Strip.</p><p>&quot;Trump and Netanyahu must understand the reality of the Palestinian people and the people of Gaza. This is a people deeply rooted in their land. We will not leave,&quot; he added.</p><p>In line with the ceasefire, Palestinian militant groups and Israel have begun exchanging hostages held in Gaza for prisoners in Israeli custody.</p><p>- &#39;Redrawn the map&#39; -</p><p>The war began when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, taking into Gaza 251 hostages, dozens of whom have since been confirmed dead.</p><p>Seventy-six are still held in the Palestinian territory including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.</p><p>Families of the Israeli hostages have been urging all sides to ensure the agreement is maintained so their loved ones can be freed.</p><p>Relatives of the youngest hostages, Ariel and Kfir Bibas, made a plea on Monday for information on the two boys and their mother, Shiri, after their father Yarden Bibas was released in the latest swap.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;Shiri, Ariel and Kfir, we miss you so much and are waiting for you,&quot; said Ofri Bibas, Yarden&#39;s sister.</p><p>Before leaving for Washington, Netanyahu said Israel&#39;s wars with Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and its confrontations with Iran since October 2023 had &quot;redrawn the map&quot; of the Middle East.</p><p>&quot;I believe that working closely with President Trump we can redraw it even further, and for the better,&quot; he said.</p><p>Trump, who prides himself on his dealmaking abilities, may seek to offer Netanyahu incentives to sticking to the truce, such as a normalisation deal with Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Efforts under Trump&#39;s predecessor Joe Biden for normalisation froze with the Gaza war, and Saudi Arabia has in recent months hardened its position insisting there would be no agreement without a Palestinian state.</p><p>Trump said Sunday that talks with Israel and other Middle Eastern countries were &quot;progressing&quot; -- before warning that he had &quot;no assurances&quot; and &quot;no guarantees&quot; that the truce in Gaza would hold.</p><p>The US president&#39;s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who met Netanyahu on Monday over terms for the second phase of the truce, said that he was &quot;certainly hopeful&quot;.</p><p>- West Bank violence -</p><p>Since the truce took effect on January 19, Israel has turned its focus to the occupied West Bank, launching a deadly operation in the area around Jenin, a hotbed of Palestinian militancy.</p><p>UN aid agency UNRWA, which is now banned in Israel, warned the refugee camp of Jenin was &quot;going into a catastrophic direction&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Large parts of the camp were completely destroyed in a series of detonations by the Israeli forces. It is estimated that 100 houses were destroyed or heavily damaged,&quot; said UNRWA spokeswoman Juliette Touma.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Israeli army said a gunman killed two Israeli soldiers in an attack on a military post in Tayasir, south of the Jenin area in the northern West Bank. The assailant was also killed.</p><p>Asked about how he viewed a possible annexation of the West Bank, Trump did not rule it out, telling reporters that Israel was &quot;a small country in terms of land&quot;.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s a pretty small piece of land. And it&#39;s amazing that they&#39;ve been able to do what they&#39;ve been able to do,&quot; he said.</p><p>Under the Gaza ceasefire&#39;s ongoing 42-day first phase, Hamas was to free 33 hostages in staggered releases in exchange for around 1,900 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.</p><p>Four hostage-prisoner exchanges have already taken place, with militants freeing 18 hostages in exchange of some 600 mostly Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.</p><p>The truce has also led to a surge of food, fuel, medical and other aid into Gaza, and allowed people displaced by the war to return to the north of the Palestinian territory.</p><p>Hamas&#39;s attack resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people on Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p><p>Israel&#39;s retaliatory response has killed at least 47,518 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory&#39;s health ministry. The UN considers these figures as reliable.</p><p>burs-ser/ami</p></div></article></div>",
