care;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">gender-affirming care</a> for people under age 19 in response to an executive order from President Donald Trump aimed at curtailing federal funding for such treatments.</p><p>In a letter, James, a Democrat, told health care facilities that refusing to provide the treatments would violate New York’s anti-discrimination laws.</p><p>“Regardless of the availability of federal funding, we write to further remind you of your obligations to comply with New York State laws,” her letter reads.</p><p>Trump, a Republican, last week signed an executive order that directed agencies to take steps to make sure that hospitals receiving federal research and education grants “end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.” The language in the order — using words such as “maiming,” “sterilizing” and “mutilation” — contradicts what is typical for <a

care;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">gender-affirming care</a> in the United States.</p><p>The letter from James came as some hospitals in Colorado, Virginia and Washington, D.C., said they were pausing gender-affirming treatments for young people while administrators evaluate the order. The White House on Monday released a statement that said the executive order was “already having its intended effect.”</p><p>A spokesperson for the Greater New York Hospital Association said they were in close contact with member hospitals about the gender-affirming care executive order.</p><p>“We are collaboratively working through every aspect of the EO to determine its legal and clinical implications. That work is ongoing,” Brian Conway said in an email.</p><p>Gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth is not common but such treatments have been the subject of fierce political debate. Fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents in the U.S. with commercial insurance received puberty blockers or hormones during a recent five-year period, according to a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-hormones-puberty-blockers-youth-562cba3c3ae43e88d5144f7adb4efd7c\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:new study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">new study</a>.</p></div></article></div>",

from leaving the country without permission, as it seeks to shore up its forces fighting rebel groups opposed to its rule.</p><p>The junta has lost control of swathes of the country to ethnic minority armed groups and other opposition forces in the civil war triggered by its coup d&#39;etat four years ago.</p><p>A long-dormant conscription law was enforced last year as the army reeled from a string

without obtaining the permission of the Central Body,&quot; section 51 of the bylaw says.</p><p>The rule applies to those who have been called up and also those waiting for the outcome of appeals for exemption, reduction, or postponement of military service.</p><p>Breaking the rules can bring a jail sentence of up to three years.</p><p>The military service law, authored by a previous junta in 2010 but brought into force only in February last year, requires those called up to serve for at least two years.</p><p>It also has a stipulation that during a state of emergency, the terms of service can be extended up to five years, and those ignoring a summons to serve can be jailed for the same period.</p><p>Myanmar has been under a state of emergency since soon after a February 2021 coup, with the junta announcing the latest six-month extension on Friday.</p><p>Rights groups estimate tens of thousands of young people have fled Myanmar to avoid being called up to the deeply unpopular

ahead of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#39;s meeting with US President Donald Trump on Tuesday.</p><p>Netanyahu will be the first foreign leader to meet Trump in the White House since his return to power last month, and will likely face some pressure to honour the ceasefire the US leader has claimed credit for.</p><p>Hours before their meeting, Netanyahu&#39;s office said Israel would send a delegation to the Qatari capital Doha later this week for negotiations.</p><p>Hamas has said it is ready to negotiate the second stage of the ceasefire, mediated by Qatar, the United States and Egypt, and which should focus on a more permanent end to the war.</p><p>The first phase, which took effect on January 19, halted more than 15 months of bombardment and fighting that has levelled much of the Gaza Strip.</p><p>In line with the agreement, Hamas and Israel have begun exchanging hostages held in Gaza for prisoners held in Israeli jails.</p><p>&quot;Israel is preparing for the working-level delegation to leave for Doha at the end of this week in order to discuss technical details related to the continued implementation of the agreement,&quot; Netanyahu&#39;s office said following meetings with Trump&#39;s advisors, including Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.</p><p>- &#39;Redrawn the map&#39; -</p><p>The war began when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, taking into Gaza 251 hostages, dozens of whom have since been confirmed dead.</p><p>The conflict has devastated much of Gaza, while families of the Israeli hostages have been urging all sides to ensure the agreement is maintained so their loved ones can be freed.</p><p>Relatives of the youngest hostages, Ariel and Kfir Bibas, made a plea on Monday for information on the two boys and their mother, Shiri, after their father Yarden Bibas was released in the latest swap.</p><p>&quot;Shiri, Ariel and Kfir, we miss you so much and are waiting for you with Yarden now,&quot; Ofri Bibas, Yarden&#39;s sister, said.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story

the territory&#39;s own residents.</p><p>&quot;We are the owners of this land; we have always been here, and will always be. The future is ours,&quot; said Majed al-Zebda, a father of six whose house was destroyed in the war.</p><p>Before leaving for Washington, Netanyahu said Israel&#39;s wars with Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and its confrontations with Iran had &quot;redrawn the map&quot; in the Middle East.</p><p>&quot;But I believe that working closely with President Trump we can redraw it even further, and for the better,&quot; he said.</p><p>Netanyahu hailed the fact he would be the first foreign leader to meet Trump since his inauguration as &quot;testimony to the strength of the Israeli-American alliance.&quot;</p><p>Trump, who prides himself on his dealmaking abilities, will be pushing Netanyahu to stick to the agreement, possibly offering incentives such as a normalisation deal with Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Efforts under Trump&#39;s predecessor Joe Biden for normalisation froze with the Gaza war, and Saudi Arabia has in recent months hardened its position.</p><p>- Focus on West Bank? -</p><p>Trump said Sunday that talks with Israel and other Middle Eastern countries were &quot;progressing&quot; -- but warned that he had &quot;no assurances&quot; that the truce in Gaza would hold.</p><p>&quot;I have no assurances that it will hold, I mean I&#39;ve seen people brutalised, nobody&#39;s ever seen anything like it, no I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold,&quot; he said.</p><p>Witkoff, who met Netanyahu on Monday over terms for the second phase of the truce, said however that he was &quot;certainly hopeful&quot;.</p><p>Since the truce took effect, Israel has turned its focus to the occupied West Bank, launching a deadly operation in the area around Jenin, a hotbed of Palestinian militancy.</p><p>UN aid agency UNRWA, which is now banned in Israel, warned the refugee camp of Jenin was &quot;going into a catastrophic direction&quot;.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Israeli army said a gunman killed two Israeli soldiers in an attack on a military post in Tayasir in the West Bank. The assailant was also killed.</p><p>Asked about how he viewed a possible annexation of the West Bank, Trump told reporters: &quot;It&#39;s a small country in terms of land.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s a pretty small piece of land. And it&#39;s amazing that they&#39;ve been able to do what they&#39;ve been able to do,&quot; he said.</p><p>Under the Gaza ceasefire&#39;s ongoing 42-day first phase, Hamas was to free 33 hostages in staggered releases in exchange for around 1,900 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.</p><p>Four hostage-prisoner exchanges have already taken place, with militants freeing 18 hostages in exchange of some 600 mostly Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.</p><p>The truce has also led to a surge of food, fuel, medical and other aid into Gaza, and allowed people displaced by the war to return to their neighbourhoods in the north of the Palestinian territory.</p><p>Hamas&#39;s attack resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people on Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p><p>Israel&#39;s retaliatory response has killed at least 47,518 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory&#39;s health ministry. The UN considers these figures as reliable.</p><p>burs-ser/dv</p></div></article></div>",

debug code and evaluate AI-related scenarios, has benefited from businesses that are looking to deploy generative AI technology.</p><p>&quot;Palantir is the Michael Jordan of AI stocks right now, not only capturing investors&#39; imagination but delivering game-winning shots when it counts,&quot; said Matt Britzman, Senior Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.</p><p>Meanwhile, the company&#39;s

It is not,” said Weissmann.</p><p>“It is enough that it’s about the FBI,” he continued. “But I want to make people understand it is far more egregious than what Nixon tried to do by just removing the special counsel to say, ‘I shouldn’t be investigated.’”</p><p>With Trump, Weissmann argued: “This is saying, ‘I am a king. I can disobey all civil service rules.’ He has the number two at the Justice Department agreeing. So this is unlike what happened in the ‘Saturday Night Massacre,’ where the Justice Department was saying, ‘Fire me because I’m not doing something that’s illegal.’”</p><p>Watch Weissmann’s full analysis here:</p><div class=caas-iframe-wrapper data-embed-anchor=d9abac92-7ef3-56f7-a435-b799475ff0a0><div class=\"caas-iframe youtube\" style=padding-bottom:56% data-type=youtube><blockquote data-src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/v8mcWCEBP28?rel=0 allowfullscreen scrolling=no><div class=caas-card-loader></div><noscript><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/v8mcWCEBP28?rel=0 allowfullscreen></iframe></noscript></blockquote></div></div><h3>Related...</h3><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tim-walz-steven-cheung-posts_n_67a1be34e4b0ec9b03541c2d\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Tim Walz Triggers Trump White House Comms Director Into Super Weird Post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Tim Walz Triggers Trump White House Comms Director Into Super Weird Post</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-elon-musk-name_n_67a1cb06e4b09c948561f139\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Trump Just Bungled Elon Musk’s Name.

$530 billion in 2024 (GREG BAKER)</figcaption></div></figure><p>China has made good on its threats to retaliate in the escalating trade war with the United States, imposing tariffs on American imports of energy, cars and machinery parts.</p><p>That came just minutes after a 10 percent tariff hike on Chinese goods, announced by US President Donald Trump on Saturday, came into effect.</p><p>Here&#39;s the state of play in the rocky US-China trade relationship:</p><p>- How much trade is at stake? -</p><p>Trade between China and the United States, the world&#39;s two largest economies, is vast, totalling more than $530 billion in 2024.</p><p>Sales of Chinese goods to the United States over the same period totalled more than $400 billion, second only to Mexico.</p><p>China is the dominant supplier of goods from electronics and electrical machinery to textiles and clothing, according to the Peterson Institute of International Economics (PIIE).</p><p>But a yawning trade imbalance -- $270.4 billion last year -- has long raised hackles in Washington.</p><p>So has China&#39;s vast state support for its industries, sparking accusations of dumping, as well as its perceived mistreatment of US firms operating in its territory.</p><p>China&#39;s economy remains heavily reliant on exports to drive growth despite official efforts to raise domestic consumption, making its leaders reluctant to change the status quo.</p><p>- What happened during Trump&#39;s first term? -</p><p>Trump stormed into the White House for his first term in 2016 vowing to get even with China, launching a trade war that imposed significant tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods.</p><p>China responded with retaliatory tariffs on US products that particularly affected American farmers.</p><p>Key US demands were greater access to China&#39;s markets, broad reform of a business playing field that heavily favours Chinese firms, and a loosening of heavy state control by Beijing.</p><p>After long, fraught negotiations the two sides agreed what became known as the &quot;phase one&quot; trade deal -- a ceasefire in the nearly two-year trade war.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Beijing agreed under that agreement to import $200 billion worth of US goods, including $32 billion in farm products and seafood.</p><p>However, in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic and a US recession, analysts say Beijing fell well short of that commitment.</p><p>&quot;In the end, China bought only 58 percent of the US exports it had committed to purchase under the agreement, not even enough to reach its import levels from before the trade war,&quot; the PIIE&#39;s Chad P Brown wrote.</p><p>- How did things change under Biden? -</p><p>Joe Biden, whose presidency was bookended by Trump&#39;s two terms in office, did not roll back the increases imposed by the Republican but took a more targeted approach when it came to tariff hikes.</p><p>Under Biden, Washington expanded efforts to curb exports of state-of-the-art chips to China, part of a broader effort to prevent sensitive US technologies being used in Beijing&#39;s military arsenal.</p><p>His administration also used tariffs to take aim at what it called China&#39;s &quot;industrial overcapacity&quot; -- fears the country&#39;s industrial subsidies for green energy, cars and batteries could flood global markets with cheap goods.</p><p>Biden ordered tariffs last May on $18 billion worth of imports from China, accusing Beijing of &quot;cheating&quot; rather than competing.</p><p>Under the hikes, tariffs on electric vehicles quadrupled to 100 percent, while the tariff for semiconductors surged from 25 percent to 50 percent.</p><p>- What happens next? -</p><p>Beijing&#39;s new tariffs will come into effect on Monday.</p><p>Tariffs of 15 percent will be imposed on&nbsp;imports of coal and liquefied natural gas from the United States.</p><p>Crude oil, agricultural machinery, big-engined vehicles and pickup trucks face 10 percent duties.</p><p>China is a major market for US energy exports and, according to Beijing customs data, imports of oil, coal and LNG totalled more than $7 billion last year.</p><p>By following through with the levies, Trump has shown tariff threats were serious and not an opening gambit in negotiations.</p><p>The mercurial magnate has also tied tariffs to the fate of Chinese-owned social media app TikTok -- warning of retaliation if a deal cannot be struck to sell it.</p><p>Trump has ordered an in-depth review of Chinese trade practices, the results of which are due by April 1.</p><p>Analysts say that could serve as a &quot;catalyst&quot; for even more tariffs on Chinese imports.</p><p>However, the strong riposte has left little doubt that Beijing will push back against measures it has long viewed as unfair.</p><p>China said on Tuesday it had filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization over the &quot;malicious&quot; levies, although that is unlikely to bring change in the short term.</p><p>Separately, its State Administration for Market Regulation announced a probe into US tech giant Google over violations of anti-monopoly laws.</p><p>bur-isk/oho/je/pbt</p></div></article></div>",

hollow, highlighting the risk posed by Japan's ageing water pipes (STR)</figcaption></div></figure><p>A massive sinkhole near Tokyo that swallowed a truck and its driver a week ago, and has filled with sewage and debris, highlights the risk posed by Japan&#39;s ageing pipes.</p><p>Emergency workers have been striving in vain to reach the 74-year-old man, who rescuers have had no contact with for a week, and who was likely buried under sediment and sewage water in the sinkhole in the city of Yashio.</p><p>Officials say corroded sewerage pipes created the sinkhole that is now 40 metres (130 feet) wide -- nearly the size of an Olympic swimming pool -- and 15 metres (50 feet) deep.</p><p>Cranes have been mobilised and a 30-metre slope built to locate and reach the driver, with a second slope under construction, but progress has been slow and dangerous.</p><p>Koichi Yamamoto, an official with Yashio&#39;s fire department, told AFP on Tuesday that rescue efforts had been suspended.</p><p>A &quot;substantial&quot; amount of sewage water has accumulated at the site, eroding the surrounding soil and &quot;constantly flowing in like a river&quot;, he said.</p><p>&quot;This makes it impossible for us to proceed.&quot;</p><p>Also &quot;hampering our rescue operation is a pile-up of heavy masses such as debris, slabs of asphalt and concrete that need removing&quot;, Yamamoto added.</p><p>When the hole suddenly opened up in Yashio, in the region of Saitama near Tokyo, during the morning rush hour on Tuesday last week, it at first looked like just one of thousands of sinkholes reported annually across Japan.</p><p>Their occurence is trending upwards in Japan, topping 10,000 in fiscal 2022, with many of the sinkholes sewage-related in urban areas, a land ministry probe shows.</p><p>- Ageing pipes -</p><p>Initially the hole was around five metres in diameter, then a much larger cavity opened nearby and the two holes merged.</p><p>To reduce the volume of sewage, locals were urged to &quot;use as little water as possible&quot; for three hours on Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>This was on top of requests already issued for about 1.2 milion people in Saitama to refrain from non-essential use of water, such as taking baths or doing laundry.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>In response, some onsens have opened their public bath facilities for free to accommodate residents in Yashio and nearby areas, according to local media.</p><p>The week-long sinkhole saga was a reminder of the insidious corrosion gnawing at Japan&#39;s ageing water and sewerage pipes, Shinya Inazumi, a professor of geotechnical engineering at Shibaura Institute of Technology, told AFP.</p><p>The majority of the underground infrastructure was developed during the country&#39;s rapid post-war economic growth. </p><p>&quot;Many sewerage pipes in Japan have already outlived their service life (of 50 years) so pipes anywhere else could break due to ageing,&quot; Inazumi said.</p><p>In just over 15 years&#39; time, 40 percent of Japan&#39;s sewerage pipes will have exceeded their lifespan, according to an estimate from the land ministry.</p><p>In Yashio, local authorities attributed the initial chasm to rusty, punctured sewerage pipes that absorbed the surrounding soil, creating a hollow under the ground.</p><p>Extreme weather events such as intense rain -- made more frequent by climate change -- can also exacerbate this kind of infrastructure failure, Inazumi said.</p><p>&quot;Rainfall these days can be extremely heavy and localised, which means a great amount of water seeps underground,&quot; the professor said.</p><p>&quot;The water gushes in at an incredible speed, accelerating the growth of an underground hollow by making it bigger and bigger through erosion.&quot;</p><p>tmo/kaf/sco</p></div></article></div>",
