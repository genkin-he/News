scale, suggesting that Beijing is hoping for a last-minute deal but also giving them the option to inflict more pain if needed, analysts say.</p><p>China on Tuesday fired a return salvo in its escalating trade war with the United States, slapping fresh tariffs on everything from American crude oil to agricultural machinery.</p><p>The moves hit roughly $20 billion worth of US goods per year -- roughly 12 percent of total American imports into China, according to calculations by Capital Economics.</p><p>Over a third of that is energy: according to Beijing customs data, imports of oil, coal and LNG totalled more than $7 billion last year.</p><p>Beijing has also slapped fresh export controls on rare metals and chemicals including tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, indium and molybdenum, used in everything from mining to phone screens.</p><p>China dominates global supply chains for rare metals.</p><p>The countermeasures came as a surprise to some -- analysts at UBS this week told AFP they had expected Beijing to keep its powder dry.</p><p>But they are a far cry from the 10 percent tariffs slapped on all Chinese imports by US President Donald Trump this week that will affect some $450 billion worth of goods.</p><p>&quot;The measures are fairly modest, at least relative to US moves,&quot; Capital Economics&#39;s Julian Evans-Pritchard said.</p><p>They &quot;have clearly been calibrated to try to send a message to the US (and domestic audiences) without inflicting too much damage,&quot; he added.</p><p>- Limited room for manoeuvre -</p><p>That restraint can in part be explained by China&#39;s reliance on many US imports for its industries and its longstanding economic woes at home, Agatha Kratz at the Rhodium Group told AFP.</p><p>&quot;Given the current economic downturn, China cannot afford -- and does not want -- to impose excessive trade barriers,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;China&#39;s economy is in a fragile state, and this limits its ability to act freely,&quot; she explained.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;Beijing cannot afford to take reckless actions, and I don&#39;t think it wants to.&quot;</p><p>Far from inflicting deep pain, analysts say Beijing&#39;s goal is to send a message to Washington: that China can and will retaliate to swingeing tariffs.</p><p>&quot;These tariffs are structured to signal China&#39;s capacity to endure prolonged economic confrontation while forcing the US to deal with internal economic pressures,&quot; Mingzhi Jimmy Xu, an assistant professor at Peking University, to AFP.</p><p>- &#39;Serious

Will rate cuts need to - and be able to - do the heavy lifting to boost growth? That&#39;s our focus this week.</p><p>Trump fires his first tariff salvo, hitting Asian currencies including the rupee. And is India having a rethink of its approach to cryptocurrencies?

Now it&#39;s the central bank&#39;s turn.</p><p>Saturday&#39;s budget announcement focused on urban middle-class consumers and their clamour for relief from the high cost of living. Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#39;s government offered tax cuts that it hopes will boost consumption, along with some narrower policy steps such as funds for the strategic petroleum reserve and a stronger push into nuclear energy.</p><p>But analysts were disappointed at the lack of economic reforms that could propel growth back towards aspirational rates above 8%.</p><p>The measures fall some way short of constituting major stimulus, Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging market economist at Capital Economics, said in a report.</p><p>The onus now shifts to the Reserve Bank of India. Economists polled by Reuters expect it to begin cutting interest rates for the first time in more than four years when it meets this week.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Some forms of monetary policy easing have already begun. The central bank is adding liquidity to the banking system and has eased enforcement actions against non-bank lenders, which had made the sector more risk-averse. This should help to push up bank loan growth, which has fallen for six consecutive months.</p><p>The authorities have also loosened their grip on the rupee, allowing a greater degree of depreciation which in turn acts as a stimulus to exports.</p><p>How deep can they cut?</p><p>It&#39;s over to rate policy now, although economists doubt whether rate cuts alone could take India back to 8% growth within the next couple years.</p><p>HSBC expects two rate cuts in February and April of 25 basis points each, bringing down India&#39;s benchmark policy rate to 6%, in a &quot;shallow&quot; easing cycle, Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC, said in a report. Market volatility and brewing global trade wars could pressure India&#39;s balance of payments and weaken its currency, she said, preventing steeper rate cuts.</p><p>JPMorgan, however, expects 100 basis points in rate cuts in 2025, beginning this week, said Sajjid Chinoy, the bank&#39;s head of Asia economic research, in a December report.</p><p>Economists saw little risk that the budget&#39;s stimulus steps would stir up inflation and narrow the scope for rate reductions.</p><p>The government aims to trim the budget gap, or fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP, to 4.4% for 2025/26 from 4.8% this year, which would not be inflationary, HSBC&#39;s Bhandari said.</p><p>With inflation falling, &quot;we expect the RBI to cut rates and infuse domestic liquidity, picking up the growth baton&quot;, she said.</p><p>JPMorgan&#39;s Chinoy added that, with food prices expected to soften early this year on the back of a strong harvest and with GDP growth expected at 6.4% in the current financial year, well below the RBI&#39;s original estimate of 7.2%, there is room for significant rate easing.</p><p>How low should interest rates fall in India? Will the RBI rate cuts be enough to boost growth? Write to me with your views at ira.dugal@thomsonreuters.com.</p><p>Quote of the week</p><p>&quot;More than one or two jurisdictions have changed their stance towards cryptocurrency in terms of the usage, their acceptance, where they see the importance of crypto assets.&quot;</p><p>India&#39;s Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth told Reuters in an interview that the government is reviewing its approach to cryptocurrencies amid changes in policy globally.</p><p>Such assets &quot;don&#39;t believe in borders&quot; and India&#39;s stance cannot be unilateral, Seth said.</p><p>The Indian authorities have yet to release a discussion paper on cryptocurrency regulation originally scheduled for last September.

and Elizabeth Pineau</p><p>PARIS (Reuters) - All eyes are on the French capital next week to see if U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration can find common ground with China and nearly 100 other nations on the safe development of artificial intelligence.</p><p>About a year after world powers reckoned with the dangers of AI in England’s Bletchley Park, a wider array of countries are gathering in Paris to discuss putting the technology to work.</p><p>France, eager to promote its national industry, is hosting the AI Action Summit alongside India on Feb. 10 and 11, with a focus on areas where Europe’s second-largest economy has an advantage: freely available or “open-source” systems, and clean energy to power data centers.</p><p>Mitigating labor disruption and promoting sovereignty in a global AI market are also on the agenda.</p><p>Top executives from Alphabet, Microsoft and dozens of other businesses are slated to attend. Government leaders are expected to dine on Monday with select CEOs. And talks will include one on Tuesday by Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, two people involved in the summit told Reuters.</p><p>It was less clear whether the U.S. will reach consensus with other nations on AI.</p><p>Since taking office on Jan. 20, President Trump has revoked former President Joe Biden’s 2023 executive order on the technology, set in motion a repeat withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and faced Congressional calls to consider new export controls on AI chips to counter rival China.</p><p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance will attend for the American delegation.</p><p>A non-binding communiqué of principles for the stewardship of AI, bearing U.S., Chinese and other signatures, has been under negotiation and would mark a big achievement if reached, said the people involved in the summit, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p><p>They declined to detail the communiqué or elaborate if there were any points of disagreement among the would-be signatories.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>An official for the French presidency said the summit will give voice to countries around the world, not only the U.S. and China.</p><p>&quot;We are showing that AI is here, that companies must adopt it, that it is a vector of competitiveness for France and for Europe,&quot; the Élysée official said.</p><p>NO NEW AI REGULATION</p><p>Safety commitments dominated the conversation in prior global AI summits in Bletchley Park and Seoul. In Paris, creating new regulation is not on the agenda.</p><p>Reeling from red tape and a reputation for risk aversion, Europe and particularly France are eager to discuss frameworks for AI policy but not rules that could slow down their national champions, which have lagged American companies. Countries like France are evaluating how to implement the EU AI Act in as flexible a way as possible so it does not discourage innovation, the people involved in the summit said.</p><p>Instead in focus is how to distribute AI’s benefits to developing nations, via cheaper models made by the likes of France’s startup Mistral and China’s DeepSeek. The Hangzhou-based company rocked global markets last month by showing it could vie with U.S. heavyweights on human-like reasoning technology, while charging much less.</p><p>France has seized on the development as evidence that the global race to more powerful AI remains wide open.</p><p>One of the summit’s likely outcomes is that philanthropies and businesses are expected to commit an initial $500 million in capital, going up to $2.5 billion over five years, to fund public-interest projects on AI around the world, the people said.</p><p>Another is addressing the energy crunch that industry thinks is inevitable from their power-hungry AI models. A major producer of clean energy in the form of nuclear power, France wants to reconcile the world’s climate and AI ambitions.</p><p>France&#39;s decarbonized energy and &quot;nuclear fleet, in the context of data center installations, is an asset,&quot; the Élysée official said. &quot;We will most likely have announcements in this regard at the summit.&quot;</p><p>(Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin and Elizabeth Pineau; Additional reporting by Nandita Bose and Anna Tong; Editing by David Gregorio)</p></div></article></div>",

submitted for the former democracy leader&#39;s home -- the third time the sale has flopped.</p><p>The two-storey Yangon house, with about 0.8 hectares (1.9 acres) of land, was put up for sale with a minimum price of $140 million following a decades-long dispute over the property between the Nobel laureate and her brother.</p><p>Suu Kyi, who spent years under house arrest at the mansion under a former junta, has been detained since the military seized power once again in February 2021.</p><p>Around a dozen journalists, watched over by security personnel in plain clothes, attended the kerbside sale outside the colonial-era house on leafy University Avenue, a few doors from the US embassy.</p><p>After calling for bids starting from 297 billion kyats -- around $140 million at the official exchange rate -- and getting no response, the auctioneer called off the sale, AFP reporters at the scene saw.</p><p>&quot;I announce the auction is not successful after calling for bids three times,&quot; the auctioneer said.</p><p>Similar auctions failed in March and August last year.</p><p>With Myanmar&#39;s economy shattered by the civil war triggered by the military coup, it is unclear who in the country would be in a position to spend $140 million on a single, increasingly dilapidated property.</p><p>Real estate agents say similar-sized properties in upmarket Yangon areas might fetch $1 million to $2 million.</p><p>The house holds a special place in Myanmar history -- Suu Kyi was confined within its crumbling walls for around 15 years after shooting to fame during huge demonstrations against the then-junta in 1988.</p><p>Cut off from her husband and children in England, Suu Kyi spent time playing the piano, reading detective novels and meditating as her status as a democracy leader grew.</p><p>Hundreds of people would regularly gather on the pavement outside to hear her talk about&nbsp;democracy and fighting military rule through non-violence.</p><div

Kyi, 79, is serving a 27-year prison sentence on charges ranging from corruption to not respecting Covid-19 pandemic restrictions -- charges rights groups say are a junta sham designed to eliminate her politically.</p><p>bur-pdw/mtp</p></div></article></div>",
