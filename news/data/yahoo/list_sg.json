AFP.</p><p>Indonesia, which has some of the world&#39;s toughest drug laws, has in recent weeks released half a dozen high-profile detainees, including a Filipina mother on death row and the last five members of the so-called &quot;Bali Nine&quot; drug ring.</p><p>Serge Atlaoui, 61, was driven from Salemba prison in Jakarta to the city&#39;s main airport where he will be handed over to French police officers before boarding a commercial flight to Paris.</p><p>In France, he will be presented to prosecutors &quot;and most likely detained while awaiting a decision on the adaptation (of his sentence)&quot;, his lawyer Richard Sedillot told AFP.</p><p>Jakarta has left it to the French government to grant Atlaoui -- the only Frenchman on death row in Indonesia -- &quot;clemency, amnesty or a reduced sentence&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Serge is happy and calm&quot;, added Sedillot, &quot;but he is going to need a little bit of time to reorganise himself.&quot;</p><p>His return was made possible after an agreement between the French Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin and his Indonesian counterpart Yusril Ihza Mahendra on January 24.</p><p>In the agreement, Jakarta said they had decided not to execute Atlaoui and authorised his return on &quot;humanitarian grounds&quot; because he was ill.</p><p>Atlaoui has been receiving weekly medical treatment at a hospital.</p><p>- Death penalty appeal

factory.</p><p>&quot;I thought there was something suspicious (about the factory),&quot; Atlaoui told AFP in 2015.</p><p>Initially sentenced to life in prison, his sentence was reviewed by the supreme court and changed to death on appeal.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story

them are 90 foreigners, including at least one woman, according to the Ministry of Immigration and Correction.</p><p>The Indonesian government recently signalled it will resume executions, on hiatus

(-)</figcaption></div></figure><p>China said Tuesday it would impose tariffs on imports of US energy, vehicles and equipment, firing a return salvo in an escalating trade war between the world&#39;s two biggest economies.</p><p>US President Donald Trump on Saturday announced sweeping measures against major trade partners Canada and Mexico, with goods from China hit with an additional 10 percent tariff on top of the duties they already endure.</p><p>Minutes after they came into effect, Beijing unveiled levies of 15 percent on imports of coal and liquefied natural gas from the United States, while crude oil, agricultural machinery, big-engined vehicles, and pickup trucks face 10 percent duties.</p><p>China is a major market for US energy exports and according to Beijing customs data, imports of oil, coal and LNG totalled more than $7 billion last year.</p><p>But that is dwarfed by China&#39;s imports from more friendly powers such as Russia, from which it purchased $94 billion-worth last year.</p><p>Beijing said the measures were in response to the &quot;unilateral tariff hike&quot; by Washington.</p><p>The US decision, China said, &quot;seriously violates World Trade Organization rules, does nothing to resolve its own problems, and disrupts normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the United States&quot;.</p><p>With that in mind, Beijing said it would file a complaint with the WTO over the &quot;malicious&quot; levies.</p><p>Alongside its tariffs, China announced a probe into US tech giant Google and the addition of US fashion group PVH Corp. -- which owns Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein -- and biotech giant Illumina to a list of &quot;unreliable entities&quot;.</p><p>Beijing also unveiled fresh export controls on rare metals and chemicals including tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, and molybdenum, used in a range of industrial appliances.</p><p>&quot;I think the retaliation is not aggressive, as China only targets some US products, in response to the US tariff on all China&#39;s exports to the US,&quot; Zhang Zhiwei of Pinpoint Asset Management said in a note.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;This is likely only the beginning of a long process for the two countries to negotiate&quot;</p><p>- Canada, Mexico deals -</p><p>Trump has said his tariffs aimed to punish countries for failing to halt flows of illegal migrants and drugs including fentanyl into the United States.</p><p>But he said Monday that he planned a call with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in the next 24 hours.</p><p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had both earlier struck last-minute deals with Trump to tighten border measures against the flow of migrants and fentanyl into the United States, leading to a 30-day pause on threatened tariffs.</p><p>Asian equities spiked Tuesday on news of the paused tariffs, and hopes that similar negotiations could relieve the levies against the world&#39;s number-two economy provided extra optimism.</p><p>However, traders pared some of those gains as China unveiled its measures.</p><p>Markets had slumped Monday as Trump&#39;s threat of sweeping levies on imports from Canada and Mexico sparked fears of a global trade war.</p><p>The president said that after &quot;very friendly&quot; talks with Sheinbaum he would &quot;immediately pause&quot; the tariffs on Mexico, and that his counterpart had agreed to send 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico frontier.</p><p>- &#39;Not a trade war&#39; -</p><p>Tensions appeared higher between the United States and Canada -- but after two calls with Trudeau, Trump said on Truth Social that the prime minister had &quot;agreed to ensure we have a secure Northern Border, and to finally end the deadly scourge of drugs like Fentanyl&quot;.</p><p>Trudeau said Canada would deploy nearly 10,000 frontline officers to help secure the border, list drug cartels as terrorists, appoint a &quot;Fentanyl Czar&quot; and crack down on money laundering.</p><p>It was not clear the real extent of the changes on the Canadian border, given that authorities said in December they already had 8,500 personnel deployed.</p><p>Canada, China and Mexico are the United States&#39;s three biggest trading partners.</p><p>The White House said earlier there had been a &quot;heck of a lot of talks&quot; over the weekend.</p><p>&quot;This is not a trade war, this is a drug war,&quot; National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC, complaining that &quot;the Canadians appeared to have misunderstood the plain language&quot;.</p><p>However, US government figures show that only a minimal quantity of drugs enter via Canada.</p><p>- 51st state? -</p><p>Ottawa had vowed to respond strongly to the tariffs.</p><p>Canadians have booed the US national anthem at sporting events, cancelled holidays in the United States and boycotted American products.</p><p>Its most populous province Ontario on Monday banned US firms from bidding on tens of billions of dollars in government contracts -- and dumped a deal with Trump ally Elon Musk&#39;s Starlink.</p><p>Trump has upped the pressure recently by calling Canada&#39;s existence into question -- once again advocating on Monday for it to become the 51st US state.</p><p>A political crisis in the Canadian government over Trump&#39;s tariff threats led to Trudeau announcing last month that he would resign. Canadians now face elections as early as April.</p><p>Mexico has meanwhile been under heavy pressure to secure its border with the United States as Trump vows a massive crackdown on undocumented migrants.</p><p>burs-oho/je/dan</p></div></article></div>",

years in Governor Sanjay Malhotra&#39;s first monetary policy review on Friday, aiming to boost economic growth which is seen falling to a four-year low.</p><p>Over 70% of respondents, 45 of 62, in a Jan. 22-30 Reuters poll forecast the RBI would cut its key repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% at the conclusion of its Feb. 5-7 meeting, while others expect it will keep rates unchanged, mostly because of above-target inflation.</p><p>The monetary policy review follows closely on the heels of the federal budget, where the government slashed personal tax rates to boost spending and spur growth.</p><p>&quot;With the finance ministry still keeping the overall fiscal deficit in check, there is scope for the RBI to do more to boost the economy,&quot; said Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.</p><p>&quot;This strengthens our conviction that the Bank – under new leadership - will begin easing monetary policy at the conclusion of its MPC meeting on Friday,&quot; he added.</p><p>The government said it is likely to post a full-year fiscal deficit of 4.8% of GDP in the current year ending March and expects to improve its finances, targeting a fiscal deficit of 4.4% in 2025-26.</p><p>The Indian economy is seen expanding by 6.3%-6.8% in the coming fiscal year after likely growing 6.4% this year, its weakest in four years and sharply below the 8.2% pace in fiscal 2024.</p><p>Despite the slowdown in growth, inflation has stayed above the central bank&#39;s medium-term target of 4% for most of the past year, while the rupee has been steadily weakening, despite substantial dollar selling intervention from the RBI.</p><p>While core inflation, seen as a better measure of demand driven price pressures, has been below 4%, some economists believe the central bank may still need to focus on bringing down headline inflation.</p><p>&quot;With the budget ring-fencing growth risks, the monetary policy committee could concentrate on inflation management, while taking into account external spillovers,&quot; said Vivek Kumar, an economist with QuantEco Research who doesn&#39;t expect a cut on Friday but expects a total 50 bps easing in H1 FY26.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story

stance,&quot; he added.</p><p>The RBI announced a host of measures in late January which together would infuse 1.5 trillion rupees ($17.22 billion) into the banking system, but investors are hopeful of more steps including another a cash reserve ratio reduction on Friday.

FONG)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Japanese video game giant Nintendo on Tuesday cut its annual net profit forecast after hardware and software sales for its Switch console fell in the first three quarters.</p><p>The Switch, which is both a handheld and TV-compatible device, hit shelves in 2017 and became a must-have gadget among all age groups during pandemic lockdowns.</p><p>Nintendo announced in January that it will release the console&#39;s hotly anticipated successor -- the Switch 2 -- in 2025, but stopped short of revealing details such as pricing.</p><p>On Tuesday, Nintendo revised its full-year net profit forecast to 270 billion yen ($1.7 billion) from 300 billion yen.</p><p>&quot;Nintendo Switch hardware and software sales through the third quarter were below expectations,&quot; the company said in its explanation of the profit warning.</p><p>&quot;The sales trend&quot; in the April-December period and &quot;prospects for the remainder of the fiscal year, as well as a reevaluation of the assumed exchange rate&quot; were also behind the decision.</p><p>Over the nine months, net profit dropped 42 percent to 237 billion yen and sales tumbled 31 percent to 956 billion yen.</p><p>The company also lowered its Switch hardware sales forecast to 11 million units from 12.5 million units.</p><p>&quot;Sales of both hardware and software declined compared to the same period of last fiscal year, when sales were substantially driven by &#39;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&#39;... and &#39;Super Mario Bros. Wonder&#39;,&quot; Nintendo said.</p><p>&quot;Going forward, we will continue to release new offerings so even more consumers keep playing Nintendo Switch,&quot; it added.</p><p>Nintendo has promised to reveal more details about the Switch 2 in early April after it released a brief but slick video preview in January.</p><p>In the two-minute video, the new console looks bigger but is broadly similar in design to the original hybrid Switch.</p><p>Serkan Toto&nbsp;from Tokyo consultancy Kantan Games told AFP ahead of the earnings release that &quot;Nintendo was way too optimistic about Switch 1 sales when they released their hardware sales forecast for the current fiscal year.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Toto said that while &quot;the initial reaction by gamers was mixed&quot; to the &quot;drip feed&quot; Switch 2 announcement, the popularity of the new console would be key.</p><p>&quot;Switch 2 absolutely must be a success, as Nintendo has developed into a single-platform company, he said.</p><p>&quot;For decades, Nintendo actually ran two distinct businesses, namely TV versus handheld gaming,&quot; but now &quot;Nintendo has no Plan B in case a console fails&quot;.</p><p>nf-kaf/mtp</p></div></article></div>",

ready for negotiations on a new phase in their fragile Gaza ceasefire.</p><p>Netanyahu, the first foreign leader to visit the White House since Trump returned to power last month, will discuss the truce&#39;s future and efforts to end the Gaza war.</p><p>Hours before their meeting, Netanyahu&#39;s office said Israel would send a delegation to the Qatari capital Doha later this week for negotiations.</p><p>&quot;Israel is preparing for the working-level delegation to leave for Doha at the end of this week in order to discuss technical details related to the continued implementation of the agreement,&quot; the office said in a statement following meetings in Washington between Netanyahu and Trump&#39;s advisors, including Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.</p><p>Hamas has said it is ready to negotiate the second stage of the ceasefire, mediated by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States.</p><p>The next phase aims to secure the release of remaining hostages and lay out steps toward ending the war, which has devastated the Palestinian territory of 2.4 million people.</p><p>- &#39;No guarantees&#39; -</p><p>The war broke out after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly touted a plan to &quot;clean out&quot; Gaza, calling for Palestinians to move to neighbouring countries such as Egypt or Jordan, despite all those parties strongly rejecting his proposal.</p><p>Before leaving for Washington, Netanyahu said Israel&#39;s wars with Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and its confrontations with Iran had &quot;redrawn the map&quot; in the Middle East.</p><p>&quot;But I believe that working closely with President Trump we can redraw it even further, and for the better,&quot; he said.</p><p>The White House meeting promises to be a crucial one for a region shattered by war since Hamas&#39;s deadly attack on Israel.</p><p>Netanyahu hailed the fact he would be the first foreign leader to meet Trump since his January 20 inauguration as &quot;testimony to the strength of the Israeli-American alliance.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button

death toll in Gaza, despite Biden&#39;s steadfast maintenance of US military aid.</p><p>But Trump, who has claimed credit for sealing the ceasefire after 15 months of war and prides himself on his

refiners replaced the tropical oil with cheaper rival soyoil because of negative refining margins for palm oil, five dealers said.</p><p>Lower palm oil imports by India, the world&#39;s biggest buyer of vegetable oils, could weigh on benchmark Malaysian palm oil prices, but support U.S. soyoil futures.</p><p>Palm oil imports plunged 46% in January from the previous month to 272,000 metric tons, the lowest since March 2011, according to estimates from dealers.</p><p>India imported an average of more than 750,000 tons of palm oil every month in the marketing year that ended in October 2024, says trade body the Solvent Extractors&#39; Association of India, which is set to publish its January import data by mid-February.</p><p>Reuters reported last month that palm oil imports would sink to a multi-year low in January as refiners were shifting to soyoil.</p><p>Soyoil imports in January rose 4% from a month earlier to 438,000 metric tons, the highest in seven months, while sunflower oil imports jumped 9.5% to 290,000 metric tons, dealers said.</p><p>Lower shipments of palm oil brought down the country&#39;s total edible oil imports in January by 15.6% to 1 million tons, the lowest in 11 months, according to dealers&#39; estimates.</p><p>Negative margins for palm oil prevailed for Indian refiners last month, which discouraged them from making overseas purchases, said Rajesh Patel, managing partner at GGN Research, an edible oil trader.</p><p>Palm oil usually trades at a discount to soyoil and sunflower oil, but falling stocks have lifted its prices above rival oils, whose supplies are abundant.</p><p>Palm oil traditionally accounts for more than half of India&#39;s total edible oil imports, but its share fell below 30% for the first time in more than a decade, said Sandeep Bajoria, CEO of Sunvin Group, a vegetable oil brokerage.</p><p>India buys palm oil mainly from Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, while it imports soyoil and sunflower oil from Argentina, Brazil, Russia and Ukraine.</p><p>(Reporting by Rajendra Jadhav; Editing by Mrigank Dhaniwala)</p></div></article></div>",
