the deadliest school attack in the Scandinavian country&#39;s history.</p><p>Authorities had initially said that several people were wounded in the violence at Campus Risbergska, a secondary school for young adults in the town of Orebro, but had not reported any fatalities.</p><p>School attacks are relatively rare in Sweden, but the country has suffered shootings and bombings linked to gang violence that kill dozens of people each year.</p><p>&quot;Around 10 people have been killed today,&quot; Orebro police chief Roberto Eid Forest told reporters, adding that police could &quot;not be more specific about the number due to the large number of wounded&quot;.</p><p>He provided no details about the number of wounded.</p><p>He said police were not aware of a motive yet, but believed the gunman had acted alone.</p><p>&quot;This is a terrible event. This is exceptional, a nightmare,&quot; Forest said.</p><p>Police did not disclose any information about the identity or ages of the dead, nor whether they were students or teachers at the school.</p><p>Several media reported the suspected gunman turned his gun on himself but police would not confirm those reports.</p><p>- &#39;A lot of gunshots&#39; -</p><p>Forest said police received the first reports of a school shooting at 12:33 pm (1133 GMT), but could not specify how it unfolded.</p><p>&quot;We have been working on the basis that there was ongoing deadly violence inside the school,&quot; Forest said.</p><p>The attacker is also believed to have carried some form of equipment to create smoke inside the school, he added. </p><p>Two Campus Risbergska teachers, Miriam Jarlevall and Patrik Soderman, told newspaper Dagens Nyheter they heard gunfire in a hallway.</p><p>&quot;Students came and said someone was shooting. Then we heard more shooting in the hallway. We didn&#39;t go out, we hid in our offices,&quot; they said.</p><p>&quot;There were a lot of gunshots at first and then it was quiet for a half-hour and then it started again. We were lying under our desks, cowering.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Some witnesses told Swedish media they heard what they believed to be automatic gunfire.</p><p>Swedish television channel TV4 meanwhile reported that police had raided the suspect&#39;s home in Orebro late on Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>It said the suspect was around 35 years old and had a license to carry a weapon and no criminal record, but did not provide any details about his identity.</p><p>Police have not confirmed that information.</p><p>A church near the school was open Tuesday evening to provide support to the community.</p><p>- Schools in lockdown -</p><p>Students in several nearby schools as well as the one in question had been locked in for several hours &quot;for safety reasons&quot; before gradually being released, police said.</p><p>&quot;It is a very painful day for all of Sweden,&quot; Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson wrote on X.</p><p>&quot;My thoughts are also with all those whose normal school day was replaced with horror. Being confined to a classroom fearing for your own life is a nightmare that no one should have to experience.&quot;</p><p>Kristersson, who said the government was &quot;closely monitoring developments&quot;, was to hold a press conference at 7:30 pm (1830 GMT).</p><p>A mother whose son was kept indoors at his nearby school for several hours during the police operation told AFP she was &quot;shocked&quot; and &quot;angry&quot;.</p><p>&quot;My son is at this school behind us, they&#39;re locked in too. They have to hide, so I&#39;m waiting for them to evacuate,&quot; Cia Sandell, 42, said.</p><p>&quot;This is crazy, totally crazy. I&#39;m angry, I&#39;m shocked. This shouldn&#39;t happen,&quot; she said.</p><p>Though such shootings are rare, several other violent incidents have struck Swedish schools in recent years.</p><p>In March 2022, an 18-year-old student stabbed two teachers to death at a secondary school in the southern city of Malmo.</p><p>Two months earlier, a 16-year-old was arrested after wounding another student and a teacher with a knife at a school in the small town of Kristianstad.</p><p>In October 2015, three people were killed in a racially-motivated attack at a school in the western town of Trollhattan by a sword-wielding assailant who was later killed by police.</p><p>bur-po/jll/db</p></div></article></div>",

seizing computers, hard drives and phones, and detaining two male employees &quot;who do not hold any senior management position&quot;.</p><p>It said it would not provide further comment, fearing for the security of the detained employees, and asked that the authorities &quot;take care of our colleagues and release them as soon as possible&quot;.</p><p>In a statement on social media site X the Taliban information ministry said the station had been suspended. </p><p>&quot;Besides multiple violations, it was providing materials and programmes to a TV station based abroad,&quot; it said.</p><p>&quot;Due to the violation of the broadcasting policy and improper use of the license (from the ministry), the radio station was suspended today so that the related documents can be carefully evaluated and the final decision can be taken,&quot; it added.</p><p>Radio Begum said it has never been involved in any political activity and was &quot;committed to serving the Afghan people and more specifically the Afghan women&quot;.</p><p>The station was founded on March 8, International Women&#39;s Day, 2021, five months before the Taliban swept to power, ousting the US-backed

assistance.</p><p>Rubio, currently on a Latin America tour, doubled down on President Donald Trump&#39;s 90-day suspension of assistance as reports emerge around the world of local aid groups curtailing or stopping life-saving aid.</p><p>&quot;I issued a blanket waiver that said, if this is life-saving programs, OK; if it&#39;s providing food or medicine or anything that is saving lives and is immediate and urgent, you&#39;re not included in the freeze,&quot; Rubio told reporters in Costa Rica.</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know how much more clear we can be than that,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;I would say if some organization is receiving funds from the United States and does not know how to apply a waiver, then I have real questions about the competence of that organization, or I wonder whether they&#39;re deliberately sabotaging it for purposes of making a political point,&quot; said the former Republican senator.</p><p>A day earlier, Rubio said he had been made acting head of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) as Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk look at drastically scaling back aid and merging the organization under the State Department.</p><p>Non-governmental groups say they have heard multiple cases of aid groups that have struggled to operate, mostly smaller organizations that provide targeted services such as health care or education and did not have reserves.</p><p>Some schools have shuttered in Uganda, where USAID was backing a universal education program, and demining work has been disrupted in Cambodia, among other cases.</p><p>- Targeted support to allies -</p><p>Rubio announced that he was issuing new waivers to ensure the flow of assistance to Costa Rica, a major US partner on issues including migration and drug-trafficking.</p><p>US assistance includes biometric work to stop smugglers, which Rubio pointed out as an example of concrete American help that benefits its own interests.</p><div

the example of Costa Rica, whose relations with China have turned rockier in recent years.</p><p>Chaves in 2023 effectively forbade Chinese tech titan Huawei from bidding for the nation&#39;s 5G network due to Beijing&#39;s refusal to sign an international agreement on cybercrime.</p><p>&quot;When you confront companies that are not secure, they&#39;re backed by governments like the

system in the United States, enabling students to access personalized tutoring and study guides through the chatbot, while the faculty will be able to use it for administrative tasks.</p><p>OpenAI has

Trump&#39;s administration cracks down on illegal migration, the White House said.</p><p>Guantanamo is primarily known as a detention center for suspects accused of terrorism-related offenses, but the base also has a history of being used to hold migrants, and Trump last week ordered the preparation of a 30,000-person &quot;migrant facility&quot; there.</p><p>&quot;Today, the first flights from the United States to Guantanamo Bay with illegal migrants are underway,&quot; Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Fox Business.</p><p>Trump has launched what his second administration is casting as a major effort to combat illegal migration, trumpeting immigration raids, arrests and deportations on military aircraft.</p><p>The president has made the issue a priority on the international stage as well, threatening Colombia with sanctions and massive tariffs for turning back two planeloads of deportees.</p><p>The Guantanamo prison was opened in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and has been used to indefinitely hold detainees seized during the wars and other operations that followed.</p><p>The conditions there have prompted consistent outcry from rights groups, and UN experts have condemned it as a site of &quot;unparalleled notoriety.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;Perfect place&#39; -</p><p>Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden both sought to close the facility, but Congress has opposed efforts to shutter Guantanamo and it remains open to this day.</p><p>It still holds 15 people incarcerated for militant activity or terrorism-related offenses, among them several accused plotters of the 9/11 attacks, including self-proclaimed mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.</p><p>But migrants will be detained in a separate part of the base.</p><p>According to US Southern Command, there are some 300 American military personnel at Guantanamo supporting &quot;illegal alien holding operations.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The base has for decades been used to hold Caribbean asylum seekers and refugees caught at sea, and was used in the 1990s to house tens of thousands of Haitians and Cubans who fled crises in their homelands.</p><p>They were accommodated in tent cities, with many eventually sent home after being held at Guantanamo for years.</p><p>Thousands of undocumented migrants have been arrested since Trump&#39;s January 20 inauguration, including some accused of crimes.</p><p>An unknown number have been repatriated to Colombia, Mexico, Guatemala, Brazil and other countries, and Trump has vowed to expel millions.</p><p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday described Guantanamo as the &quot;perfect place&quot; to detain migrants as he visited the border with Mexico -- an area where the Trump administration has boosted the country&#39;s military presence in recent weeks.</p><p>The Pentagon will provide any necessary assets &quot;to support the expulsion and detention of those in our country illegally,&quot; Hegseth said.</p><p>wd/bjt</p></div></article></div>",
