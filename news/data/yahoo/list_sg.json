the traditional big European data centre hubs of Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris and Dublin, where electric grid constraints are limiting capacity growth.</p><p>As a result, secondary markets are booming around Europe. Milan, Warsaw and Berlin are expanding the fastest in 2025, but firms are increasingly looking outside cities.</p><p>CBRE forecasts capacity coming online this year - measured in the data centre business by the amount of electricity needed to power it - will be around 9.1 gigawatts, with hyperscalers taking up more than a third.</p><p>CBRE estimates the average price across Europe to build &quot;colocation&quot; space, or space rented by big companies, inside a data centre at 12 million euros ($12.50 million) per megawatt.</p><p>That implies Europe&#39;s industry is expanding by more than 100 billion euros this year, but that pales beside ongoing U.S. investments, notably the &quot;Stargate&quot; initiative for Oracle, Microsoft and OpenAI to spend $500 billion over the next four years.</p><p>&quot;Europe risks falling into technological dependency, watching as AI leadership consolidates between the U.S. and China,&quot; Stijn Grove, managing director of the Dutch Data Center Association, said.</p><p>($1 = 0.9602 euros)</p><p>(Reporting by Toby Sterling; editing by Barbara Lewis)</p></div></article></div>",

class=caas-body><p>NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Foreign companies have often struggled in India due to high tax demands related to duty evasion on imports or levies payable on big M&A transactions, leading to prolonged litigation at times.</p><p>Here are some of the key past and current tax disputes involving foreign companies:</p><p>KIA</p><p>South Korea&#39;s Kia has been accused of dodging $155 million in taxes by misclassifying some car component imports, but the company is contesting the charge privately with officials, Reuters reported on Wednesday.</p><p>At the heart of the dispute lie Kia&#39;s imports of parts of a car in separate shipments to assemble the vehicles in India, paying a lower tax applicable, circumventing the higher tax outgo when parts come together as a CKD, or a completely knocked down unit, of a car.</p><p>VOLKSWAGEN</p><p>In a similar case as Kia, Volkswagen has sued Indian authorities in a Mumbai court after being slapped with a $1.4 billion tax notice for importing parts related to its 14 models, including some Audi ones, instead of classifying them as CKD.</p><p>The German automaker&#39;s court challenge states that India&#39;s &quot;impossibly enormous&quot; tax demand will hit its investment in the country, and foreign investor sentiment.</p><p>VODAFONE</p><p>In one of the most controversial cases, Vodafone was slapped with a $2 billion tax demand when it purchased Indian assets of Hutchison Whampoa in an $11 billion deal in 2007.</p><p>The dispute saw years-long litigation including a ruling in company&#39;s favour by India&#39;s top court, followed by a change of law which reimposed the demand and an international arbitration between the two sides. Vodafone won the arbitration case in 2020.</p><p>CAIRN ENERGY</p><p>Britain&#39;s Cairn Energy faced a more than $1.4 billion tax demand over the transfer of shares during an internal reorganization in 2007.</p><p>In 2011, Cairn Energy sold its majority stake in Cairn India to Vedanta Ltd, reducing its share in the Indian company to about 10%.</p><p>The Indian administration and Cairn India finally settled the years-long dispute in 2021 by offering to refund the tax amount.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>PERNOD RICARD</p><p>French liquor giant Pernod Ricard has been accused by Indian authorities of undervaluing certain imports for more than a decade to avoid full payment of duties.</p><p>India is demanding roughly $250 million in back taxes but the maker of Chivas Regal and Absolut vodka has contested the findings. The dispute is pending.</p><p>In 2022, Pernod warned Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#39;s administration that its long-running tax disputes with authorities on valuing liquor imports has inhibited fresh investment and its current business.</p><p>BYD</p><p>Chinese automaker BYD has been accused by Indian authorities of underpaying $8.37 million on parts for cars it assembles and sells in India.</p><p>BYD later deposited the demand but the probe is still ongoing and could lead to additional tax charges and penalties, Reuters has previously reported.</p><p>(Reporting by Arpan Chaturvedi; Editing by Aditya Kalra)</p></div></article></div>",

The timer on the oven beeps at me to flip the fish sticks when I hear a loud wail from the living room. My middle son has hit my oldest, and now they’re both clamoring for me in tears.</p><p><span>“What happened now?” I bellow, my nerve endings frazzled from the exhaustion of being a mom to three kids ages 5 and under while pregnant with my fourth.</span></p><p><span>“Come on, guys! I’m trying to cook dinner. Why can’t we just play nicely?”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Rather than respond with care and empathy for my child who got hurt, I feel like a volcano has erupted right there in the kitchen. Suddenly I’m burning to yell at everyone for everything. I take a huge breath in and hug my son. I direct a dirty glare toward my other kid but eventually hug him, too, and ask that the kids talk about and apologize for what happened.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Then I immediately feel ashamed of my overblown reaction. They’re just kids, and everyone is OK.</span></p><p><span>The thing is, this incident was par for my parenting. Everyday moments used to catapult me into a fit of rage: a cup of spilled juice, a splotch of marker on the ottoman, running a few minutes late to a social event. I would yell at my kids and shame them for little things, things that all kids do. I knew that what I was doing wasn’t great, and I knew it was probably harming my kids. But I didn’t know how to break the cycle.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I searched for answers, following social media accounts of well-known child psychologists and parenting experts, like Becky Kennedy (who gives phenomenal advice, by the way). I tried being more patient and empathetic with my kids, and it worked — to a degree. But there was still something inside of me that caused me to unleash on my kids at a moment’s notice. I’d then feel shame, apologize, and the cycle would repeat. I didn’t want to be a rage-filled, yelling, anxious mom. What was my problem?</span></p><p><span>I had seen talk therapists and cognitive behavioral therapists in the past when I went through a breakup or needed help communicating better with my husband. But after continued struggles as a mother, I knew I needed to dig deeper. Oddly enough, my mom had told me about her recent experience of seeing an EMDR therapist to work through traumatic memories from her childhood and how she felt freer, better than she ever had. In fact, she said she wished she had gone 30 years ago and told me that she and my dad would give me some money for it so I could experience the mental and emotional freedom that they had. Little did I know, I would exceed their gift and keep going to my therapist every other week for three years, spending over $4,000 out of pocket.&nbsp;</span></p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p><span>I signed up to see an EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) and IFS (internal family systems) therapist. EMDR is a psychotherapy technique that helps you reprocess traumatic memories to reduce the level of disturbance within your mind and body. During EMDR sessions, I would recall difficult core memories while I moved my eyes side to side. Over time, the memories that haunted me (and the memories I never knew existed that were underlying) became less potent and my anxiety less frequent.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>IFS psychotherapy involved seeing that I — and every human being — is made of multiple parts. Working within this model, I learned how to identify, accept and heal my younger parts, and create more harmony within myself.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Digging into childhood memories to heal myself as a mother sounded a bit “woo woo” and far-fetched, but week by week, the internal work fundamentally changed how I lived and parented.&nbsp;</span></p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 473px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:75%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"The author and her oldest son.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FZlNyElHsUJsYiXr8A3GZg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD05MzI-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/27be0ae9abfa989da1e00fc9bf2c733e><noscript><img alt=\"The author and her oldest son.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FZlNyElHsUJsYiXr8A3GZg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD05MzI-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/27be0ae9abfa989da1e00fc9bf2c733e class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>The author and her oldest son. <span class=\"copyright\">Courtesy Of Jenna Jonaitis</span></figcaption></div></figure><p><span>Across three years in therapy, I discovered that most of the incidents that triggered me in parenting were reminders of the past. I was surprised to uncover this because I had a “good” childhood. We always had a roof over our heads. My parents were generous (after all, they even paid for some of my therapy) and, like so many parents, did the best they knew how for their kids. They weren’t alcoholics or abusive. But some things I now realize I could have benefited from, like more emotional attuning and opportunities to speak my own voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>At first I was angry at my parents for all the things they had done or not done. And sure, anger is part of the healing process. But what was most transformative was focusing on how to notice when a younger, emotional part of me was being triggered by my own children.</span></p><p><span>Session after session, I sat on my therapist’s couch to talk about what was challenging me: spills, messes, running late, noises, a daughter who was loud and independent. Rather than handing out a list of coping skills, my therapist taught me how to notice when my body was being triggered by the past.</span></p><p><span>When my daughter shouted and resisted, a younger part of me remembered when I wasn’t allowed to speak up or balk at parental instruction.</span></p><p><span>When my sons fought, it reminded me of when my tears and feelings were suppressed.</span></p><p><span>When I’m running late, my body goes on high alert, remembering the pressure I felt to get out of the door as a kid.</span></p><p><span>My therapist told me that I had to learn to notice when something in my body changed, like a tenseness in my chest, a pause in my breath, my hands forming fists and shaking in the air. When those bodily manifestations begin, that’s my signal. That’s when I know I’m about to go off, rage or shame or yell. That’s when I know something is bubbling up from my past, something that keeps me from being present in the moment. If I do nothing, my body gets hijacked, and I respond with an emotional outburst instead of peace and calm.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So now that’s my daily work: noticing what’s happening in my body and when a younger part of me seems to be flaring up. Sometimes that means I picture my 5-year-old self in the room with me now, seeing her tiny face and golden blond hair. I might say hi to her and tell her that she’s safe now and she’s not that little girl anymore. She is strong and capable. The practice of seeing and talking to “little me” might sound trippy, and it certainly feels that way at times, but with practice, it works.</span></p><p><span>My therapist also told me I needed to get present in those triggering moments. Luckily, there are a few simple ways I can do that. I can rock my feet against the floor, pressing down on the hardwood from my ankle to my toes. I can glance at the wedding ring on my finger or the wrinkles on my hand to remind myself that I’m 37 now and married with four kids. I can look around the room and describe objects out loud, like the framed photo of the six of us at the beach or the thriving monstera plant sitting in the yellow pot. I can take a breath (not necessarily even a deep one) to find myself in my current adult body.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When I ground myself in the present (which, let’s be honest, isn’t easy to do when I’m overstimulated and exhausted), I can slow down the moment, almost as if I’m bending time. The slowness creates an opening, a chance to think before I respond to one of the kids. Like a bit of $4,000 magic, I can answer my daughter with more patience, give her a chance to speak her mind or cry in my arms.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>More than anything, I have more agency over my emotions and the inevitable triggers of parenthood. I feel more connected and grounded, and attuned to my kids. I’m calmer, less anxious, less reactive and explosive. Rather than yelling or shaming my kids when they spill their cereal, I’m more likely to say, “We can clean that up!” Rather than running myself ragged, answering everyone’s needs, I’m more likely to notice when I need a break. Stepping away for a few moments prevents me from saying or doing something I’ll regret.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I still mess up. I still say things to my kids I shouldn’t. I still raise my voice sometimes. But far less than I used to, which I believe my kids have noticed. They laugh more. They’re more at ease, less scared I’m going to go off on them. They seem more confident, too, and able to express their feelings. I’ll overhear one of the kids sharing how they feel sad or hurt as they work out the issue with their sibling. I watch in awe as my son asks for space when he’s frustrated.</span></p><p><span>I’m still learning. But I’m taking steps to do better, be better, just like my parents did in different ways. Without them, I wouldn’t have tried such innovative therapy. And that’s what parenthood is all about: healing and improving over time and doing the best we can with what we’ve got.</span></p><p><em>Do you have a compelling personal story you’d like to see published on HuffPost?

President Sara Duterte (JAM STA ROSA)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Philippine lawmakers voted on Wednesday to impeach Vice President Sara Duterte, who has fallen out spectacularly with the country&#39;s leader, paving the way for a Senate trial that could see her removed from office.</p><p>The House resolution charges Duterte with &quot;violation of the constitution, betrayal of public trust, graft and corruption, and other high crimes&quot;.</p><p>Accusations spelled out in the 44-page document include an alleged Duterte plot to assassinate President Ferdinand Marcos, first lady Liza Marcos and House Speaker Martin Romualdez that has been the subject of an investigation.</p><p>&quot;Having been filed by more than one-third of the membership of the House of Representatives, or a total of 215 members... the motion is approved,&quot; Romualdez, a Marcos cousin, told lawmakers Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>At a small rally outside the House of Representatives, student protester Darlene Cerico told AFP the impeachment represented a major victory, if an incomplete one.</p><p>&quot;I feel so happy because this proves the power of collective action. We know there are still many things to accomplish... to fully hold Sara Duterte accountable,&quot; Cerico said.</p><p>The fate of the former president&#39;s daughter now lies in the hands of the Philippines&#39; 24 senators, two-thirds of whom must vote for her impeachment to remove her from office and disqualify her from future public positions. A trial date has yet to be set.</p><p>Wednesday&#39;s impeachment vote follows on the heels of a trio of complaints filed in December that accused Duterte of a range of crimes including the &quot;brazen misuse&quot; of millions of dollars in public funds.</p><p>It also comes days before campaigning officially begins for mid-term elections, widely expected to set the table for the 2028 presidential race.</p><p>- &#39;Political opportunity&#39; -</p><p>Whether 16 senators cast their vote for Duterte&#39;s impeachment could come down to President Marcos, Dennis Coronacion, chairman of the political science department at the University of Santo Tomas, told AFP.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;If (Marcos) is committed to this one, to the impeachment process... I think getting the required number of Senate votes is possible,&quot; he said.</p><p>But should the administration stay hands-off, the chances of Duterte being impeached are closer to 50-50, Coronacion said, pointing to the sitting senators&#39; need for votes from the vice-president&#39;s stronghold of Mindanao in the coming election.</p><p>Jean Franco, assistant professor of political science at the University of the Philippines, said the coming trial represented a major opportunity for incumbent senators, who would benefit from hours of free television exposure.</p><p>&quot;This is a political opportunity for politicians. It can make or break politicians this impeachment process,&quot; she said, adding those not already in office would be on the outside looking in.</p><p>&quot;The game has been changed by this impeachment. All eyes are going to be on the process, so you&#39;re just going to be reacting to what&#39;s going to happen.&quot;</p><p>- Family feud -</p><p>The relationship between Duterte and President Marcos is at a nadir, their former alliance giving way to a months-long public battle that has seen wild accusations traded, including the alleged death threat.</p><p>But Marcos had previously urged Congress not to pursue Duterte&#39;s impeachment, calling it a &quot;storm in a teacup&quot; that would distract the legislature from its primary responsibilities.</p><p>Marcos&#39;s executive secretary Lucas Bersamin, however, said Monday that the Office of the President would &quot;not interfere&quot; with the impeachment complaints.</p><p>Duterte was widely tipped to succeed her father Rodrigo as president in 2022 elections but stepped aside to back Marcos and later ran for vice president on his ticket.</p><p>But the alliance has since imploded. In November, she delivered an expletive-laden speech saying she had ordered someone to kill Marcos if she herself was assassinated.</p><p>She later denied that her comments constituted a death threat, saying she had only been expressing &quot;consternation&quot; with the administration&#39;s failures.</p><p>The alleged assassination threat was among the allegations included in the last of the three complaints filed against Duterte.</p><p>With her impeachment, Duterte becomes one of only four high-ranking officials to share that fate since the Philippines returned to democracy after the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos Sr came to an end in 1986.</p><p>Along with a Supreme Court justice and a high-profile prosecutor, then-president Joseph Estrada was impeached in November 2000 on charges of embezzlement and taking kickbacks from illegal gambling operations.</p><p>When the Senate tribunal refused to accept key evidence, Filipinos took to the streets in a bloodless revolt, leading Estrada to step down when the military withdrew its support.</p><p>cgm/pam/cwl/dhw</p></div></article></div>",

European standards (Stefani Reynolds)</figcaption></div></figure><p>The European Commission announced Wednesday it would seek to impose new fees on e-commerce imports, as part of efforts to tackle a surge of &quot;harmful&quot; products into the bloc -- the bulk of them from China.</p><p>The EU action came after the US Postal Service (USPS) said it was suspending inbound parcels from China and Hong Kong, a move that could hit low-cost platforms Temu and Shein -- but the commission said the two actions were &quot;not coordinated&quot;.</p><p>Announcing the steps at a press conference in Brussels, EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen said the bloc had seen the number of imported e-commerce parcels double from 2023 to 2024, to reach 12 million a day.</p><p>&quot;Many of those products have been found to be unsafe, counterfeit or even dangerous,&quot; she said.</p><p>The commission called on EU lawmakers and member states to &quot;consider&quot; a handling fee on e-commerce parcels imported directly to consumers, to address the &quot;costs of supervising compliance&quot; with EU rules.</p><p>The move &quot;aims to address growing concerns about the impact of those products on the health and safety of European consumers,&quot; Virkkunen said.</p><p>&quot;It also looks into the significant environmental and climate damage caused by those shipments, and also the unlevel playing field which rogue traders create for our SMEs and businesses.&quot;</p><p>Around 90 percent of the packages concerned come from China, according to the commission, many of them sold by booming online giants Shein and Temu.</p><p>Both Chinese-founded platforms are suspected by Brussels of not doing enough to prevent the sale of products that do not meet European standards.</p><p>- Duty exemptions -</p><p>The commission also confirmed the launch of an investigation into Shein for not abiding by the bloc&#39;s consumer protection rules.</p><p>Brussels is coordinating the investigation with the Consumer Protection Cooperation Network, which brings together the competent authorities of the bloc&#39;s 27 member states.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>If Shein is found guilty it risks being fined.</p><p>Shein said it would &quot;engage&quot; its partners at EU and national government-level to &quot;study these recommendations.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We welcome efforts that enhance trust and safety for European

discovered, with Indonesian authorities accusing him of being a &quot;chemist&quot;.</p><p>A welder from Metz in northeastern France, he has always denied being a drug trafficker, saying that he was installing machinery in what he thought was&nbsp;an acrylic factory.</p><p>Atlaoui had left Jakarta for Paris on Tuesday evening on board a KLM flight via Amsterdam.</p><p>His return was made possible after an agreement between French Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin and his Indonesian counterpart, Yusril Ihza Mahendra, on January 24.</p><p>In the agreement, Jakarta said it had decided not to execute Atlaoui and authorised his return on &quot;humanitarian grounds&quot; because he was ill.</p><p>Atlaoui was tight-lipped and wore a face mask at a news conference at Jakarta&#39;s main

Kochi</figcaption></div></figure><div class=caas-body><p>By Manoj Kumar and Nikunj Ohri</p><p>NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India plans to review import tariffs on over 30 items, including luxury cars, solar cells and chemicals, a senior finance ministry official said, potentially leading to increased imports from the United States as global trade tensions grow.</p><p>The move, aimed at reducing average tariffs, comes ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#39;s visit to the U.S. next week.</p><p>In a bid to avoid President Donald Trump&#39;s growing tariff actions, India has already reduced average import tariff rates to 11% from 13% on several items in the latest budget.</p><p>The finance ministry official did not give the time period for the completion of the consultation process, but industry analysts say the process could take months.</p><p>Various Indian government departments, including those overseeing heavy industries and renewable energy, will soon consult local industry on reducing the Agriculture Infrastructure Development Cess (AIDC), Sanjay Agarwal, chairman of Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.</p><p>The AIDC is an alternative import tariff, collected by the Indian federal government for raising funds in a separate pool, and funds collected are used for building farm infrastructure.</p><p>Agarwal said the ministries would select items from this list for possible tariff reduction after industry consultations.</p><p>India has protected domestic industries such as autos, pharmaceuticals and farm sectors through state subsidies and high import tariffs, amid growing pressure to improve ties with the Trump administration.</p><p>The list includes 32 items such as luxury cars, solar cells, yachts, sports vessels, devices used in building semiconductors, and other machinery, all of which have seen the government impose AIDC tariff of between 6.5% and 70% on imports, after reducing the basic customs duties.</p><p>India&#39;s average import tariffs, including AIDC, are much higher than those of major trading partners including the United States, China and Japan, the official acknowledged.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;We can&#39;t take a giant step. We have to take baby steps,&quot; Agarwal said, referencing India&#39;s strategy of gradually reducing tariffs to temporarily protect domestic industries and boost their competitiveness.</p><p>TRADE BALANCE WITH THE U.S.</p><p>Referring to Trump&#39;s concerns about the high U.S. trade imbalance with India, Agarwal said average tariffs on goods imported from the United States, are relatively low, and imports, especially of crude oil and liquefied natural gas, could increase this year.</p><p>&quot;Duty is not an issue in the oil sector. One (Indian) rupee per metric ton is the rate of duty on import of crude,&quot; he said, suggesting that U.S. crude could become more attractive for India as supplies from Russia face increased sanctions.</p><p>India&#39;s trade surplus with the U.S., estimated at $35 billion in 2023/24, has been a highly contentious point following Trump&#39;s earlier threat of imposing tariffs over India&#39;s high levies.</p><p>India&#39;s crude oil and LNG imports from the U.S., estimated at about $6.5 billion in 2023/24 fiscal year ending March, out of a total $42 billion imports, could increase after the U.S. sanctions on Russia&#39;s oil companies and China&#39;s retaliatory tariffs on energy imports from the U.S., analysts said.</p><p>&quot;We got better prices from Russia. But the situation may change,&quot; Agarwal said adding the trade imbalance could be &quot;corrected.&quot;</p><p>India&#39;s top 30 import items from the U.S., such as oil products and diamonds, all fall within low tariff category, with rates ranging from 3% on airplanes to 7.5% on petrochemicals, he said, indicating items where imports could potentially increase.</p><p>(Reporting by Manoj Kumar and Nikunj Ohri; Editing by Kim Coghill)</p></div></article></div>",

            "summary": "India plans to review import tariffs on over 30 items, including luxury cars, solar cells and chemicals, a senior finance ministry official said, potentially leading to increased imports from the United States as global trade tensions grow.  The move, aimed at reducing average tariffs, comes ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the U.S. next week.  In a bid to avoid President Donald Trump's growing tariff actions, India has already reduced average import tariff rates to 11% from 13% on several items in the latest budget.",
