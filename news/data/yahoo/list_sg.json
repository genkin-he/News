and environmental risks, Washington-based global security nonprofit C4ADS has said in a report.</p><p>According to the report, Indonesia&#39;s 8 million metric ton refining capacity was distributed across 33 companies, but ownership tracing showed shareholder overlap, and ultimately Chinese companies controlled about three-quarters of smelting capacity as of 2023.</p><p>&quot;As Indonesia aims to use the nickel industry for economic growth, this substantial foreign influence could limit its ability to control and shape the industry for its benefit,&quot; said the report, released on Tuesday.</p><p>The reliance on Chinese-controlled nickel production also places U.S. and European automakers at a competitive disadvantage in the global EV market amid increasingly restrictive policies against trade with China, the report said. Nickel is a key battery component.</p><p>Indonesia&#39;s mining ministry did not immediately comment.</p><p>An Indonesian official said last year that Chinese companies were approaching Indonesian and South Korean firms for potential partnerships to reduce their stakes in smelters and make their product more accessible to the U.S. market.</p><p>President Prabowo Subianto formed a task force to develop the downstream mineral industry with domestic financing to &quot;gradually reduce perception that foreigners got the most benefits,&quot; Mining Minister Bahlil Lahadalia said last month.</p><p>The C4ADS report found that two Chinese companies, Tsingshan Holding Group and Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry Co Ltd, accounted for more than 70% of Indonesia&#39;s refining capacity as of 2023.</p><p>The two were among the earliest investors when Indonesia started a push for domestic processing of nickel ore - a move that has made it the world&#39;s dominant producer.</p><p>Last year, a court in Central Sulawesi sentenced two workers at Indonesia Tsingshan Stainless Steel to seven months jail for negligence that led to a fire and deaths at a Tsingshan facility in December 2023. In early 2023, two workers were killed in clashes at the PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry smelter in North Morowali owned by Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Tsingshan&#39;s unit Eternal Tsingshan and Jiangsu Delong&#39;s joint-venture Obsidian Stainless Steel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

the 49th hereditary imam of the Ismaili sect of Shia Islam.</p><p>The Swiss-born philanthropist was bequeathed the title of Aga Khan aged 20 by his grandfather, who skipped the line of succession for the first time since the seventh century to appoint a &quot;young man&quot; of the &quot;new age&quot;.</p><p>He was the son of a British socialite and a playboy ambassador for Pakistan, who became known for having a string of high-profile lovers that landed him in the diary columns of glossy magazines.</p><p>The Aga Khan went on to have a jetset lifestyle himself marked by private planes, yachts, skiing in the Winter Olympics, and a marriage to a British model, with whom he had three children.</p><p>They later divorced and he married German singer Gabriele Thyssen, with whom he had a son.</p><p>During the divorce case, French judges had difficulty estimating the Aga Khan&#39;s wealth, because of a rare fiscal privilege that allows him to pay taxes in Switzerland, despite living in France.</p><p>- Leave a &#39;better world&#39; -</p><p>Fuelled by his enormous wealth, he launched an apolitical secular development foundation in 1967 credited with raising literacy levels in 18 countries across South and Central Asia, Africa and the Middle East.</p><p>Its work in Pakistan earned the Aga Khan the wrath of Sunni Taliban militants who accused the foundation&#39;s schools of &quot;brainwashing&quot; men and women to stay away from Islam.</p><p>In his youth he had dreamed of becoming an architect, before graduating instead from Harvard University with a degree in Islamic history.</p><p>He has also pursued a goal of educating the world about the richness of Muslim culture.</p><p>&quot;I was born with Islamic ethics in a Muslim family.

gunman -- were killed at an education centre in the city of Orebro, with many questions still unanswered.</p><p>Several media reported the suspected gunman turned his gun on himself -- but police would not confirm those reports.</p><p>&quot;Eleven people are dead, including the killer,&quot; police told AFP about Tuesday&#39;s massacre at Campus Risbergska, a secondary school for young adults.</p><p>Police did not comment on the number of wounded nor how serious those were but the southern Orebro region said on Tuesday that six people suffering from gunshot wounds were taken to hospital.</p><p>&quot;This is the worst mass shooting in Swedish history,&quot; Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson told a press conference late on Tuesday.</p><p>Kristersson noted a lot of &quot;questions were still unanswered&quot;.</p><p>&quot;But there will come a time when we will know what happened, how it could happen and what motives may have been behind it,&quot; Kristersson said, urging people not to &quot;speculate&quot;.</p><p>&quot;The motive for the shooting is not yet known, but all the indications are that the perpetrator acted alone, without ideological motive,&quot; Orebro police said in a statement.</p><p>Police have not disclosed any information about the identity or ages of the dead, nor whether they were students or teachers at the school.</p><p>School attacks are relatively rare in Sweden, but the country has suffered shootings and bombings linked to gang violence that kill dozens of people each year.</p><p>&quot;The perpetrator is not known to the police, he has no gang affiliations, we believe there will be no further attacks,&quot; Orebro police chief Roberto Eid Forest told reporters on Tuesday evening.</p><p>- &#39;Blood everywhere&#39; -</p><p>Swedish television channel TV4 meanwhile reported that police had raided the suspect&#39;s home in Orebro late on Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>It said the suspect was around 35 years old and had a license to carry a weapon and no criminal record, but did not provide any details about his identity.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The man lived reclusively, was unemployed, and had distanced himself from his family and friends, newspaper Aftonbladet reported, citing family members.</p><p>The shooting occurred around midday on Tuesday.</p><p>&quot;I was standing there, watching what was happening, and I was just around here when I saw some bodies lying on the ground. I don&#39;t know if they were dead or injured,&quot; 16-year-old Linn, who goes to school near the site of the massacre, told an AFP correspondent at the scene.</p><p>&quot;There was blood everywhere, people were panicking and crying, parents were worried... it was chaos,&quot; she added, her voice trembling.</p><p>Two Campus Risbergska teachers, Miriam Jarlevall and Patrik Soderman, told newspaper Dagens Nyheter they heard gunfire in a hallway.</p><p>&quot;Students came and said someone was shooting. Then we heard more shooting in the hallway. We didn&#39;t go out, we hid in our offices,&quot; they said.</p><p>&quot;There were a lot of gunshots at first and then it was quiet for a half-hour and then it started again. We were lying under our desks, cowering.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;Dark hour&#39; -</p><p>Sweden&#39;s King Carl XVI Gustaf said in a statement that he had received the news of the shooting with &quot;sadness and dismay&quot;.</p><p>European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen described the event as &quot;truly horrifying&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Such violence and terror have no place in our societies -- least of all in schools. In this dark hour, we stand with the people of Sweden,&quot; she said in a post on X.</p><p>Though such shootings are rare, several other violent incidents have struck Swedish schools in recent years.</p><p>In March 2022, an 18-year-old student stabbed two teachers to death at a secondary school in the southern city of Malmo.</p><p>Two months earlier, a 16-year-old was arrested after wounding another student and a teacher with a knife at a school in the small town of Kristianstad.</p><p>In October 2015, three people were killed in a racially motivated attack at a school in the western town of Trollhattan by a sword-wielding assailant who was later killed by police.</p><p>bur-ef/jll/bc</p></div></article></div>",

(Idrees MOHAMMED)</figcaption></div></figure><p>India&#39;s Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a ritual river dip on Wednesday at the world&#39;s largest religious festival, a week after a stampede killed at least 30 pilgrims.</p><p>Many millions of people have already bathed in the confluence of rivers at the Kumbh Mela, a six-week-long Hindu celebration of prayer and bathing held every 12 years.</p><p>Modi, dressed in a saffron-coloured top and counting prayer beads in his hands, waded out thigh-deep to the holiest site of the Sangam, the meeting point of the Ganges, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati rivers.</p><p>He then dunked his head under the waters several times, watched by vast crowds packed along the river banks in the&nbsp;north Indian city of Prayagraj, in Utter Pradesh state.</p><p>Modi said he was &quot;blessed&quot; to take part, calling it a &quot;moment of divine connection&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Like the tens of millions of others who have taken part in it, I was also filled with a spirit of devotion,&quot; he added in a statement.</p><p>Hindus believe that those who immerse themselves in the waters cleanse themselves of sin, breaking free from the cycle of rebirth and ultimately attaining salvation.</p><p>Organisers say the scale of the Kumbh Mela is that of a temporary country, boasting that as many as 400 million pilgrims are expected to attend.</p><p>Last month, at least 30 people were killed and many more injured after a surging crowd spilt out of a police cordon and trampled bystanders.</p><p>More than 380 million people have so far taken a dip in the rivers during the festival, which began last month and runs until February 26, according to state government figures.</p><p>Modi was accompanied by Yogi Adityanath, a hardline Hindu monk and Uttar Pradesh state chief minister, a key figure in the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).</p><p>Yogi&#39;s successful management of the mega event was seen as a critical test for the 52-year-old firebrand leader, viewed as a potential eventual successor to Modi, 74.</p><p>But the deadly stampede on January 29 took the sheen off Yogi and his government&#39;s claims touting the stellar management of the event promoted on billboards across the city.</p><p>Modi&#39;s visit to the Kumbh coincides with state elections in the capital New Delhi, where the BJP is the main challenger to the incumbent Aam Aadmi Party, led by charismatic Arvind Kejriwal.</p><p>bb/pjm/dhw</p></div></article></div>",

and China (WANG Zhao)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Asian markets stumbled Wednesday and gold hit a new record as investors kept tabs on China and the United States after they exchanged tariffs, sparking fears of another debilitating trade war between the economic superpowers.</p><p>Shanghai, which reopened after a week-long break, and Hong Kong were among the main losers as e-commerce firms took a hit from news that the US Postal Service was suspending inbound parcels from China and Hong Kong.</p><p>The tepid performance came despite a positive lead from Wall Street, where there was a sigh of relief that US President Donald Trump had reached a deal to delay 25 percent duties on imports from Canada and Mexico.</p><p>Disappointing earnings from Google-parent Alphabet and Advanced Micro Devices added to the unease over the tech sector, which has already been roiled by the unveiling of a new chatbot by Chinese startup DeepSeek.</p><p>All eyes were on Washington and Beijing after they renewed their trade spat, though analysts said China&#39;s apparently more measured approach provided some hope that a full-blown crisis could be avoided.</p><p>&quot;Regarding China&#39;s counter measures, we think that the tariffs are less than what we had expected in our view. The move is largely symbolic given that only about 12% of total imports from the US would be subject to tariffs,&quot; said Kai Wang, Asia equity market strategist at Morningstar.</p><p>&quot;A key takeaway from this development, at least for now, is that fundamentally there is less risk implied than expected before.</p><p>&quot;However, escalation of the trade war remains a risk given Trump&#39;s history of unpredictable behaviour. Therefore, the volatility risk remains on the table for the next four years at least,&quot; he added.</p><p>Economists at HSBC Global Research added that China&#39;s &quot;moves so far are more measured compared with the universal 10 percent tariff imposed by the US, suggesting a likely different playbook than a tit-for-tat strategy, though we acknowledge the risk of escalation has increased&quot;.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Hong Kong fell more than one percent, with e-commerce giant JD.com sinking nearly four percent and rival Alibaba also lower on news of the US Postal Service suspension.</p><p>Trump&#39;s tariff announcement against China included the removal of an allowance -- used by China&#39;s e-commerce firms -- that exempted small packages worth less than $800 from duties. The suspension does not involve letters and flat mail.</p><p>Shanghai dropped as it reopened after a week-long break, while Singapore, Wellington, Mumbai, Bangkok and Jakarta also retreated, though Sydney, Seoul, Taipei and Manila rose.</p><p>Tokyo reversed earlier losses, though Nissan dived 4.9 percent after Japan&#39;s Nikkei business daily said the carmaker had decided to withdraw from merger talks with rival Honda. Shares in Honda surged more than eight percent.</p><p>Gold hit a fresh peak of $2,861.93 as investors rushed into the safe-haven metal.</p><p>Tech firms were also under pressure after Alphabet sank 7.5 percent in after-hours trade in New York owing to disappointment at its lower-than-expected revenue growth and its ambitious 2025 capital spending forecast.</p><p>Advanced Micro Devices also sank in post-close business.</p><p>The tech sector has been feeling some pain since DeepSeek&#39;s arrival on the scene with its chatbot, which apparently was developed at a fraction of the cost of similar tools made by US firms, stoking concerns about the eye-watering investments made in AI in recent years.</p><p>On currency markets, the yen strengthened against the dollar following data showing nominal wages in Japan rose far more than expected last month and at the fastest pace since 1997.</p><p>That firmed expectations the country&#39;s central bank would continue to hike interest rates this year.</p><p>- Key figures around 0710 GMT -</p><p>Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 0.1 percent to 38,831.48 (close)</p><p>Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: DOWN 1.1 percent to 20,570.56</p><p>Shanghai - Composite: DOWN 0.7 percent to 3,229.49 (close)</p><p>Euro/dollar: UP at $1.0386 from $1.0383&nbsp;on Tuesday</p><p>Pound/dollar: UP at $1.2481 from $1.2480</p><p>Dollar/yen: DOWN at 153.17 yen from 154.32 yen</p><p>Euro/pound: UP at 83.22 pence from 83.16 pence</p><p>West Texas Intermediate: FLAT at $72.68 per barrel</p><p>Brent North Sea Crude: DOWN 0.2 percent at $76.08 per barrel</p><p>New York - Dow: UP 0.3&nbsp;percent at 44,556.04 (close)</p><p>London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.2 percent at 8,570.77&nbsp;(close)</p><p>dan/sco</p></div></article></div>",
