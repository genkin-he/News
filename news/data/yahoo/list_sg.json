in a shooting at an adult education centre in the central city of Orebro.</p><p>Several media reported the suspected gunman turned his gun on himself -- but police have not confirmed those reports.</p><p>&quot;Eleven people are dead, including the killer,&quot; police told AFP about Tuesday&#39;s massacre at Campus Risbergska, a secondary school for young adults.</p><p>Local health authorities said Wednesday six people were being treated at Orebro&#39;s university hospital.</p><p>Five of them -- three women and two men -- had undergone surgery for gunshot wounds and were in a &quot;stable but serious&quot; condition.</p><p>A woman was also being treated for minor injuries, Orebro County authorities said in a statement, adding that all the injured were over the age of 18.</p><p>&quot;This is the worst mass shooting in Swedish history,&quot; Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson told a press conference late on Tuesday.</p><p>Kristersson noted a lot of &quot;questions were still unanswered&quot;.</p><p>&quot;But there will come a time when we will know what happened, how it could happen and what motives may have been behind it,&quot; Kristersson said, urging people not to &quot;speculate&quot;.</p><p>&quot;The motive for the shooting is not yet known, but all the indications are that the perpetrator acted alone, without ideological motive,&quot; Orebro police said in a statement.</p><p>Police have not disclosed any information about the identity or ages of the dead, nor whether they were students or teachers at the school.</p><p>School attacks are relatively rare in Sweden, but the country has suffered shootings and bombings linked to gang violence that kill dozens of people each year.</p><p>&quot;The perpetrator is not known to the police, he has no gang affiliations. We believe there will be no further attacks,&quot; Orebro police chief Roberto Eid Forest told reporters on Tuesday evening.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>- &#39;Numb, speechless&#39; -</p><p>Swedish television channel TV4 reported that police had raided the suspect&#39;s home in Orebro late on Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>It said the suspect was around 35 years old and had a license to carry a weapon and no criminal record, but did not provide any details about his identity.</p><p>The man lived reclusively, was unemployed, and had distanced himself from his family and friends, newspaper Aftonbladet reported, citing family members.</p><p>The shooting struck around midday on Tuesday.</p><p>&quot;I was standing there, watching what was happening, and I was just around here when I saw some bodies lying on the ground. I don&#39;t know if they were dead or injured,&quot; 16-year-old Linn, who goes to school near the site of the massacre, told an AFP correspondent at the scene.</p><p>&quot;There was blood everywhere, people were panicking and crying, parents were worried... it was chaos,&quot; she added, her voice trembling.</p><p>Liv Demir, 36, whose son attends a school near the Campus Risbergska, said she was shocked to hear of the shooting.</p><p>&quot;I became numb, speechless. I didn&#39;t really know where to go,&quot; she told AFP on Wednesday morning.</p><p>Her son also has gym classes at Campus Risbergska.</p><p>&quot;So my thoughts were spiralling because I packed his sports bag in the morning,&quot; Demir said.</p><p>- &#39;Dark hour&#39; -</p><p>Sweden&#39;s King Carl XVI Gustaf said in a statement Tuesday that he had received the news of the shooting with &quot;sadness and dismay.&quot;</p><p>The Royal Court announced Wednesday that flags would be &quot;flown at half-mast at all royal palaces&quot; during the day. The government announced a similar measure for its own offices and parliament.</p><p>European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen described the shooting as &quot;truly horrifying&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Such violence and terror have no place in our societies -- least of all in schools. In this dark hour, we stand with the people of Sweden,&quot; she said in a post on X.</p><p>Though such shootings are rare, several other violent incidents have struck Swedish schools in recent years.</p><p>In March 2022, an 18-year-old student stabbed two teachers to death at a secondary school in the southern city of Malmo.</p><p>Two months earlier, a 16-year-old was arrested after wounding another student and a teacher with a knife at a school in the small town of Kristianstad.</p><p>In October 2015, three people were killed in a racially motivated attack at a school in the western town of Trollhattan by a sword-wielding assailant who was later killed by police.</p><p>bur-ef/jll/nl/rlp</p></div></article></div>",

fallen out spectacularly with the country&#39;s leader, paving the way for a Senate trial that could see her removed from office.</p><p>While specifics of the impeachment were not divulged, the vote follows the filing of a trio of complaints in December accusing Duterte of crimes ranging from the &quot;brazen misuse&quot; of millions of dollars in public funds to plotting President Ferdinand Marcos&#39;s assassination.</p><p>&quot;Having been filed by more than one-third of the membership of the House of Representatives, or a total of 215 members ... the motion is approved,&quot; House Speaker Martin Romualdez told lawmakers.</p><p>The fate of Duterte, daughter of the former president, now lies in the hands of the Philippines&#39; 24 senators, two-thirds of whom must vote for her impeachment to remove her from office and disqualify her from future public positions. A trial date has yet to be set.</p><p>Wednesday&#39;s filing comes days before campaigning officially begins for mid-term elections, widely expected to set the table for the 2028 presidential race.</p><p>Whether 16 senators cast their vote for Duterte&#39;s impeachment could come down to President Marcos, Dennis Coronacion, chairman of the political science department at the University of Santo Tomas, told AFP.</p><p>&quot;If (Marcos) is committed to this one, to the impeachment process ... I think getting the required number of Senate votes is possible,&quot; he said, adding Wednesday&#39;s vote had come as something of a surprise.</p><p>But should the administration stay hands-off, the chances of Duterte being impeached are closer to 50-50, Coronacion said, pointing to the sitting senators&#39; need for votes from Duterte stronghold Mindanao in the coming election.</p><p>- Family feud -</p><p>The relationship between Duterte and President Marcos is at a nadir, their former alliance giving way to a months-long public battle that has seen the trading of wild accusations, including an alleged death threat that remains under investigation.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>But Marcos had previously urged Congress not to pursue Duterte&#39;s impeachment, calling it a &quot;storm in a teacup&quot; that would distract the legislature from its primary responsibilities.</p><p>Marcos&#39;s executive secretary Lucas Bersamin, however, said Monday that the Office of the President would &quot;not interfere&quot; with the impeachment complaints.</p><p>A public relations official told AFP the Senate was expecting the articles of impeachment to arrive at its security office around 7:00 pm.</p><p>House of Representatives member Percival Cendana, who had backed one of the three impeachment complaints, urged his colleagues to take quick action at a rally on Friday that drew thousands calling for Duterte&#39;s impeachment.</p><p>Every day of inaction &quot;condones the impunity, the abuse of power and the harassment that Duterte is doing to our country&#39;s leaders&quot;, he told reporters.</p><p>But that rally was dwarfed by one a conservative sect organised that drew hundreds of thousands to the street on January 13 opposing the vice president&#39;s impeachment.</p><p>Duterte was widely tipped to succeed her father Rodrigo as president in 2022 elections but stepped aside to back Marcos and later ran for vice president on his ticket.</p><p>But the alliance has since imploded. In November, she delivered an expletive-laden speech saying she had ordered someone to kill Marcos if she herself was assassinated.</p><p>She later denied that her comments constituted a death threat, saying she had only been expressing &quot;consternation&quot; with the administration&#39;s failures.</p><p>The alleged assassination threat was among the allegations included in the last of the three complaints filed against Duterte, lodged December 19 by&nbsp;seven Manila-based Catholic priests.</p><p>With her impeachment, Duterte becomes one of only four high-ranking officials to share that fate since the Philippines returned to democracy after the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos Sr came to an end in 1986.</p><p>Along with a Supreme Court justice and a high-profile prosecutor, then-president Joseph Estrada was impeached in November 2000 on charges of embezzlement and taking kickbacks from illegal gambling operations.</p><p>When the Senate tribunal refused to accept key evidence, Filipinos took to the streets in a bloodless revolt, leading Estrada to step down when the military withdrew its support.</p><p>cgm/pam/cwl/mtp</p></div></article></div>",

It is also the farthest destination so far for such flights using a military aircraft.</p><p>Reuters reported on Tuesday that the C-17 aircraft with migrants on board had departed for India but would not arrive for at least 24 hours.

and China (WANG Zhao)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Equity markets stumbled Wednesday and gold hit a new record as investors kept tabs on China and the United States after they exchanged tariffs, sparking fears of another debilitating trade war between the economic superpowers.</p><p>Shanghai, which reopened after a week-long break, and Hong Kong were among the main losers as e-commerce firms took a hit from news that the US Postal Service was suspending inbound parcels from China and Hong Kong.</p><p>The tepid performance came despite a positive lead from Wall Street, where there was a sigh of relief that US President Donald Trump had reached a deal to delay 25 percent duties on imports from Canada and Mexico.</p><p>Disappointing earnings from Google-parent Alphabet and Advanced Micro Devices added to the unease over the tech sector, which has already been roiled by the unveiling of a new chatbot by Chinese startup DeepSeek.</p><p>All eyes were on Washington and Beijing after they renewed their trade spat, though analysts said China&#39;s apparently more measured approach provided some hope that a full-blown crisis could be avoided.</p><p>China on Wednesday expressed its &quot;resolute opposition&quot; to US tariffs on its exports and called for &quot;dialogue&quot; to resolve trade differences.</p><p>Kai Wang, Asia equity market strategist at Morningstar, said: &quot;Regarding China&#39;s counter measures, we think that the tariffs are less than what we had expected in our view. The move is largely symbolic given that only about 12% of total imports from the US would be subject to tariffs.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A key takeaway from this development, at least for now, is that fundamentally there is less risk implied than expected before,&quot; he added.</p><p>&quot;However, escalation of the trade war remains a risk given Trump&#39;s history of unpredictable behaviour. Therefore, the volatility risk remains on the table for the next four years at least,&quot; he said.</p><p>Economists at HSBC Global Research added that China&#39;s &quot;moves so far are more measured compared with the universal 10 percent tariff imposed by the US, suggesting a likely different playbook than a tit-for-tat strategy, though we acknowledge the risk of escalation has increased&quot;.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Hong Kong fell about one percent, with e-commerce giant JD.com sinking nearly four percent and rival Alibaba also lower on news of the US Postal Service suspension.</p><p>Trump&#39;s tariff announcement against China included the removal of an allowance -- used by China&#39;s e-commerce firms -- that exempted small packages worth less than $800 from duties. The suspension does not involve letters and flat mail.</p><p>Shanghai dropped as it reopened after a week-long break, while Singapore, Wellington, Mumbai, Bangkok and Jakarta also retreated, though Sydney, Seoul, Taipei and Manila rose.</p><p>Tokyo reversed earlier losses, though Nissan dived 4.9 percent after Japan&#39;s Nikkei business daily and other media said the carmaker had decided to withdraw from merger talks with rival Honda.</p><p>The losses came before trading in the firm was suspended by&nbsp;the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which said the reports needed to be verified.</p><p>Shares in Honda ended up 8.2 percent, having soared nearly 12 percent at one point.</p><p>London,&nbsp;Paris and Frankfurt all fell at the open.</p><p>Gold hit a fresh peak above $2,866 as investors rushed into the safe-haven metal.</p><p>Tech firms were also under pressure after Alphabet sank 7.5 percent in after-hours trade in New York owing to disappointment at its lower-than-expected revenue growth and its ambitious 2025 capital spending forecast.</p><p>Advanced Micro Devices also sank in post-close business.</p><p>The tech sector has been feeling some pain since DeepSeek&#39;s arrival on the scene with its chatbot, which apparently was developed at a fraction of the cost of similar tools made by US firms, stoking concerns about the eye-watering investments made in AI in recent years.</p><p>On currency markets, the yen strengthened against the dollar following data showing nominal wages in Japan rose far more than expected last month and at the fastest pace since 1997.</p><p>That firmed expectations the country&#39;s central bank would continue to hike interest rates this year.</p><p>- Key figures around 0815 GMT -</p><p>Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 0.1 percent to 38,831.48 (close)</p><p>Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: DOWN 0.9 percent to 20,597.09 (close)</p><p>Shanghai - Composite: DOWN 0.7 percent to 3,229.49 (close)</p><p>London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.1 percent at 8,563.28</p><p>Euro/dollar: UP at $1.0399 from $1.0383&nbsp;on Tuesday</p><p>Pound/dollar: UP at $1.2498 from $1.2480</p><p>Dollar/yen: DOWN at 153.28 yen from 154.32 yen</p><p>Euro/pound: UP at 83.24 pence from 83.16 pence</p><p>West Texas Intermediate: DOWN 0.4 percent at $72.44 per barrel</p><p>Brent North Sea Crude: DOWN 0.5 percent at $75.84 per barrel</p><p>New York - Dow: UP 0.3&nbsp;percent at 44,556.04 (close)</p><p>dan/sco</p></div></article></div>",

SOTHY)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Wild monkeys egged on by YouTubers have been rampaging at Cambodia&#39;s famed Angkor Wat complex, attacking tourists, wrecking temple stonework and damaging information boards, officials said Wednesday.</p><p>The agency that runs the UNESCO-listed site warned visitors to steer clear of the growing gangs of &quot;aggressive&quot; macaques that live around the sprawling complex of ruins and have been biting tourists.</p><p>The macaques are native to the lush forests that surround Angkor Wat, but Apsara National Authority said human interaction -- particularly by people filming content to post online -- had changed their behaviour.</p><p>A small number of YouTubers regularly fed monkeys to create videos and this has &quot;changed the monkeys&#39; natural behaviour from being wild animals to domestic ones that are aggressive, steal foods, and cause injuries among people&quot;, it said in a statement.</p><p>Some have reportedly even filmed themselves abusing macaques.</p><p>Long Kosal, a spokesman for the Apsara National Authority, told AFP that as well as the danger posed to tourists, the agency was increasingly worried about the monkeys damaging the centuries-old stonework.</p><p>&quot;On top of biting visitors, they have been climbing up and pushing stones down, damaging temples,&quot; he said, adding that the macaques had also damaged information boards.</p><p>The agency has urged tourists to leave the monkeys alone while visiting the ruins, and said it is looking for &quot;an appropriate solution&quot; to the problem.</p><p>Angkor Wat, built from the 9th to the 15th centuries, was the capital of the Khmer Empire and is Cambodia&#39;s top tourist attraction, bringing in valuable revenue to a poor country.</p><p>More than a million foreign tourists visited the park last year.</p><p>Since it became a world heritage site in 1992, Angkor Wat and the surrounding jungle have benefited from increased legal and physical protections.</p><p>There are hopes that wildlife sightings will also spark interest in local and foreign tourists and boost conservation education efforts.</p><p>Last year, the agricultural ministry announced a plan to conduct a census of monkeys in public areas and to identify and relocate those posing a danger to humans.</p><p>suy/pdw/dhw</p></div></article></div>",
