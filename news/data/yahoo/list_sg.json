granted his freedom.</p><p>Indonesia, which has some of the world&#39;s toughest drug laws, has in recent weeks released half a dozen high-profile detainees, including a Filipina mother on death row and the last five members of the so-called &quot;Bali Nine&quot; drug ring.</p><p>Serge Atlaoui, 61,&nbsp; will be driven from Salemba prison in Jakarta to the city&#39;s main airport in a convoy before being handed over to French police officers and boarding a commercial flight to Paris, due to arrive Wednesday morning.</p><p>Upon arrival, &quot;he will be taken to Bobigny (a suburb of Paris), presented to prosecutors and most likely detained while awaiting a decision on the adaptation (of his sentence)&quot;, his lawyer Richard Sedillot told AFP.</p><p>Then &quot;in the coming weeks or months&quot; the lawyer will request that a French court &quot;adapt his sentence to grant his freedom&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Serge is happy and calm&quot;, added Sedillot, &quot;but he is going to need a little bit of time to reorganise himself&quot;.</p><p>France requested his return officially on November 4 and it was made possible after an agreement between the French Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin and his Indonesian counterpart Yusril Ihza Mahendra on January 24.</p><p>In the agreement, Jakarta said they had decided &quot;not to execute the prisoner&quot; and authorised his return on &quot;humanitarian grounds&quot; because &quot;he is ill&quot;.</p><p>Atlaoui has been receiving weekly medical treatment at a nearby hospital.</p><p>Jakarta also left it to the French government to grant Atlaoui -- the only Frenchman on death row in Indonesia -- &quot;clemency, amnesty or a reduced sentence&quot;.</p><p>- Death penalty appeal -</p><p>Atlaoui was arrested in 2005 at a factory in a Jakarta suburb where tens of kilos of drugs were discovered and accused of being a &quot;chemist&quot; by the authorities.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button

four has always denied being a drug trafficker, saying that he was installing machinery in what he thought was&nbsp;an acrylic factory.</p><p>&quot;I thought there was something suspicious (about the factory),&quot; Atlaoui told AFP in 2015.</p><p>Initially sentenced to life in prison, his sentence was reviewed by the supreme court and changed to death on appeal.</p><p>He was due to be executed alongside eight others in 2015, but was granted a reprieve after Paris applied more pressure and the Indonesian authorities allowed an outstanding appeal to proceed.</p><p>There are currently at least 530 inmates on death row in Indonesia, according to the human rights organisation Kontas, referencing official figures.</p><p>Among them 90 foreigners, including at least one woman, according to the Ministry of Immigration and Correction.</p><p>The Indonesian government recently signalled it will resume executions, on hiatus since 2016.</p><p>In December, Filipina inmate Mary Jane Veloso, who was arrested in 2010 and also sentenced to death for drug trafficking, was returned to her home country after an agreement was reached between both countries.</p><p>ebe/tc/stu</p></div></article></div>",

class=caas-body><p>By Lucy Raitano</p><p>LONDON (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence bulls in Europe are dusting off a 160-year-old economic theory to explain why the boom in the sector&#39;s stocks may have further to run, despite the emergence of China&#39;s cheap AI model DeepSeek.</p><p>Tech stocks worldwide plunged on Jan. 27 after the launch of DeepSeek - apparently costing a fraction of rival AI models and requiring less sophisticated chips - raised questions over the West&#39;s huge investments in chipmakers and data centres.</p><p>At the heart of the selloff was U.S. advanced chipmaker and AI poster-child Nvidia, which lost 17% of its value, or close to $600 billion, in the largest one-day drop in market capitalisation for any company on record.</p><p>Since then, tech stocks have rebounded, with European markets hitting new highs, and a 19th century economic theory is suddenly on everyone&#39;s lips: the Jevons Paradox.</p><p>Named after English economist William Stanley Jevons, it posits that when a resource becomes more efficient to use, demand can increase - rather than decrease - as the price to use the resource drops.</p><p>&quot;I hadn’t discussed it until Monday (last week), and then suddenly it’s everywhere,&quot; said Helen Jewell, Chief Investment Officer at BlackRock Fundamental Equities, EMEA.</p><p>&quot;This paradox highlights one of the uncertainties at the moment,&quot; said Jewell, flagging that a key question for European stock-pickers is whether data centres and their suppliers will be less in demand.</p><p>&quot;One of the big question marks from (last) Monday’s news is how much energy is going to be needed for the AI revolution?&quot;</p><p>The selloff hit direct and indirect AI plays alike. Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML, and sector peers ASMI and BE Semi all fell 7%-12% on Jan. 27, before recouping losses later in the week, as did Siemens Energy, which provides hardware for AI infrastructure.</p><p>&quot;Jevons Paradox strikes again!&quot; Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said in a post on X.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;As AI gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can&#39;t get enough of.&quot;</p><p>THE NEW BUZZWORD</p><p>On Friday, Tomasz Godziek, portfolio manager of the Tech Disruptors fund at J. Safra Sarasin Sustainable Asset Management, said lower AI costs could exemplify the Jevons Paradox.</p><p>&quot;Ultimately, this could fuel a new wave of AI investment, creating fresh opportunities, particularly in software and inference technologies,&quot; Godziek said.</p><p>Portfolio managers at Thematics Asset Management, an affiliate of Natixis IM, cited Jevons Paradox as one reason they believe demand for AI chips may remain healthy.</p><p>Mark Hawtin, head of the Liontrust global equities team, also said his investment thesis on AI was reinforced by the news on Jan. 27, flagging the paradox.</p><p>&quot;Everyone has become an expert on Jevons Paradox,&quot; said Aviva Investors portfolio manager Kunal Kothari, who manages a UK equity income fund with around 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) in assets.</p><p>&quot;The falling cost of improved productivity through GenAI will likely benefit companies in the UK market generally, as they will predominantly be consumers of these technologies,&quot; he added, pointing to data and software names like RELX, LSEG, Experian and Sage as likely beneficiaries.</p><p>DATA CENTRE NEEDS IN FOCUS</p><p>The need for data centres and the vast amounts of power required to run them has driven a lot of AI investing in Europe already, given that there aren&#39;t any homegrown rivals to the likes of Nvidia, whose shares have rocketed by about 200% in under two years.</p><p>&quot;There is an implicit assumption that the adoption and usage of AI would require increasingly more chips, and more data centre capacity and power consumption,&quot; said Kasper Elmgreen, CIO of fixed income and equities at Nordea Asset Management.</p><p>&quot;What DeepSeek has done is to question what is required from that route and what can be delivered by making much better software.&quot;</p><p>Not everyone is convinced of the new rationale, including Jordan Rochester, head of FICC strategy at Mizuho EMEA.</p><p>&quot;Whilst many Nvidia optimists pointed to Jevons Paradox to help them sleep better at night ... it was less convincing in the short term after what has been a meteoric rise in Nvidia shares,&quot; he wrote in a note.</p><p>($1 = 0.8122 pounds)</p><p>(Reporting by Lucy Raitano.

eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.</p><p>M23 fighters and Rwandan soldiers have made substantial gains in the eastern DRC, taking the major city of Goma last week, and have vowed to march across the vast country to the capital Kinshasa.</p><p>With tensions spiralling, Tshisekedi has promised a &quot;vigorous&quot; military response and urged the international community to impose sanctions on Rwanda.</p><p>Tshisekedi and Kagame will join a two-day joint summit of eastern and southern African countries due to begin on Friday in Tanzania, Kenya&#39;s said Monday. Kenya holds the rotating presidency of the East African Community.</p><p>Both leaders have been no-shows at previous talks attempting to broker peace between the two sides.</p><p>The lightning offensive is the latest escalation in a region devastated by decades of fighting involving dozens of armed groups, with many seeking to control its rich veins of key minerals used in technology.</p><p>The fall of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, saw deadly clashes and added to an already dire humanitarian situation.</p><p>The M23 has since advanced towards the neighbouring province of South Kivu, threatening its main city, Bukavu.</p><p>Vincent Kasali, a bean seller in Bukavu, said that trade in the city had been disrupted, especially with navigation on Lake Kivu bordering Rwanda restricted.</p><p>&quot;We hope that navigation on the lake will resume so that we can find the means to feed our children,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;We see many soldiers on the road,&quot;</p><p>A local source in Bukavu told AFP that the city &quot;remains calm for the time being&quot;.</p><p>But the source added that information suggested that the M23 &quot;is reorganising with reinforcements and arms shipments to probably go to the front now that fighting has ended in Goma&quot;.</p><p>- South Africa-Rwanda spat -</p><p>In South Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa vowed Monday to continue providing support to the DRC in the face of nationwide calls to withdraw Pretoria&#39;s troops following the death of 14 South African soldiers.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Most of the soldiers killed were part of a peacekeeping mission sent to the eastern DRC in 2023 by the 16-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC).</p><p>Amid an ongoing war of words between Ramaphosa and Kagame, Rwandan government spokeswoman Yolande Makolo reacted strongly to the South African leader&#39;s statement.</p><p>&quot;You are sending your troops to fight Tshisekedi&#39;s war to kill his own people,&quot; she said to Ramaphosa on X.</p><p>&quot;Please tell your people the truth about the personal interests in mining that you have in the DRC -- these are the interests for which, sadly, (South African army) soldiers are dying.&quot;</p><p>Kagame has said that South African troops have no place in eastern DRC and are a &quot;belligerent force engaging in offensive combat operations to help the DRC government fight against its own people&quot;.</p><p>A UN expert report said last year that Rwanda had thousands of troops in the DRC seeking to profit from the mining of rare minerals -- and that Kigali has &quot;de facto&quot; control over the M23.</p><p>Rwanda has never admitted to military involvement in support of the M23 group and alleges that the DRC supports and shelters the FDLR, an armed group created by ethnic Hutus who massacred Tutsis during the 1994 Rwandan genocide.</p><p>South Africa dominates the SADC force, which is estimated to number around 1,300 troops, but Malawi and Tanzania also contribute soldiers.</p><p>The United States announced Monday it was further reducing its staff at its embassy in Kinshasa.</p><p>At a religious gathering in Kinshasa Monday, the leader of the revival churches of DRC, Evariste Ejiba, spoke of the situation in the east to the several thousand people attending.</p><p>&quot;Within the next 72 hours, if there are no clear and targeted sanctions&quot; against Rwanda and the M23, &quot;we are going to hold marches to demand the closure of certain chancelleries&quot;.</p><p>burs-str-sbk/gv</p></div></article></div>",

of the Israeli-American alliance.&quot;</p><p>The Israeli premier had tense relations with Trump&#39;s predecessor Joe Biden over the growing death toll in Gaza, despite Biden&#39;s steadfast maintenance of US military aid.</p><p>But Trump, who has claimed credit for sealing the ceasefire after 15 months of war and prides himself on his dealmaking ability, will be pushing Netanyahu to stick to the agreement.</p><p>He is also expected to lean on Netanyahu to accept a deal to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia, something he tried to do in his first term.</p><p>- &#39;No guarantees&#39; -</p><p>Trump said Sunday that talks with Israel and other Middle Eastern countries were &quot;progressing&quot; -- but then warned less than 24 hours later that there that were &quot;no guarantees that the peace is going to hold.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Trump&#39;s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff -- who met Netanyahu on Monday over terms for the second phase of the Gaza truce -- said however that he was &quot;certainly hopeful&quot; that the truce would stick.</p><p>Hamas officials have said they were ready to begin talks on the details of the second phase, which is expected to cover the release of the remaining captives and could lead to a more permanent end to the war.</p><p>But Trump&#39;s sudden floating of a plan to move people out of Gaza -- which he describes as a &quot;demolition site&quot; -- has added further uncertainty to an already tense and difficult situation.</p><p>Trump said the plan could be temporary or permanent, but the mass displacement of civilians from Gaza was strongly rejected by Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinians, and ceasefire mediator Qatar.</p><p>Under the Gaza ceasefire&#39;s 42-day first phase, Hamas is to free 33 hostages in staggered releases in exchange for around 1,900 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.</p><p>Four hostage-prisoner exchanges have already taken place, and the truce has led to a surge of food, fuel, medical and other aid into rubble-strewn Gaza, as well as allowing displaced Gazans to return to the territory&#39;s north.</p><p>Hamas&#39;s October 2023 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p><p>Israel&#39;s retaliatory response has killed at least 47,498 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory&#39;s health ministry.</p><p>Israel has meanwhile turned its focus to the occupied West Bank and an operation it says is aimed at rooting out extremism that has killed dozens.</p><p>dk/mlm</p></div></article></div>",

of options if it wants to reply to fresh US levies.</p><p>US President Donald Trump over the weekend announced 10 percent tariffs on Chinese products, upping the stakes in a trade confrontation between the global superpowers that started eight years ago in his first term.</p><p>Beijing in response warned there were &quot;no winners&quot; in a trade war and vowed as yet unspecified countermeasures.</p><p>News that Canada and Mexico had agreed a deal with Trump to delay 25 percent tariffs on their goods was followed by his announcement that he would be holding talks with China &quot;probably in the next 24 hours&quot; to try for an agreement.</p><p>But, as the threat of new measures continues to hang over Beijing, eyes are on what officials there have lined up as a response.</p><p>With its economy still struggling with sluggish consumption and slow growth, observers expect China to keep its powder dry for now -- at least until another round of tariffs that could do greater damage.</p><p>&quot;We expect China not to jump to immediate retaliation following the 10 percent tariff hike, but will keep the doors of negotiation and cooperation open,&quot; UBS bank

Canada for a month Monday -- but China remained in the firing line for levies that are putting the global economy on edge.</p><p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau both struck last-minute deals with Trump to tighten border measures against the flow of migrants and the drug fentanyl into the United States.</p><p>Global stock markets had slumped as Trump&#39;s threat of sweeping 25 percent levies on exports from Canada and Mexico to the United States sparked fears of a global trade war.</p><p>Trump said that after &quot;very friendly&quot; talks with Sheinbaum he would &quot;immediately pause&quot; the tariffs on Mexico, and that his counterpart had agreed to send 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico frontier.</p><p>Tensions appeared higher between the United States and Canada -- but after two calls with Trudeau, Trump said on Truth Social that Canada had &quot;agreed to ensure we have a secure Northern Border, and to finally end the deadly scourge of drugs like Fentanyl.&quot;</p><p>Trudeau said Canada would deploy nearly 10,000 frontline officers to help secure the border, list drug cartels as terrorists, appoint a &quot;Fentanyl Czar&quot; and crack down on money laundering.</p><p>It was not clear the real extent of the changes on the Canadian border, given that authorities said in December they already had 8,500 personnel deployed.</p><p>-&nbsp;Stocks slump -</p><p>But China is still due to face a further 10 percent duty on top of existing levies.</p><p>The US president said last-minute talks between Washington and Beijing were due in a bid to reach an agreement.</p><p>His spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told Fox News &quot;there is a plan for him to talk to President Xi in the next 24 hours.&quot;</p><p>Canada, China and Mexico are the United States&#39;s three biggest trading partners.</p><p>Wall Street&#39;s three main indices&nbsp;fell sharply in early deals, but clawed back ground after Trump&#39;s announcement of the Mexico deal. The London, Paris and Frankfurt stock markets finished in the red.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The White House said earlier there had been a &quot;heck of a lot of talks&quot; over the weekend.</p><p>&quot;This is not a trade war, this is a drug war,&quot; National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC, complaining that &quot;the Canadians appeared to have misunderstood the plain language.&quot;</p><p>However, US government figures show that only a minimal quantity of drugs enter via Canada.</p><p>- 51st state? -</p><p>Canada had vowed to respond strongly to the tariffs.</p><p>Canadians have booed the US national anthem at sporting events, cancelled holidays in the United States and boycotted American products.</p><p>Its most populous province Ontario on Monday had banned US firms from bidding on tens of billions of dollars in government contracts -- and dumped a deal with Trump ally Elon Musk&#39;s Starlink.</p><p>Trump has upped the pressure recently by calling Canada&#39;s existence into question -- once again advocating on Monday for it to become the 51st US state.</p><p>A political crisis in the Canadian government over Trump&#39;s tariff threats led to Trudeau announcing earlier this month that he would resign too. Canadians now face elections as early as April.</p><p>Mexico has meanwhile been under heavy pressure to secure its border with the United States as Trump vows a massive crackdown on undocumented migrants.</p><p>The US president -- who has said that the word &quot;tariff&quot; is the &quot;most beautiful word in the dictionary&quot; -- is going even further in his second term on the levies than he did in his first.</p><p>He has insisted that the impact would be borne by foreign exporters without being passed on to American consumers, despite most experts saying the contrary.</p><p>But the billionaire 78-year-old did acknowledge as he returned from a weekend at his Florida resort Sunday&nbsp;that Americans might feel economic &quot;pain.&quot;</p><p>dk/jgc</p></div></article></div>",
