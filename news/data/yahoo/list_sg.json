said Tuesday that the Trump administration would review the proposal but acknowledged legal issues.</p><p>&quot;We&#39;ll have to study it on our end.

Most European nations have more leeway in revoking citizenship.</p><p>Bukele has carried a sweeping crackdown on crime that includes rounding up people without warrants.</p><p>He last year opened the &quot;Terrorism Confinement Center,&quot; or CECOT, where he has now offered to jail Americans.</p><p>Designed to house 40,000 inmates, the vast prison lies behind huge concrete walls on the edge of a jungle, with inmates allowed out of their cells only for 30 minutes a day of exercise and for virtual court appointments.</p><p>Bukele has faced criticism from human rights groups but enjoys sky-high approval ratings from a public grateful for the sharp reduction of crime in what was once one of the world&#39;s most violent countries.</p><p>Bukele, who has courted American conservatives, has offered to jail not just Americans but nationals from third countries, along with Salvadorans.</p><p>Trump quickly after taking office stripped roughly 600,000 Venezuelans in the United States of protection from deportation.</p><p>Trump&#39;s predecessor Joe Biden had refused to deport them due to the security and economic crises in Venezuela, led by leftist Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>Some 232,000 Salvadorans enjoy similar protections in the United States which Trump has not touched.</p><p>The Trump administration has also begun to fly detained migrants to the US military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</p><p>burs-sct/</p></div></article></div>",

(She did not take the offer.)</p><p>Late Sunday night, Jasmine got an email from someone in Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) telling her not to work in-person on Monday. After business hours that night, she received the same instructions via email for Tuesday.</p><p>Now Jasmine doesn’t know what’s going on. Sidelined at home, she’s disturbed by reports that Musk’s deputies are trying to enter her physical office and gain access to its systems. One of her colleagues is stranded in Nairobi without access to their work email or a way to get home.</p><p>“It’s only been two weeks. Only two and a half weeks of everything,” she said, referring to the new administration. “All of the emails are coming out very late in the day or in the middle of the night with very little warning. It’s definitely a very markedly different tone from any agency notices that have gone out prior to this time, as long as I’ve been working at USAID.”</p><p>USAID, the federal government’s primary humanitarian aid agency, is the tip of the spear in Donald Trump’s escalating war against his own government.

Most of the federal government is there by law.<span class=\"attribution\">Elaine Kamark, senior policy adviser to President Bill Clinton and lecturer at Harvard University</span></p></blockquote></div><p><span>Sarah Binder, a George Washington University political science professor and a fellow at the centrist Brookings Institute agreed that Trump is engaged in an “intense, precise effort to hoard power in the executive branch and diminish any challenges to his executive power. That’s clearly the motion and the intent coming from Trump and his advisors.”</span></p><p><span>Kevin Kosar, a senior fellow at the center-right American Enterprise Institute, said Trump is trying to foster a less liberal federal workforce — a draining of the so-called swamp that Trump promised, but did not deliver, in his first term.</span></p><p><span>“Certainly there’s this perception of — whether you call it a deep state or just a professional political class that has a liberal bent, that is embedded in the federal government,” he said. “This view holds that they direct executive branch authority in ways they see fit. That they reward organizations outside the government with grants. And that this whole kind of ‘blob’ as it’s often called is just not responsive to the people, not [responsive] to Congress — and during the first Trump administration was largely unresponsive to the president. And so this new administration is just taking a very big run at this entity.”</span></p><h2><strong>Is any of this legal?</strong></h2><p><span>That’s what we’ll find out in the weeks and months ahead, as the courts and legislative branch sort out how to respond to Trump’s sweeping mandates — while Trump’s primary tactic in the meantime is to overwhelm and confuse.</span></p><p><span>The president cannot unilaterally get rid of an agency legislated into existence by Congress. But Trump is testing the degree to which he can get around programs that aren’t protected under statute.</span></p><p><span>“I mean, much of this, on the face of it, is aptly illegal,” Kamark said. “There are rules for how you lay off people in the federal government, if you decide to do a reduction in force. You don’t decide the Education Department doesn’t exist anymore. The problem these people will face is that most of the federal government does not exist to irritate Donald Trump or any other president. Most of the federal government is there by law.”</span></p><p><span>Kosar said Trump and Republicans are snatching power in a way that could backfire once a Democrat is back in the White House.</span></p><p><span>“There’s a way to do this within the Constitution and the law. If you just rely on presidential unilateralism with a weak legal basis — congratulations, you’re creating a precedent,” Kosar said. “And the next time we have a Democrat in the White House, that’s going to be a basis for Democratic unilateral presidential action. Is that really what you want?”</span></p><p>Binder said Trump seems to have no interest in following the law and respecting the balance of powers.</p><p>“That is entirely new,” Binder said. “When all is said and done, is this effort going to be ground down the way most overreaching gets ground down in American politics” — through delay, political bottlenecks, court fights and public opposition?</p><h2><strong>What about Congress?</strong></h2><p><span>Congressional Republicans, who control both the House and Senate for the next two years, have not given much of an indication they plan to stand in Trump’s way, though some seemed uneasy with the general lack of program review.</span></p><p><span>“They’re going to see how far they can go,” </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-back-seat-trump-steamroll-congress-unilateral-moves-rcna190465\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Sen.

Schiefelbein)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Tuesday doubled-down on a sweeping freeze of most US aid, alleging that groups decrying the human impact may be deliberately trying to score political points.</p><p>But Rubio, on a Latin America tour, also said he was issuing waivers which would allow for &quot;immediate&quot; and &quot;life-saving&quot; aid to continue after President Donald Trump ordered a 90-day suspension on taking office.</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know how much more clear we can be than that,&quot; he told reporters in Costa Rica.</p><p>&quot;I would say if some organization is receiving funds from the United States and does not know how to apply a waiver, then I have real questions about the competence of that organization, or I wonder whether they&#39;re deliberately sabotaging it for purposes of making a political point,&quot; said Rubio, a former Republican senator who long voted for foreign assistance.</p><p>A day earlier, Rubio said he had been made acting head of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) as Trump looks at integrating it under the State Department.</p><p>Non-governmental organizations say they have heard multiple cases of aid groups that have struggled to operate, mostly smaller, local organizations that did not have reserves.</p><p>Others fear long-term damage in areas that go far beyond food supplies, such as education and long-term relief work.</p><p>Some schools have shuttered in Uganda, where USAID was backing a universal education program, and demining work has been disrupted in Cambodia, among other cases.</p><p>In Geneva, Jens Laerke, a spokesman for United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA, said that the Trump administration was creating a &quot;state of confusion.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;Not charity&#39; -</p><p>Elon Musk, the billionaire tech entrepreneur who advises Trump, has vowed to kill USAID, saying it is run by &quot;radical lunatics.&quot;</p><p>USAID managed more than $40 billion in the 2023 fiscal year. The United States has long been the world&#39;s top donor, with previous leaders seeing it as a key tool in increasing US influence.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Rubio, who as a senator was largely supportive of foreign assistance, said his goal was not to end aid but to narrow it to where it advances &quot;the national interest.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have long supported foreign aid.
