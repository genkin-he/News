ministry at Pragati Maidan in New Delhi</figcaption></div></figure><div class=caas-body><p>By Nikunj Ohri, Aditya Kalra and Aditi Shah</p><p>NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has accused South Korea&#39;s Kia of evading taxes of $155 million by misclassifying component imports but the carmaker has denied wrongdoing, the latest fight by a foreign automaker with New Delhi over tariffs, according to a document and two sources.</p><p>Kia competes with Hyundai and Maruti Suzuki in the world&#39;s third-largest auto market, where it has a share of 6% of roughly 4 million units a year, and its Kia Seltos and Sonet SUVs are among the top sellers.</p><p>Foreign companies in India face headaches from high taxes and long-drawn-out investigations.</p><p>For example, Tesla has publicly complained about high taxes on imported EVs and Volkswagen last week sued over a demand for a record $1.4 billion in back taxes that it called &quot;impossibly enormous&quot;.</p><p>Tax officers sent a confidential notice to Kia&#39;s Indian unit in April 2024, flagging alleged tax evasion of 13.5 billion rupees, according to a government notice Reuters is reporting for the first time.</p><p>The offence centred on incorrect declaration of imports of components for the assembly of the carmaker&#39;s luxury Carnival minivan, the notice showed.</p><p>In a statement to Reuters, Kia India said it made &quot;a detailed response, supported by comprehensive evidence and documentation to substantiate&quot; its stand and the authorities were still reviewing the matter.</p><p>Kia India is committed to complying with all regulations and has &quot;consistently cooperated with&quot; authorities, it added.</p><p>India&#39;s finance ministry and customs officials did not respond to Reuters queries.</p><p>In its 432-page notice, the government said tax authorities found Kia&#39;s Carnival &quot;car model was being imported in parts or components in separate lots&quot; via different ports, with the &quot;intent to discharge lesser customs duty&quot;.</p><p>Kia devised the strategy to ensure the imports &quot;could not (be) detected by customs,&quot; it added in the notice, issued by a customs commissioner in the southern city of Chennai.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Two sources said Kia&#39;s case was similar to that of Volkswagen, accused of evading a higher tax of 30% to 35% applicable on parts imported in &quot;completely knocked down&quot; or CKD form in a single shipment, instead shipping separate parts over days, making them eligible for a tax rate of just 10% to 15%.</p><p>During the investigation, Kia&#39;s website showed the Carnival model sold in India as being in &quot;CKD&quot; form, with retail sales of 9,887 units between 2020 and 2022, the tax notice said.</p><p>The Volkswagen investigation spanned 14 car models from the Skoda Kodiaq to the Audi A3 and the Volkswagen Tiguan.</p><p>In contrast, Kia&#39;s case concerns only the Carnival model, a seven-seater priced around $73,500, which is among its most expensive cars in India.</p><p>KIA COULD FACE $310 MLN PAYOUT</p><p>Indian tax rules could require Kia to pay up to $310 million if it loses the dispute, or roughly double the amount evaded, due to penalty and interest.</p><p>The latest available corporate filings in India show Kia&#39;s domestic annual sales of $4.45 billion in fiscal 2022/23 were its highest ever, up 53% on the year, for net profit of $243 million.</p><p>Last week, India slashed import duties on fully-built high-end motorcycles to 30%, in a move widely seen as looking to placate U.S. President Donald Trump, who has in the past called India a &quot;tariff king&quot;.</p><p>But fully-assembled imported cars still attract a levy of more than 100%.</p><p>Kia has deposited 2.78 billion rupees ($32 million) &quot;under protest&quot; as it continues to fight the Indian tax notice, which is still proceeding, said a government source who declined to be named as the matter is private.</p><p>In 2022, authorities searched Kia offices and a factory in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh and took statements from India executives, some of whom the document identifies as Chief Procurement Officer Lee Sang Hwa, and Chief Finance Officer Kiho Yoo.</p><p>During the investigation, Kia executives &quot;changed their stance and have made efforts to mislead,&quot; the tax notice stated, referring to statements on imports, manufacturing and taxation.</p><p>Kia was accused of importing more than 90% of the parts for Carnival, constituting a car in CKD form, which attracts higher tax, it added.</p><p>India&#39;s head of indirect taxes, Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, told Reuters the law was clear and some automakers were flouting it by not paying applicable CKD duties.</p><p>&quot;If they are on the wrong side, then the department will have to issue a notice,&quot; he said in an interview on Tuesday.</p><p>(Reporting by Nikunj Ohri, Aditya Kalra and Aditi Shah; Additional reporting by Munsif Vengattil; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)</p></div></article></div>",

We&#39;ll own it,&quot; Trump said.</p><p>He said there was support from the &quot;highest leadership&quot; in the Middle East and upped pressure on Egypt and Jordan to take the Gazans -- despite both governments flatly rejecting the idea.</p><p>Suggesting &quot;long-term ownership&quot; by the United States, Trump said his idea would make it &quot;the Riviera of the Middle East. This could be something that could be so magnificent.&quot;</p><p>Hamas, which seized sole control of Gaza in 2007, rejected the proposal, branding it a&quot; racist&quot; idea.</p><p>&quot;The American racist stance aligns with the Israeli extreme right&#39;s position in displacing our people and eliminating our cause,&quot; Hamas spokesman Abdel Latif al-Qanou said in a statement.</p><p>Much of Gaza was levelled in a 15-month war triggered by Hamas&#39;s October 2023 attack on Israel, and Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for sealing a ceasefire agreement that took effect last month.</p><p>Netanyahu, who has vowed to bring home hostages taken by Hamas and to crush its capabilities, said Trump&#39;s plan could &quot;change history&quot; and was worth &quot;paying attention to&quot;.</p><p>Netanyahu was making the first visit by a foreign leader to the White House since Trump&#39;s return to power, for what were billed as talks on securing a second phase of the truce.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>- &#39;Miserable existence&#39; -</p><p>But it quickly turned into the shock revelation of a proposal that would, if implemented, completely transform the face of the Middle East.</p><p>Trump, who also floated travelling to Gaza, appeared to suggest it would not be rebuilt for Palestinians.</p><p>&quot;It should not go through a process of rebuilding and occupation by the same people that have... lived there and died there and lived a miserable existence there,&quot; he said.</p><p>Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas also rejected the proposal.</p><p>&quot;President Mahmud Abbas and the Palestinian leadership expressed their strong rejection of calls to seize the Gaza Strip and displace Palestinians outside their homeland,&quot; Abbas&#39;s office said in a statement, adding that &quot;legitimate Palestinian rights are not negotiable&quot;.</p><p>Palestinians in Gaza have also denounced Trump&#39;s resettlement idea.</p><p>&quot;Trump thinks Gaza is a pile of garbage -- absolutely not,&quot; said 34-year-old Hatem Azzam, a resident of the southern city of Rafah.</p><p>For Palestinians, any attempts to force them out of Gaza would evoke dark memories of what the Arab world calls the &quot;Nakba&quot;, or catastrophe -- the mass displacement of Palestinians during Israel&#39;s creation in 1948.</p><p>Trump was vague on the details of how he would execute a takeover, but hinted that it could require US boots on the ground in one of the most volatile places on earth &quot;if necessary.&quot;</p><p>Standing at a podium beside Trump, Netanyahu hailed Trump as Israel&#39;s &quot;greatest friend&quot; and praised his &quot;willingness to think outside the box&quot;.</p><p>The two have had tense relations in the past, but Netanyahu has seized on the Republican&#39;s return to power after his ties with former president Joe Biden became strained over the death toll in Gaza.</p><p>- &#39;Winning the war&#39; -</p><p>The Israeli premier would not rule out a return to hostilities with Hamas, or with its other foes in the region including Lebanon&#39;s Hezbollah and Iran.</p><p>&quot;We will end the war by winning the war,&quot; Netanyahu said, while vowing to secure the return of all hostages held by Hamas.</p><p>He did voice confidence that a deal with regional rival Saudi Arabia to normalise relations was &quot;going to happen&quot;.</p><p>But after Trump aired his proposal, Saudi Arabia said it would not formalise ties with Israel unless a Palestinian state is established.</p><p>Trump&#39;s Gaza proposal is set to face harsh opposition.</p><p>Egypt, Jordan and ceasefire mediator Qatar have all rejected Trump&#39;s suggestion of moving Palestinians from Gaza.</p><p>Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said relocating Palestinians was something &quot;neither we nor the region can accept&quot;.</p><p>China too hit out at the proposal, with its foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian saying: &quot;China has always maintained that Palestinian rule over Palestinians is the basic principle of the post-war governance of Gaza, and we are opposed to the forced transfer of the residents of Gaza.&quot;</p><p>The Gaza war began when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, resulting in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p><p>Israel&#39;s retaliatory response has killed at least 47,518 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory&#39;s health ministry.

in a shooting at an adult education centre in the central city of Orebro.</p><p>Several media reported the suspected gunman turned his gun on himself -- but police have not confirmed those reports.</p><p>&quot;Eleven people are dead, including the killer,&quot; police told AFP about Tuesday&#39;s massacre at Campus Risbergska, a secondary school for young adults.</p><p>Local health authorities said Wednesday six people were being treated at Orebro&#39;s university hospital.</p><p>Five of them -- three women and two men -- had undergone surgery for gunshot wounds and were in a &quot;stable but serious&quot; condition.</p><p>A woman was also being treated for minor injuries, Orebro County authorities said in a statement, adding that all the injured were over the age of 18.</p><p>&quot;This is the worst mass shooting in Swedish history,&quot; Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson told a press conference late on Tuesday.</p><p>Kristersson noted a lot of &quot;questions were still unanswered&quot;.</p><p>&quot;But there will come a time when we will know what happened, how it could happen and what motives may have been behind it,&quot; Kristersson said, urging people not to &quot;speculate&quot;.</p><p>&quot;The motive for the shooting is not yet known, but all the indications are that the perpetrator acted alone, without ideological motive,&quot; Orebro police said in a statement.</p><p>Police have not disclosed any information about the identity or ages of the dead, nor whether they were students or teachers at the school.</p><p>School attacks are relatively rare in Sweden, but the country has suffered shootings and bombings linked to gang violence that kill dozens of people each year.</p><p>&quot;The perpetrator is not known to the police, he has no gang affiliations. We believe there will be no further attacks,&quot; Orebro police chief Roberto Eid Forest told reporters on Tuesday evening.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>- &#39;Numb, speechless&#39; -</p><p>Swedish television channel TV4 reported that police had raided the suspect&#39;s home in Orebro late on Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>It said the suspect was around 35 years old and had a license to carry a weapon and no criminal record, but did not provide any details about his identity.</p><p>The man lived reclusively, was unemployed, and had distanced himself from his family and friends, newspaper Aftonbladet reported, citing family members.</p><p>The shooting struck around midday on Tuesday.</p><p>&quot;I was standing there, watching what was happening, and I was just around here when I saw some bodies lying on the ground.

I didn&#39;t really know where to go,&quot; she told AFP on Wednesday morning.</p><p>Her son also has gym classes at Campus Risbergska.</p><p>&quot;So my thoughts were spiralling because I packed his sports bag in the morning,&quot; Demir said.</p><p>- &#39;Dark hour&#39; -</p><p>Sweden&#39;s King Carl XVI Gustaf said in a statement Tuesday that he had received the news of the shooting with &quot;sadness and dismay.&quot;</p><p>The Royal Court announced Wednesday that flags would be &quot;flown at half-mast at all royal palaces&quot; during the day. The government announced a similar measure for its own offices and parliament.</p><p>European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen described the shooting as &quot;truly horrifying&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Such violence and terror have no place in our societies -- least of all in schools. In this dark hour, we stand with the people of Sweden,&quot; she said in a post on X.</p><p>Though such shootings are rare, several other violent incidents have struck Swedish schools in recent years.</p><p>In March 2022, an 18-year-old student stabbed two teachers to death at a secondary school in the southern city of Malmo.</p><p>Two months earlier, a 16-year-old was arrested after wounding another student and a teacher with a knife at a school in the small town of Kristianstad.</p><p>In October 2015, three people were killed in a racially motivated attack at a school in the western town of Trollhattan by a sword-wielding assailant who was later killed by police.</p><p>bur-ef/jll/nl/rlp</p></div></article></div>",

fallen out spectacularly with the country&#39;s leader, paving the way for a Senate trial that could see her removed from office.</p><p>While specifics of the impeachment were not divulged, the vote follows the filing of a trio of complaints in December accusing Duterte of crimes ranging from the &quot;brazen misuse&quot; of millions of dollars in public funds to plotting President Ferdinand Marcos&#39;s assassination.</p><p>&quot;Having been filed by more than one-third of the membership of the House of Representatives, or a total of 215 members ... the motion is approved,&quot; House Speaker Martin Romualdez told lawmakers.</p><p>The fate of Duterte, daughter of the former president, now lies in the hands of the Philippines&#39; 24 senators, two-thirds of whom must vote for her impeachment to remove her from office and disqualify her from future public positions. A trial date has yet to be set.</p><p>Wednesday&#39;s filing comes days before campaigning officially begins for mid-term elections, widely expected to set the table for the 2028 presidential race.</p><p>Whether 16 senators cast their vote for Duterte&#39;s impeachment could come down to President Marcos, Dennis Coronacion, chairman of the political science department at the University of Santo Tomas, told AFP.</p><p>&quot;If (Marcos) is committed to this one, to the impeachment process ... I think getting the required number of Senate votes is possible,&quot; he said, adding Wednesday&#39;s vote had come as something of a surprise.</p><p>But should the administration stay hands-off, the chances of Duterte being impeached are closer to 50-50, Coronacion said, pointing to the sitting senators&#39; need for votes from Duterte stronghold Mindanao in the coming election.</p><p>- Family feud -</p><p>The relationship between Duterte and President Marcos is at a nadir, their former alliance giving way to a months-long public battle that has seen the trading of wild accusations, including an alleged death threat that remains under investigation.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>But Marcos had previously urged Congress not to pursue Duterte&#39;s impeachment, calling it a &quot;storm in a teacup&quot; that would distract the legislature from its primary responsibilities.</p><p>Marcos&#39;s executive secretary Lucas Bersamin, however, said Monday that the Office of the President would &quot;not interfere&quot; with the impeachment complaints.</p><p>A public relations official told AFP the Senate was expecting the articles of impeachment to arrive at its security office around 7:00 pm.</p><p>House of Representatives member Percival Cendana, who had backed one of the three impeachment complaints, urged his colleagues to take quick action at a rally on Friday that drew thousands calling for Duterte&#39;s impeachment.</p><p>Every day of inaction &quot;condones the impunity, the abuse of power and the harassment that Duterte is doing to our country&#39;s leaders&quot;, he told reporters.</p><p>But that rally was dwarfed by one a conservative sect organised that drew hundreds of thousands to the street on January 13 opposing the vice president&#39;s impeachment.</p><p>Duterte was widely tipped to succeed her father Rodrigo as president in 2022 elections but stepped aside to back Marcos and later ran for vice president on his ticket.</p><p>But the alliance has since imploded. In November, she delivered an expletive-laden speech saying she had ordered someone to kill Marcos if she herself was assassinated.</p><p>She later denied that her comments constituted a death threat, saying she had only been expressing &quot;consternation&quot; with the administration&#39;s failures.</p><p>The alleged assassination threat was among the allegations included in the last of the three complaints filed against Duterte, lodged December 19 by&nbsp;seven Manila-based Catholic priests.</p><p>With her impeachment, Duterte becomes one of only four high-ranking officials to share that fate since the Philippines returned to democracy after the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos Sr came to an end in 1986.</p><p>Along with a Supreme Court justice and a high-profile prosecutor, then-president Joseph Estrada was impeached in November 2000 on charges of embezzlement and taking kickbacks from illegal gambling operations.</p><p>When the Senate tribunal refused to accept key evidence, Filipinos took to the streets in a bloodless revolt, leading Estrada to step down when the military withdrew its support.</p><p>cgm/pam/cwl/mtp</p></div></article></div>",

them.</p><p>Although illegal Indian immigrants have been deported home by previous U.S. administrations, it is the first time Washington has used a military aircraft for the purpose. It is also the farthest destination so far for such flights using a military aircraft.</p><p>Reuters reported on Tuesday that the C-17 aircraft with migrants on board had departed for India but would not arrive for at least 24 hours.
