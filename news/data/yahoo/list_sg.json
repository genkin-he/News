Schiefelbein)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio alleged Tuesday that some aid groups may have intentionally sabotaged projects to make a point after he froze most US assistance.</p><p>Rubio, currently on a Latin America tour, doubled down on President Donald Trump&#39;s 90-day suspension of assistance as reports emerge around the world of local aid groups curtailing or stopping life-saving aid.</p><p>&quot;I issued a blanket waiver that said, if this is life-saving programs, OK; if it&#39;s providing food or medicine or anything that is saving lives and is immediate and urgent, you&#39;re not included in the freeze,&quot; Rubio told reporters in Costa Rica.</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know how much more clear we can be than that,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;I would say if some organization is receiving funds from the United States and does not know how to apply a waiver, then I have real questions about the competence of that organization, or I wonder whether they&#39;re deliberately sabotaging it for purposes of making a political point,&quot; said the former Republican senator.</p><p>A day earlier, Rubio said he had been made acting head of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) as Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk look at drastically scaling back aid and merging the organization under the State Department.</p><p>Non-governmental groups say they have heard multiple cases of aid groups that have struggled to operate, mostly smaller organizations that provide targeted services such as health care or education and did not have reserves.</p><p>Some schools have shuttered in Uganda, where USAID was backing a universal education program, and demining work has been disrupted in Cambodia, among other cases.</p><p>- Targeted support to allies -</p><p>Rubio announced that he was issuing new waivers to ensure the flow of assistance to Costa Rica, a major US partner on issues including migration and drug-trafficking.</p><p>US assistance includes biometric work to stop smugglers, which Rubio pointed out as an example of concrete American help that benefits its own interests.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;Under President Trump, we have a foreign policy in which we are strong in providing support to our allies,&quot; Rubio said as he met Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves.</p><p>The top US diplomat, on his third stop in his first trip, is a longtime China hawk who is also looking to push back on Beijing&#39;s influence in the region.</p><p>Costa Rica in 2007 switched recognition to China from Taiwan, the self-governing democracy claimed by Beijing -- a turning point as other Latin American countries followed suit.</p><p>But US officials also see hope in the example of Costa Rica, whose relations with China have turned rockier in recent years.</p><p>Chaves in 2023 effectively forbade Chinese tech titan Huawei from bidding for the nation&#39;s 5G network due to Beijing&#39;s refusal to sign an international agreement on cybercrime.</p><p>&quot;When you confront companies that are not secure, they&#39;re backed by governments like the government of China that likes to threaten, that likes to sabotage, that likes to use economic coercion to punish you,&quot; Rubio said.</p><p>Costa Rica has been &quot;very firm, and I think they deserve a lot of support in confronting that,&quot; Rubio said.</p><p>sct/des</p></div></article></div>",

Trump&#39;s administration cracks down on illegal migration, the White House said.</p><p>Guantanamo is primarily known as a detention center for suspects accused of terrorism-related offenses, but the base also has a history of being used to hold migrants, and Trump last week ordered the preparation of a 30,000-person &quot;migrant facility&quot; there.</p><p>&quot;Today, the first flights from the United States to Guantanamo Bay with illegal migrants are underway,&quot; Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Fox Business.</p><p>Trump has launched what his second administration is casting as a major effort to combat illegal migration, trumpeting immigration raids, arrests and deportations on military aircraft.</p><p>The president has made the issue a priority on the international stage as well, threatening Colombia with sanctions and massive tariffs for turning back two planeloads of deportees.</p><p>The Guantanamo prison was opened in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and has been used to indefinitely hold detainees seized during the wars and other operations that followed.</p><p>The conditions there have prompted consistent outcry from rights groups, and UN experts have condemned it as a site of &quot;unparalleled notoriety.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;Perfect place&#39; -</p><p>Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden both sought to close the facility, but Congress has opposed efforts to shutter Guantanamo and it remains open to this day.</p><p>It still holds 15 people incarcerated for militant activity or terrorism-related offenses, among them several accused plotters of the 9/11 attacks, including self-proclaimed mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.</p><p>But migrants will be detained in a separate part of the base.</p><p>According to US Southern Command, there are some 300 American military personnel at Guantanamo supporting &quot;illegal alien holding operations.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The base has for decades been used to hold Caribbean asylum seekers and refugees caught at sea, and was used in the 1990s to house tens of thousands of Haitians and Cubans who fled crises in their homelands.</p><p>They were accommodated in tent cities, with many eventually sent home after being held at Guantanamo for years.</p><p>Thousands of undocumented migrants have been arrested since Trump&#39;s January 20 inauguration, including some accused of crimes.</p><p>An unknown number have been repatriated to Colombia, Mexico, Guatemala, Brazil and other countries, and Trump has vowed to expel millions.</p><p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday described Guantanamo as the &quot;perfect place&quot; to detain migrants as he visited the border with Mexico -- an area where the Trump administration has boosted the country&#39;s military presence in recent weeks.</p><p>The Pentagon will provide any necessary assets &quot;to support the expulsion and detention of those in our country illegally,&quot; Hegseth said.</p><p>wd/bjt</p></div></article></div>",

Donald Trump unleashes trade wars and tariffs, the system for settling such disputes within the World Trade Organization has been paralysed for years -- by the United States.</p><p>Having returned to the White House, Trump has imposed a 10 percent tariff hike on Chinese goods, with Beijing immediately retaliating with tariffs on US imports of energy, cars and machinery parts.</p><p>China said Tuesday that it would file a complaint with the WTO over the &quot;malicious&quot; US levies -- but that move is likely to hit a dead end, unless Beijing and Washington resolve the spat of their own accord.</p><p>- Obama, Trump, Biden roadblock -</p><p>The WTO was founded in 1995 as a successor to GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade dating back to 1948.</p><p>The process for resolving a dispute at the Geneva-based global trade body goes through several stages.</p><p>When a complaint is brought, consultations are initiated between the members at odds with each other.</p><p>If no agreement is reached, the complainant can request the establishment of a special panel, made up of three to five experts. Countries can appeal against the panel&#39;s ruling.</p><p>But the WTO&#39;s Appellate Body, composed of seven specialists in international law and trade, has not been able to handle any new cases since December 2019: its seats remain empty due to the United States blocking nominations.</p><p>This practice began under US president Barack Obama, continued throughout Trump&#39;s first term, and carried on under his successor Joe Biden.</p><p>Washington accuses the Appellate Body of over-interpreting international trade rules and not respecting WTO deadlines for completing cases.</p><p>The United States also insists the body&#39;s decisions must not encroach on &quot;national security&quot;.</p><p>In 2022, the WTO&#39;s members decided to hold discussions aimed at having a fully operational system up and running by 2024 -- but no agreement has yet been reached.</p><p>In the meantime, a number of WTO members, including the European Union and China, have developed an alternative appellate process allowing some cases move forward.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Among those cases is a spat between Brussels and Colombia over Bogota&#39;s anti-dumping duties on imports of frozen fries from three EU nations.</p><p>But the United States has not signed up.</p><p>So while this temporary system works well for the participating countries, it does not prevent other WTO members from continuing to file appeals to the moribund Appellate Body -- effectively leaving the cases in limbo.</p><p>- Into the void -</p><p>Currently, 32 dispute panel rulings &quot;have been appealed into the void&quot;, according to the WTO.</p><p>As a result, the decisions of the agency&#39;s Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) do not apply because the appeal is up in the air.</p><p>Of these 32 appeals, two were filed by the United States -- against China and Turkey -- and 11 were filed against the United States, including three by China, two by Canada and two by Turkey.</p><p>And although the Appellate Body is not functioning, a number of countries are continuing to launch initial complaints, as China has now done.</p><p>The last time Washington brought a dispute in the first instance was in July 2019, in an agricultural spat with India. The two countries have since reached an agreement.</p><p>When a country is rebuked by the dispute settlement body, it must implement the experts&#39; recommendations within a so-called reasonable timeframe set by the DSB. Sanctions can be imposed if the country does not fulfil its obligations.</p><p>apo/rjm/nl/js</p></div></article></div>",

economies in an escalating trade war.</p><p>Beijing said it was imposing levies on imports of US energy, vehicles and equipment in a return salvo minutes after Trump&#39;s threatened tariffs on Chinese goods came into effect.</p><p>Trump suspended tariffs on Mexico and Canada on Monday for a month after they vowed to step up measures to counter flows of the drug fentanyl and crossing of

websites will not be allowed to use it to trick users into spending money under EU AI guidelines announced on Tuesday.</p><p>The guidelines from the European Commission come as companies grapple with the complexity and cost of complying with the world&#39;s first legislation on the use of the technology.</p><p>The Artificial Intelligence Act, binding since last year, will be fully applicable on Aug. 2, 2026, with certain provisions kicking in earlier, such as the ban on certain practices from Feb. 2 this year.</p><p>&quot;The ambition is to provide legal certainty for those who provide or deploy the artificial intelligence systems on the European market, also for the market surveillance authorities. The guidelines are not legally binding,&quot; a Commission official told reporters.</p><p>Prohibited practices include AI-enabled dark patterns embedded in services designed to manipulate users into making substantial financial commitments, and AI-enabled applications which exploit users based on their age, disability or socio-economic situation.</p><p>AI-enabled social scoring using unrelated personal data such as origin and race by social welfare agencies and other public and private bodies is banned, while police are not allowed to predict individuals&#39; criminal behaviour solely based on their biometric data if this has not been verified.</p><p>Employers cannot use webcams and voice recognition systems to track employees&#39; emotions, while mobile CCTV cameras equipped with AI-based facial recognition technologies for law enforcement purposes are prohibited, with limited exceptions and stringent safeguards.</p><p>EU countries have until Aug. 2 to designate market surveillance authorities to enforce the AI rules. AI breaches can cost companies fines ranging from 1.5% to 7% of their total global revenue.</p><p>The EU AI Act is more comprehensive than the United States&#39; light-touch voluntary compliance approach while China&#39;s approach aims to maintain social stability and state control.</p><p>(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Alison Williams)</p></div></article></div>",
