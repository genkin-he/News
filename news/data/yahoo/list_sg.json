his return to the White House (Jim WATSON)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was set to meet Donald Trump on Tuesday, the first foreign leader hosted by the new US president, with the pair poised to address the fragile Gaza truce.</p><p>After Trump claimed credit for securing the Israel-Hamas truce after more than 15 months of fighting and bombing, he was likely to urge his ally to stick to the deal -- parts of which have yet to be finalised.</p><p>In a possible sign of progress, Israel said hours ahead of the White House meeting that it was sending a team to mediator Qatar to discuss the second phase of the agreement, which could lead to a more permanent end to the war.</p><p>Palestinian group Hamas said on Tuesday that negotiations for the second phase had begun, with spokesman Abdel Latif al-Qanou saying the focus was on &quot;shelter, relief and reconstruction&quot; for the war-ravaged Gaza Strip.</p><p>Trump has touted a plan to &quot;clean out&quot; Gaza, calling for Palestinians to move to Egypt or Jordan.</p><p>Both countries have flatly rejected his proposal, as have the territory&#39;s own residents.</p><p>&quot;Trump thinks Gaza is a pile of garbage -- absolutely not,&quot; said Hatem Azzam, a 34-year-old resident of the Gaza Strip.</p><p>&quot;Trump and Netanyahu must understand the reality of the Palestinian people and the people of Gaza. This is a people deeply rooted in their land. We will not leave,&quot; he added.</p><p>In line with the ceasefire, Palestinian militant groups and Israel have begun exchanging hostages held in Gaza for prisoners in Israeli custody.</p><p>- &#39;Redrawn the map&#39; -</p><p>The war began when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, taking into Gaza 251 hostages, dozens of whom have since been confirmed dead.</p><p>Seventy-six are still held in the Palestinian territory including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.</p><p>Families of the Israeli hostages have been urging all sides to ensure the agreement is maintained so their loved ones can be freed.</p><p>Relatives of the youngest hostages, Ariel and Kfir Bibas, made a plea on Monday for information on the two boys and their mother, Shiri, after their father Yarden Bibas was released in the latest swap.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;Shiri, Ariel and Kfir, we miss you so much and are waiting for you,&quot; said Ofri Bibas, Yarden&#39;s sister.</p><p>Before leaving for Washington, Netanyahu said Israel&#39;s wars with Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and its confrontations with Iran since October 2023 had &quot;redrawn the map&quot; of the Middle East.</p><p>&quot;I believe that working closely with President Trump we can redraw it even further, and for the better,&quot; he said.</p><p>Trump, who prides himself on his dealmaking abilities, may seek to offer Netanyahu incentives to sticking to the truce, such as a normalisation deal with Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Efforts under Trump&#39;s predecessor Joe Biden for normalisation froze with the Gaza war, and Saudi Arabia has in recent months hardened its position insisting there would be no agreement without a Palestinian state.</p><p>Trump said Sunday that talks with Israel and other Middle Eastern countries were &quot;progressing&quot; -- before warning that he had &quot;no assurances&quot; and &quot;no guarantees&quot; that the truce in Gaza would hold.</p><p>The US president&#39;s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who met Netanyahu on Monday over terms for the second phase of the truce, said that he was &quot;certainly hopeful&quot;.</p><p>- West Bank violence -</p><p>Since the truce took effect on January 19, Israel has turned its focus to the occupied West Bank, launching a deadly operation in the area around Jenin, a hotbed of Palestinian militancy.</p><p>UN aid agency UNRWA, which is now banned in Israel, warned the refugee camp of Jenin was &quot;going into a catastrophic direction&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Large parts of the camp were completely destroyed in a series of detonations by the Israeli forces. It is estimated that 100 houses were destroyed or heavily damaged,&quot; said UNRWA spokeswoman Juliette Touma.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Israeli army said a gunman killed two Israeli soldiers in an attack on a military post in Tayasir, south of the Jenin area in the northern West Bank. The assailant was also killed.</p><p>Asked about how he viewed a possible annexation of the West Bank, Trump did not rule it out, telling reporters that Israel was &quot;a small country in terms of land&quot;.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s a pretty small piece of land. And it&#39;s amazing that they&#39;ve been able to do what they&#39;ve been able to do,&quot; he said.</p><p>Under the Gaza ceasefire&#39;s ongoing 42-day first phase, Hamas was to free 33 hostages in staggered releases in exchange for around 1,900 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.</p><p>Four hostage-prisoner exchanges have already taken place, with militants freeing 18 hostages in exchange of some 600 mostly Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.</p><p>The truce has also led to a surge of food, fuel, medical and other aid into Gaza, and allowed people displaced by the war to return to the north of the Palestinian territory.</p><p>Hamas&#39;s attack resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people on Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p><p>Israel&#39;s retaliatory response has killed at least 47,518 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory&#39;s health ministry. The UN considers these figures as reliable.</p><p>burs-ser/ami</p></div></article></div>",

among countries in Africa&#39;s Lake Chad region are hindering efforts to end a more than decade-long jihadist insurgency, according to local officials and security sources.</p><p>The region, comprising the four countries that surround Lake Chad -- Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria -- has been battling insurgency since 2009, after a spate of violent campaigns by the Boko Haram jihadist group in Nigeria&#39;s northeast spilled into its neighbours.</p><p>The ensuing conflict, which has drawn in other jihadist groups such as the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), has killed over 40,000 people and displaced around two million, causing one of the world&#39;s worst humanitarian crises.</p><p>Last week, Nigeria&#39;s Yobe State, one of the most impacted by jihadist violence, held a summit to discuss how to stabilise and recover areas affected by the conflict, in collaboration with organisations including the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).</p><p>The lake region has become a jihadist stronghold, disrupting fishing, farming and herding, on which the 40 million people who live there depend.</p><p>Jihadist violence has added to the cocktail of challenges the region has faced for the last 40 years.</p><p>The lake&#39;s surface water has shrunk by 90 percent due largely to climate change and mismanagement, making the region&#39;s population among the world&#39;s poorest.</p><p>Since 2013, a regional military coalition involving troops from the four countries, the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF), has been fighting Islamist groups in the area.</p><p>But recent diplomatic faceoffs, especially between Nigeria and Niger, are hampering progress, military chiefs said.</p><p>Relations between the two neighbours soured after the military took power in Niger in 2023.</p><p>The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), currently headed by Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, responded with crippling sanctions, and Niger broke away from the group.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>- Recriminations -</p><p>Chad, Niger and Nigeria hurled allegations of lethargy, sabotage and non-cooperation during the summit, warning that the situation was hindering the anti-jihadist fight.</p><p>In a veiled message to Niger, Nigeria&#39;s Tinubu warned that regional discord would only benefit Boko Haram and ISWAP, which he described as the &quot;true enemy&quot;.</p><p>He told the summit the jihadists do not stand &quot;a chance against the collective strength&quot; of the regional military coalition, warning against &quot;misinformation and falsehoods which breed mistrust&quot;.</p><p>But the governor of Niger&#39;s Diffa region, Brigadier General Mahamadou Ibrahim Bagadoma, said there could only be cooperation and coordination when Nigerian interference and sabotage against his country stopped.</p><p>He reiterated recent claims that French troops recently expelled from his country were using Nigeria as a base to attack Niger. Nigeria has repeatedly denied the accusation.</p><p>&quot;The problem is while some are making efforts, some are sabotaging them,&quot; Bagadoma said at the summit.</p><p>He told reporters that &quot;the existing sour relations (with Nigeria) is a political issue&quot; that would be difficult to solve as long as &quot;some people take the path of selfishness&quot;.</p><p>The governor of Chad&#39;s Lake Province, General Saleh Tidjani Haggar, deplored the lack of military and intelligence sharing between the four countries.</p><p>The region could &quot;finish off Boko Haram in three months&quot; if it worked together, he said.</p><p>A Nigerian intelligence report seen by AFP and shared among Nigerian security circles on Monday showed how ISWAP had chased out communities in the Damasak area along Nigeria&#39;s border with Niger in preparation for a possible attack on military bases in the region, highlighting the lack of coordination between the two countries.</p><p>- &#39;One Family&#39; -</p><p>An AFP journalist saw the MNJTF commander, Nigerian Major General Godwin Mutkut, complaining to Bagadoma on the sidelines of the summit about an alleged order for Niger&#39;s military officers not to talk to their counterparts from Nigeria.</p><p>Speaking at the summit, General Christopher Musa, Nigeria&#39;s defence chief, called on Niger to come back into the fold of the MNJTF.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m very happy... that the governor of Diffa is here. I want to assure him that we are one family. There is no dispute between us that cannot be solved,&quot; Musa said.</p><p>Mamman Nuhu, the head of the Lake Chad Basin Development Commission (LCBDC), acknowledged the negative impact the lack of military coordination between Nigeria and Niger is having on the region despite the &quot;huge progress&quot; made.</p><p>&quot;Defeating Boko Haram is key to restoring peace and prosperity to the region,&quot; Nuhu told AFP.</p><p>abu/tba/jhb</p></div></article></div>",

high-profile detainees in recent weeks.</p><p>They include a Filipina mother on death row and the last five members of the &quot;Bali Nine&quot; drug ring.</p><p>Atlaoui was tight-lipped and wore a

clemency, amnesty or a reduced sentence.</p><p>His return was made possible after an agreement between French Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin and his Indonesian counterpart, Yusril Ihza Mahendra, on January 24.</p><p>In the agreement, Jakarta said they had decided not to execute Atlaoui and authorised his return on &quot;humanitarian grounds&quot; because he was ill.</p><p>Atlaoui had been

21 percent on the previous year to 1.53 billion euros ($1.58 billion), beating the 1.46 billion euros predicted by analysts surveyed by Factset.</p><p>For the fourth quarter alone, net profit climbed 31 percent from the period the year before to 386 million euros, also ahead of forecasts.</p><p>Revenues reached 6.68 billion euros over the full year, surpassing Ferrari&#39;s own target of more than 6.55 billion euros.</p><p>Yet the company sold just 89 more cars compared to the previous year, with shipments increasing barely one percent to 13,752.</p><p>&quot;Quality of revenues over volumes --

preceding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s arrival in Washington on Monday to meet with President Donald Trump, Israeli officials and right-wing allies of Netanyahu in the United States have attacked Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, and Qatar’s role as a critical broker of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement.</span></p><p><span>The effort to undermine Witkoff and Qatar raises fears among ceasefire supporters that while Netanyahu outwardly supports the Trump-backed ceasefire deal, he is quietly trying to delay — or even scuttle — the second phase of the ceasefire, which would fully end the war in Gaza.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“They’re undermining President Donald Trump,” said an American close to both the Trump administration and Gulf Arab countries, who requested anonymity to speak without authorization. “It’s President Donald Trump’s deal, and President Donald Trump’s best friend who’s his official representative on the deal.”</span></p><p><span>Witkoff, a wealthy real-estate tycoon, played an integral role in sealing the </span><a

An end to the war is likely to also bring a moment of political reckoning for Netanyahu over his failure to prevent the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack, and increase the likelihood he faces legal consequences for alleged corruption, according to the former official, who requested anonymity to speak freely.</p><p>“Bibi Netanyahu gets to continue his war, which means he gets to continue his government, and at the end of the day that seems to be driving decision-making on Balfour Street more than what’s best for the people of Israel and for the country of Israel,” said the former senior U.S. official, referencing the Jerusalem street where the Israeli prime minister’s office is located. “And if he can do that by tearing down both Witkoff and Qatar in the same breath, all the better, because it fits a narrative that also relieves him of responsibility for October 7.”</p><p>The former U.S. official also said he has spoken to career officials in the Israeli government who share his concerns that Netanyahu is trying to obstruct full implementation of the ceasefire agreement.</p><p>Netanyahu’s <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-02-01/ty-article/.premium/sources-netanyahu-to-add-dermer-to-gaza-talks-replace-mossad-chief-as-u-s-liaison/00000194-c2fc-d78d-affc-e3ff82030000\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:decision;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">decision</a> to have aide Ron Dermer, a hawkish loyalist, take over as head of the hostage negotiation team with a focus on handling interactions with the United States has only heightened those concerns for ceasefire supporters.

These right-wing Israelis have pilloried Qatar, a major non-NATO U.S. ally, for hosting Hamas’ political leadership and for previously providing cash aid in Gaza that included salary payments for Hamas’ government employees.

For example, he campaigned heavily on brokering a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, despite neoconservatives’ insistence on funding and arming Ukraine even more aggressively than the United States already is.</p><p>Trump’s record on Israel-Palestine policy, by contrast, has generally been more to neoconservatives’ liking. In his first term, Trump tore up the Iran nuclear agreement, moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, and approved of Israel’s settlement expansion spree. And as a candidate in 2024, Trump promised to be more pro-Israel than Biden, whom he dubbed a “Palestinian.”</p><p>But Trump’s insistence on a ceasefire deal, selection of Witkoff and decision to end <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/politics/trump-pompeo-security-iran.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:federally provided security protection;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">federally provided security protection</a> for Iran hawks from his first administration have spooked some right-wing Israelis and their allies in the United States.

Dimino, a former CIA analyst, and Dan Caldwell, an Iraq War veteran who has advised the administration on major defense hires, both have worked at the anti-interventionist think tank, Defense Priorities — a part of the libertarian-minded Koch network. Republican interventionists have taken to Jewish Insider to bash all three figures.</p><p>“The Koch crowd is either isolationist, anti-American or both and seeks to use American fatigue to cynically weaken our allies and diminish American power,” David Wurmser, an Iraq War architect who advised former Vice President Dick Cheney, <a href=\"https://jewishinsider.com/2025/01/dan-caldwell-pentagon-isolationist-koch-network-middle-e/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:told Jewish Insider;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">told Jewish Insider</a>.</p><p>In a recent episode of his web show, Tucker Carlson, a Trump supporter with open disdain for neoconservatives, characterized the attacks on Dimino, Caldwell and Witkoff as part of the same broader effort by neoconservatives to smear their opponents.</p><p>Caldwell, who Carlson knows personally, is “being attacked by people who never served … as somehow anti-American,” <a href=\"https://x.com/tcnetwork/status/1884059318753821115?s=46\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Carlson said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Carlson said</a> while interviewing Curt Mills, executive director of The American Conservative, a conservative anti-interventionist magazine.</p><p>“Rather than say, ‘Hey, Steve Witkoff, I disagree with you, or whatever,’ it’s, ‘He’s working for Qatar,’” <a href=\"https://x.com/tcnetwork/status/1884059318753821115?s=46\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Carlson added;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Carlson added</a>. “These people are disgusting.
