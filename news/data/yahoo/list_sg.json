He instead suggested that any amount of the drug entering from a foreign country was too much and might warrant retaliation.</p><p>“So you are saying there is an acceptable level of fentanyl?” he said. “Are you saying 40 pounds of fentanyl is acceptable? Because according to the DEA, two milligrams, equivalent to a few grains of salt, can kill someone.”</p><p>For months, Trump has been claiming that fentanyl from Canada required the imposition of punitive tariffs — only to later <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113934520197790682\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:say;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">say</a> that Canada deserved tariffs because it ran a trade surplus against the United States while simultaneously suggesting that the entire problem could be resolved if it agreed to become the 51st U.S. state.</p><p>This week, Trump <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-tariffs-mexico_n_67a0e4a3e4b021be14ed99ed\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:backed down;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">backed down</a> from his 25% tariff threat against both Canada and Mexico for at least one month without gaining anything. Mexico again promised to deploy troops to help prevent illegal border crossings, as it has repeatedly in recent years. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised the same $1.3 billion in border security enhancements he had already pledged in December, only this time with the addition of a new “fentanyl czar” in the Canadian government.</p><p>In the meantime, Trump has done nothing since taking office to push for the fentanyl-detecting equipment that had been contained in bipartisan border security legislation that he <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/border-bill-senate-election_n_664f4817e4b042129b89cf01\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:blocked;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">blocked</a> last summer.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“He stood in the way of 100 fentanyl detection machines,” said Andrew Bates, a former White House aide under President Joe Biden, referring to the devices that the Department of Homeland Security says are the best tool for stopping the flow of the drug.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 419px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"The U.S.-Canada border crossing in St-Bernard-de-Lacolle, Quebec, on Feb. 4, 2025.

More than a decade ago, it was used in the earliest days of the fentanyl epidemic to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast/397113/ross-ulbricht-silk-road-drugs-nick-bilton-pardon\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:mail;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">mail</a> the drug directly into the country.</p><p>Federal prosecutors showed how at least six Americans died from an overdose using Silk Road, with Ulbricht getting a commission from every transaction. He was convicted by a jury and sentenced to two life terms plus 40 years.</p><p>Trump said he pardoned Ulbricht because he promised pro-drug libertarians he would do so if they supported his candidacy. “The scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me,” Trump&nbsp;<a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113869112741612092\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:wrote;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">wrote</a> in a Jan. 21 social media post.</p><p>Trump’s “weaponization” claim refers to two federal prosecutions against him: one for his Jan. 6, 2021, <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-coup-media_n_64505256e4b039ec4e867f2d\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:coup;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">coup</a> attempt, and the other for his refusal to turn over secret documents he took with him to his South Florida country club upon leaving the White House in 2021.

2021 (ANDY BUCHANAN)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Holding long-term global warming to two degrees Celsius -- the fallback target of the Paris climate accord -- is now &quot;impossible,&quot; according to a stark new analysis published by leading scientists.</p><p>Led by renowned climatologist James Hansen, the paper appears in the journal &quot;Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development&quot; and concludes that Earth&#39;s climate is more sensitive to rising greenhouse gas emissions than previously thought.</p><p>Compounding the crisis, Hansen and colleagues argued, is a recent decline in sunlight-blocking aerosol pollution from the shipping industry, which had been mitigating some of the warming.</p><p>An ambitious climate change scenario outlined by the UN&#39;s climate panel, which gives the planet a 50 percent chance of keeping warming under 2C by the year 2100, &quot;is an implausible scenario,&quot; Hansen told a briefing Tuesday.</p><p>&quot;That scenario is now impossible,&quot; said Hansen, formerly a top NASA climate scientist who famously announced to the US Congress in 1988 that global warming was underway.</p><p>&quot;The two degree target is dead.&quot;</p><p>Instead, he and co-authors argued, the amount of greenhouse gases already pumped into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels meant increased warming is now guaranteed.</p><p>Temperatures will stay at or above 1.5C in the coming years -- devastating coral reefs and fueling more intense storms -- before rising to around 2.0C by 2045, they forecast.</p><p>They estimated polar ice melt and freshwater injection into the North Atlantic will trigger the shutdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) within the next 20–30 years.</p><p>The current brings warmth to various parts of the globe and also carries nutrients necessary to sustain ocean life.</p><p>Its end &quot;will lock in major problems including sea level rise of several meters -- thus, we describe AMOC shutdown as the &#39;point of no return,&#39;&quot; the paper argued.</p><p>The world&#39;s nations agreed during the landmark Paris climate accord of 2015 to try to hold end-of-century warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Scientists identified the threshold as critical to preventing the breakdown of major ocean circulation systems, the abrupt thawing of boreal permafrost, and the collapse of tropical coral reefs.</p><p>The 1.5C target has already been breached over the past two years, according to data from the EU&#39;s climate monitoring system Copernicus, though the Paris Agreement referred to a long-term trend over decades.</p><p>At 2C, the impacts would be even greater, including irreversible loss to Earth&#39;s ice sheets, mountain glaciers and snow, sea ice and permafrost.</p><p>The authors acknowledged the findings appeared grim, but argued that honesty is a necessary ingredient for change.</p><p>&quot;Failure to be realistic in climate assessment and failure to call out the fecklessness of current policies to stem global warming is not helpful to young people,&quot; they said.</p><p>&quot;Today, with rising crises including global climate change, we have reached a point where we must address the problem of special interests,&quot; they added, stressing they were &quot;optimistic&quot; for the future.</p><p>ia/des</p></div></article></div>",

vaccines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">questioned the safety of vaccines</a>. </span></p><p>But after pressure from Trump and his army of online allies, nearly every Republican has backed down and embraced all of the president’s picks for powerful Cabinet posts, including Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p><p>Trump is now set to continue efforts to dismantle parts of the federal government with a full complement of top aides, working in tandem with billionaire Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Musk’s team has moved to unilaterally gut federal agencies and freeze spending approved by Congress, over the objections of Democrats and legal experts, who warn it could be unconstitutional.</p><p>“The senate of America seems a lot like the Senate of late Rome. They exist to do the bidding of the emperor,” former Illinois GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a prominent Trump critic, wrote in a <a href=\"https://x.com/AdamKinzinger/status/1886812539637416338\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">post</a> online on Tuesday.</p><h2><strong>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</strong></h2><p>Kennedy has drawn strong opposition from Democrats and outside groups over his long history of peddling anti-vaccine misinformation, including the falsehood that vaccines cause autism. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who is a physician and the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, initially appeared to have grave doubts about Kennedy’s belief in settled science.</p><p>“I’ve been struggling with your nomination,” Cassidy admitted to Kennedy last month, when he testified before the health panel.</p><p>“As someone who has discussed immunizations with thousands of people, I understand that mothers want reassurance that the vaccine their child is receiving is necessary, safe and effective,” said the Louisiana senator. “I’ve approached it using the preponderance of evidence to reassure, and you’ve approached it using selective evidence to cast doubt.”</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Fast forward to Tuesday, and moments before the Senate Finance Committee voted to advance Kennedy to the Senate floor for his confirmation vote, Cassidy — also a member of this committee — <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rfk-senate-committee-hhs_n_67a22b5ae4b0cf0f0a35f28a?ndk\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:voted to back his nomination;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">voted to back his nomination</a>. He explained that he changed his mind because Kennedy promised to “meet or speak multiple times a month” about what he’s working on and receive input on his hiring decisions at the department.</p><p>“Mr. Kennedy and the administration reached out, seeking to reassure me regarding their commitment to protecting the public health benefit of vaccination,” Cassidy said. “To this end, Mr. Kennedy and the administration committed that he and I would have an unprecedentedly close, collaborative working relationship if he is confirmed. ... This collaboration will allow us to work well together and therefore to be more effective.”</p><p>Kennedy said that the partnership “will allow us to represent all sides” of vaccine safety in government.</p><p>Cassidy’s decision to support Kennedy was worrisome even to some conservative observers, as they feared he had dropped his legitimate concerns about the nominee in order to get in line with his party behind Trump. The Louisiana Republican is up for reelection in 2026 and has already drawn a GOP primary challenger, who is likely to remind voters about Cassidy’s vote to convict Trump in his 2021 Senate impeachment trial following the Jan. 6 insurrection.</p><p>“Cassidy’s vote is the single most disappointing, and frightening, occurrence yet in the series of abject surrenders to Trump,” Quin Hillyer, a longtime conservative columnist based in Alabama, <a href=\"https://x.com/quinhillyer/status/1886824479738724394?s=46&amp;t=baBBhbs8HKxS8e5N8kXp1g\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:wrote on social media;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">wrote on social media</a>. “It says there remains NO check in Congress, NONE, against Trump’s outrages, constitutional abuses, and seizures of unwarranted power.”</p><h2><strong>Tulsi Gabbard</strong></h2><p>Gabbard, a lieutenant colonel in the National Guard and former Democratic member of Congress who switched parties last year, had been viewed as the Trump nominee with one of the hardest paths to confirmation. Numerous Senate Republicans expressed concerns with her qualifications to be director of national intelligence, her commitment to top secret intelligence programs, her 2017 meeting with former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and her past statements echoing Moscow’s talking points about Russia’s war on Ukraine.</p><p>Frustration with Gabbard <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tulsi-gabbard-donald-trump-snowden_n_679bd0bae4b0e1faebeee9c7\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:boiled over;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">boiled over </a>during her committee hearing last week, with multiple GOP senators urging her to condemn Edward Snowden, who leaked information on classified intelligence programs in 2013. In Congress, Gabbard had called Snowden “brave” and proposed calling for charges to be dropped against him. She refused to disavow her past support for Snowden and call him a “traitor,” as several Republican senators demanded.</p><p>“It would befit you and be helpful to the way you are perceived to the members of the Intelligence Committee if you at least acknowledge that the greatest whistleblower in American security, so-called, harmed national security,” Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) told Gabbard.</p><p>On Monday, however, Gabbard’s nomination got a major boost after Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a GOP swing vote, announced she would support her confirmation. The Republican senator said Gabbard had addressed her concerns about Snowden and promised not to endorse a potential presidential pardon for him.</p><p>With Collins squarely in the yes column, all eyes turned to Young, a Marine and former intelligence officer with hawkish views who had been critical of Trump in the past. The Indiana Republican announced his support for Gabbard on Tuesday shortly before her nomination advanced in the Senate Intelligence Committee after speaking with Trump and billionaire Elon Musk. The Tesla CEO and Trump ally accused Young of being a “<a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-called-todd-young-223044360.html\" data-ylk=\"slk:deep state puppet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link\">deep state puppet</a>” over the weekend, but Musk <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-called-todd-young-223044360.html\" data-ylk=\"slk:recanted;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link\">recanted</a> shortly after Young got on the phone with him.</p><p>Young said he was satisfied with commitments Gabbard had made to him to hold any leakers of intelligence information accountable and to not recommend any pardon for Snowden.</p><p>“I have done what the Framers envisioned for senators to do: use the consultative process to seek firm commitments, in this case commitments that will advance our national security, which is my top priority as a former Marine Corps intelligence officer,” Young said Tuesday.</p><p>Unlike Cassidy, Young does not face reelection until 2028, theoretically giving him a degree of political insulation in the Senate. Still, the prospect of singlehandedly taking down a Trump nominee would have risked even greater anger from Trump’s allies, even though the president reportedly told Young to “<a href=\"https://x.com/mkraju/status/1886864354064130327\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:vote your conscience;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">vote your conscience</a>.”</p><h2><strong>Pete Hegseth</strong></h2><p>Last month, the Senate confirmed Hegseth as Trump’s defense secretary after weeks of debate about his slim qualifications and his alleged history of excessive drinking and domestic abuse. Three GOP senators — Collins, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky — stood in opposition, but Vice President JD Vance broke the 50-50 tie and his nomination was confirmed.</p><p>New reporting from <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/pete-hegseth-thom-tillis-senate-confirmation-1974dd47?st=eeDK69&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:The Wall Street Journal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">The Wall Street Journal</a> on Monday, however, revealed that another GOP senator — Thom Tillis of North Carolina — had been prepared to vote against Hegseth because of the abuse allegations, and had informed the White House of his intention to do so. Tillis backed down <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/pete-hegseth-thom-tillis-senate-confirmation-1974dd47?st=eeDK69&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:hours before the vote;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">hours before the vote</a>, however, after GOP leaders told him they would not cancel it, making clear he’d have to endure backlash from Trump’s MAGA allies if he voted Hegseth down.</p><p>“Anytime you have an allegation and somebody is willing to put it in sworn testimony, you owe it to the process to review it and not just dispose it out of hand,” Tills told<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senator-tillis-opens-up-about-role-pete-hegseths-confirmation-after-ex-sister-in-law-allegations\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Fox News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"> Fox News</a> about conversations with Hegseth’s accusers. “And that’s exactly what I did. And then I arrived at the conclusion that I’d support Pete’s nomination.”</p><p>Tillis is also up for reelection in 2026 and is likely to face several GOP primary challengers. In 2023, the North Carolina state Republican Party <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/06/11/1181549031/thom-tillis-north-carolina-censure-lgbtq-rights-gun-control-immigration\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:censured;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">censured</a> Tillis for backing LGBTQ+ rights, immigration and gun violence policies in Congress.</p><p>Some Democrats said they were surprised to see their Republican colleagues fold so quickly on Trump’s most problematic Cabinet picks.</p><p>“There are so many reasons that they should be defeated by their own statements, both past and recent,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said of the nominees.</p><p>Of his colleagues, Blumenthal added, “Anyone voting for these nominees will be haunted by those decisions when they do bad things.”</p><p>Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) also expressed disappointment in Republican senators, who he said are “maybe secretly whispering” to Democrats about their concerns with certain Trump nominees but will then turn around and vote for them on the Senate floor.</p><p>“At some point, people are going to have to stand up and say, this is not what we meant,” Schatz said in a speech on the Senate floor.</p><h3>Related...</h3><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/times-tulsi-gabbard-congress-now-deposed-syria-bashar-assad_n_675c8ab8e4b08821cba7819a\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:7 Times Tulsi Gabbard Went To Bat In Congress For Now-Deposed Syrian Dictator Bashar Assad;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">7 Times Tulsi Gabbard Went To Bat In Congress For Now-Deposed Syrian Dictator Bashar Assad</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-vaccines-kennedy-autism-conspiracy_n_67a227ffe4b09c9485622a52\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Trump Appears To Support Vaccine Conspiracy Theory In Pro-RFK Jr. Post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Trump Appears To Support Vaccine Conspiracy Theory In Pro-RFK Jr. Post</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rfk-jr-abortion-medication-fda_n_67a1373ae4b06678d2a183ba\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Why RFK Jr.&#39;s Promise On Medication Abortion Matters More Than You Think;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Why RFK Jr.&#39;s Promise On Medication Abortion Matters More Than You Think</a></p></li></ul></div></article></div>",

Kenya-led force.</p><p>The UN Security Council gave the green light in October 2023 to the Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission designed to support Haiti&#39;s authorities in their fight against criminal gangs, which control swaths of the country.</p><p>Washington&#39;s funding freeze comes as part of newly elected President Donald Trump&#39;s push to slash US overseas aid, a drive that has included an effort to shutter the operations of the government&#39;s main aid agency, USAID.</p><p>In late January, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that Haiti&#39;s capital could become overrun by gangs if the international community does not step up aid to the security mission.</p><p>More money, equipment and personnel are needed for the international force, Guterres said, adding that any further delays risk the &quot;catastrophic&quot; collapse of Haiti&#39;s security institutions and &quot;could allow gangs to overrun the entire metropolitan area&quot; of the capital Port-au-Prince.</p><p>Haiti&#39;s Foreign Minister Jean-Victor Harvel Jean-Baptiste, speaking at a meeting of the UN Security Council, has said that the country faced &quot;major difficulties&quot; that threaten not just the population but also &quot;the very survival of the state.&quot;</p><p>The MSS is not a UN force, but the UN has set up a voluntary fund to finance it, which has raised $110 million to date, an amount that has been deemed largely insufficient.</p><p>Just under 800 of the 2,500 security personnel hoped for have been deployed.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore

transferred $15 million to the fund -- the second-largest contribution, after Canada&#39;s $63 million -- with $1.7 million already disbursed.</p><p>In parallel with the UN-hosted fund, the United States, then headed by Joe Biden, had contributed over $300 million in funds and equipment directly to the MSS, including dozens of armored vehicles.</p><p>Haiti currently has no president or parliament and is ruled by a transitional body, which is struggling to manage extreme violence linked to criminal gangs, poverty and other challenges.</p><p>More than 5,626 people were killed in Haiti last year as a result of gang violence, about a thousand more than in 2023, the UN said.</p><p>More than a million Haitians have been forced to flee their homes, three times as many as a year
