The company has produced an average operating margin of 8.3%, higher than the broader industrials sector.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Looking at the trend in its profitability, Stanley Black &amp; Decker’s operating margin decreased by 6.5 percentage points over the last five years.

Since Stanley Black &amp; Decker’s operating margin decreased more than its gross margin, we can assume it was recently less efficient because expenses such as marketing, R&amp;D, and administrative overhead increased.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <h2 class=\"header-scroll yf-gn6wdt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Earnings Per Share<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h2> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Sadly for Stanley Black &amp; Decker, its EPS declined by 12.7% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 1.2%.

As we mentioned earlier, Stanley Black &amp; Decker’s operating margin declined by 6.5 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its lower earnings; taxes and interest expenses can also affect EPS but don’t tell us as much about a company’s fundamentals.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a shorter period to see if we are missing a change in the business.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->For Stanley Black &amp; Decker, its two-year annual EPS declines of 2.9% show it’s still underperforming. These results were bad no matter how you slice the data.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In Q4, Stanley Black &amp; Decker reported EPS at $1.40, up from $0.92 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts’ estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Stanley Black &amp; Decker’s full-year EPS of $4.27 to grow 21%.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <h2 class=\"header-scroll yf-gn6wdt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Key Takeaways from Stanley Black &amp; Decker’s Q4 Results<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h2> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We were impressed by how significantly Stanley Black &amp; Decker blew past analysts’ organic revenue expectations this quarter. We were also excited its revenue outperformed Wall Street’s estimates by a wide margin. On the other hand, its full-year EPS guidance missed significantly. Overall, we think this was a mixed quarter. The stock traded down 3.7% to $83.50 immediately after reporting.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->So should you invest in Stanley Black &amp; Decker right now?
