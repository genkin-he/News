Hapag-Lloyd is expected to grow slightly above the industry average, he added. The company's Gemini co-operation with Danish peer Maersk started on Feb. 1, bringing together a network of 340 ships on seven trade corridors. In preliminary earnings for 2024 issued last week, the company said it saw earnings quadruple in the fourth quarter, contributing to a slight rise in annual profit.
