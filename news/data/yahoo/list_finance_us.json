It is therefore pleasing to see Euan Sutherland, its chief executive, report that the FTSE 250 index member’s operating margin rose to 13.5pc in the year to January, exceeding analysts’ consensus forecast of 13.2pc and last year’s 12.3pc mark.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The return on sales is still below 2018’s peak of 17.1pc but the plan is that profit margins will expand as sales increase and cost efficiencies are realised from the integration of the Boost acquisition and a switch in sales channels.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->All other things being equal, improved profits should boost cash flow and that will bolster AG Barr’s already healthy balance sheet, which carries a net cash pile of more than £60m, with a pension surplus for good measure.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Such solid finances permit AG Barr to invest in and protect its competitive position in the face of multiple challenges and also reward shareholders for their support with dividends. Analysts expect a 10pc increase in the total dividend to 16.5p for the year to January 2025, with a further 12pc advance to 18.3p in the coming year.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Those figures equate to forecast forward dividend yields of 2.7pc and 3.0pc, respectively.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->They may not catch the eye of income-seekers, given that 10-year gilts yield 4.6pc. But over the past decade, AG Barr has still paid out 108p a share in dividends – despite Covid and lockdowns – and the next two years alone offer the prospect of a nearly 35p a share in additional payments.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The Dunbartonshire-based company may therefore merit further patient support from investors. The shares do not look like an outright bargain on 18 times earnings for fiscal 2025 – but 14 times for 2026 looks more enticing, if analysts’ profit forecasts prove accurate, given the earnings momentum, margin profile, cash flow and rock-solid balance sheet.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <div class=\"readmore yf-103i3cu\"><button aria-label=\"Story Continues\" class=\"secondary-btn fin-size-large readmore-button rounded yf-15mk0m\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;itc:1;sec:content-canvas;slk:Story%20Continues\" title=\"Story Continues\"> <span>Story Continues</span> </button> </div> <div class=\"read-more-wrapper\" data-testid=\"read-more\" style=\"display: none\"> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>Questor says: buy</strong><br/><strong>Ticker: BAG</strong><br/><strong>Share price: 618p</strong><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <h2 class=\"header-scroll yf-gn6wdt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Update: Hargreaves Services<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h2> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Relying on government policy to translate smoothly into investment portfolio profits is rarely wise, given the scope for delays, poor execution and political U-turns. But if any company neatly taps into the themes currently championed by the Labour administration it may just be Hargreaves Services.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The Durham-headquartered company is an expert in long-term infrastructure projects and the regeneration of brownfield land for commercial or residential property development, and its latest interim results suggest it is capitalising on these skills.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->First-half sales, profits and dividends were all up. Management stated that revenues for the full year to May 2025 looked set to exceed forecasts, thanks to strong demand in services, where framework contracts on projects such as the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Lower Thames Crossing project;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/01/15/thames-crossing-plan-uk-biggest-planning-application/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lower Thames Crossing project</a> and the Sizewell C nuclear power plant underpin much of the activity.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->A delay in the completion of a residential land sale near Edinburgh means annual profits will match consensus forecasts, but excellent visibility from the services arm and a return to the black at a German joint venture in raw materials and recycling – HRMS – helped management to increase the interim dividend by nearly 3pc to 18.5p a share.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The only slight concern is valuation. The shares trade at a 10-year high and above the first-half <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:net asset value (Nav);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/stocks-shares/book-value-what-is-how-calculate-it/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">net asset value (Nav)</a> per share figure of 580p, after a lengthy period of trading at a hefty discount. Growth in Nav has stalled a little but higher interest rates will have had a role to play there. Lower borrowing costs and further increases in profitability could help Nav resume its growth trajectory.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Moreover, if Hargreaves Services repeats the interim dividend at the final stage, that would give a total distribution for the year to May 2025 of 37p a share. That equates to a dividend yield of 5.6pc, so investors can wait patiently for Hargreaves Services to optimise returns from its multi-year infrastructure deals and land bank.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>Questor says: hold</strong><br/><strong>Ticker: HSP:AIM</strong><br/><strong>Share price: 624p</strong><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><em>Read the latest Questor column on </em><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:telegraph.co.uk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"http://telegraph.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>telegraph.co.uk</em></a><em> every weekday at 5am.

The startup amassed a million users within three months of its public beta and is currently making \"millions of dollars\" in profit, Raghavendra said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Before Presentations.ai, Raghvendra founded Deck App Technologies, which developed an app to help people create business content using smartphones. However, he noted that the earlier venture had a \"limited degree of success\" as mobile devices did not become an instrument to create content other than videos.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Over the years, Raghvendra said that his team had created IPs around building presentations that helped Presentations.ai to emerge as a competitive player even in the crowded space where both <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:startups;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/20/prezent-ai-secures-20m-to-gamify-deck-presentations/\">startups</a> and even <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:big tech companies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/microsoft-launches-its-ai-presentation-coach-for-powerpoint/\">big tech companies</a> like Google and Microsoft are trying to ease presentation-building using generative AI.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->\"Because we have been doing this for so many years, I'm fairly confident that we are far ahead of anybody else, and the proof of the pudding for us is that a lot of users who come in pay us to use our software. They have typically tried other competitors, including whatever Google or Microsoft has,\" Raghvendra asserted.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->After gaining initial traction, the startup transitioned from a completely free experience for beta testers into a freemium offering in early 2024. Since then, Raghvendra told TechCrunch it has \"tens of thousands\" of paying users who pay for its service, starting at an annual price of $200 per user in the U.S., with different tiers and localized pricing across markets.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <div class=\"readmore yf-103i3cu\"><button aria-label=\"Story Continues\" class=\"secondary-btn fin-size-large readmore-button rounded yf-15mk0m\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;itc:1;sec:content-canvas;slk:Story%20Continues\" title=\"Story Continues\"> <span>Story Continues</span> </button> </div> <div class=\"read-more-wrapper\" data-testid=\"read-more\" style=\"display: none\"> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The startup utilizes \"frontier\" LLMs along with its own small language models created for specific tasks, such as deciding which chart best fits a particular topic. It also uses text-to-image models Flux and Stable Diffusion to help users quickly generate images to be used in the presentations with prompts.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Presentations.ai provides tools including theme palettes and presentation styles to generate decks based on user preferences. It also offers features including an AI-powered design assistant to create presentations based on different ideas, sharing and real-time sync, and multilingual support.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Similarly, the startup provides brand templates to match the style of users' particular brands. It also lets people export their presentations to a PowerPoint file for further editing or as a PDF.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Presentations.ai specifically includes \"guardrails\" to assure enterprise customers it has a high bar against the competition. These guardrails, Raghvendra said, are built using the data pipelines the startup has built over time to restrict hallucination, the colloquial term of AI-generated inaccurate or misleading content. The platform also lets enterprises restrict access to sensitive data they do not want to be shared with other users, such as the financial information with the CFO that the front-line staff should not access.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The startup also allows hosting a private instance of the software. Additionally, it provides organization-wide licenses to let employees collaborate on a particular presentation.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Raghvendra told TechCrunch the startup plans to use the seed funding to launch a dedicated presentation agent to create presentations within any application. It also plans to have an enterprise sales team.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->So far, Raghvendra said the startup has spent \"zero\" on its marketing. Also, since it owns IPs, the executive said its AI patent costs are relatively lower and have higher profitability margins than other startups enabling presentations using AI.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The startup gets 20% of its revenues from the U.S. followed by India.
