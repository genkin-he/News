Still, it has ambitions for sharp increases in LNG exports in coming years under Trump, with China, the world's biggest importer of the fuel, seen as a potential customer for even more.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Saul Kavonic, an energy analyst at MST Marquee, said China bought around 10% of U.S. LNG exports last year.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->China's tariffs will drive more U.S. volumes to Europe and benefit other regional producers such as Australia, he said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->\"The negative impact on U.S. LNG from these tariffs will only partly offset the strong appetite from other buyers to procure more U.S. LNG under pressure from Trump to rebalance trade deficits,” he said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->CRUDE COSTS<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Mia Geng, an analyst at FGE, said that when China imposed 25% tariffs on U.S. crude during the trade war in Trump's first administration, China stopped its purchases of 300,000-400,000 barrels per day of U.S. crude and turned to alternatives such as West Africa and Asian supply.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->\"We are still assessing this internally but it looks like we will see a pause in buying while light-sweet alternatives will be sought after. This impacts about 100,000 bpd of recent U.S. inflows, which is not a big amount for Chinese refiners,\" she said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The tariffs will make flows of U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude into China expensive relative to alternatives such as Kazakhstan's CPC and Abu Dhabi's Murban grades, said Sparta Commodities analyst June Goh.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <div class=\"readmore yf-103i3cu\"><button aria-label=\"Story Continues\" class=\"secondary-btn fin-size-large readmore-button rounded yf-15mk0m\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;itc:1;sec:content-canvas;slk:Story%20Continues\" title=\"Story Continues\"> <span>Story Continues</span> </button> </div> <div class=\"read-more-wrapper\" data-testid=\"read-more\" style=\"display: none\"> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->\"However, in the big scheme of things, this should not impact the price of WTI significantly as WTI can still flow to other regions easily,\" Goh said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->IG market strategist Yeap Jun Rong said China's tariffs may be seen as a sign of escalation, reducing the chances of a temporary resolution with Washington of the kind that Canada and Mexico reached at the last-minute to delay U.S. measures.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->\"As such, broader risk sentiments pare down some optimism amid the changing dynamics, with oil prices extending losses further. Market participants are back to price for potential downside risks to global growth in the event of further tit-for-tat measures from both U.S. and China,\" he said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->As for coal, China is not a big importer from the United States, but the value of shipments of coking coal - used mainly in steelmaking - rose by nearly a third to $1.84 billion in 2024, China customs data showed.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->(Reporting by Tony Munroe, Florence Tan, Trixie Yap, Emily Chow, Sudarshan Varadhan, Siyi Liu and Chen Aizhu; Editing by Kim Coghill)<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></div>  </div>",
