Income from operations for the fourth-quarter was $770 million, well below the average estimate of $1.2 billion. “Discrete legal and regulatory related matters” offset income gains from a “strong operating performance,” Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi said in a prepared statement.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Gross bookings, which includes ride hails, delivery orders and driver and merchant earnings but not tips, grew 18% to $44.2 billion in the last three months of 2024. For the current quarter, it forecast bookings of $42 billion to $43.5 billion. Bloomberg’s data included one analyst estimate for gross bookings for the fourth and first quarters.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In prepared remarks, Chief Financial Officer Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah cited continued currency headwinds, as well as impact from the recent Los Angeles fires and “extreme weather in January.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Shares of Uber fell 3% during premarket trading after the results were announced.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Uber’s US flagship rideshare business, which accounts for more than half of its profitability, has lately been weighed down by rising insurance prices. Executives have blamed these expenses for slowing demand ride demand, saying it’s had to pass higher costs on to consumers in certain markets such as New Jersey, Southern California and parts of Florida.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Khosrowshahi has since publicly vowed to push for insurance and tort reform to address the issue. The company has gone on the offensive in New York, filing a racketeering lawsuit against a group of law firms, doctors and clinics it claims staged fake car accidents to take advantage of insurance policies.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In his prepared statement, Khosrowshahi said the company has made “significant progress in slowing insurance price increases through a combination of tech innovation and strong policy work.” Yet the company will continue to pass on those rising costs to consumers and expects UberX prices in the US to be “up marginally” in 2025.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <div class=\"readmore yf-103i3cu\"><button aria-label=\"Story Continues\" class=\"secondary-btn fin-size-large readmore-button rounded yf-15mk0m\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;itc:1;sec:content-canvas;slk:Story%20Continues\" title=\"Story Continues\"> <span>Story Continues</span> </button> </div> <div class=\"read-more-wrapper\" data-testid=\"read-more\" style=\"display: none\"> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Diversifying Revenue<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Meanwhile, Uber has been pushing into new growth areas across its global mobility and delivery businesses. It has launched more affordable options such as shuttle rides in New York and pooled rides at airports.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The company is also working on a $2.99-a-month pass feature to let commuters secure prices for frequent rides ahead of time, Bloomberg reported last month. This subscription offering would represent a potential new revenue source if Uber decides to move forward with the plan. Additionally, the firm has begun selling data labeling services to other businesses by leaning on its gig-worker platform, Bloomberg reported last year.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Uber continues to partner with other brands to boost user growth. Last month, it announced an exclusive, multiyear deal with Delta Air Lines Inc., ending rival Lyft Inc.’s prior deal with the air carrier that allowed riders to earn miles on ground trips. Separately, the Uber Eats unit recently struck a partnership with Home Depot Inc., allowing customers to arrange deliveries for things beyond just restaurant orders.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Autonomous vehicles have also been an increasing area of focus for Uber, which inked more than a dozen manufacturer partnerships and has invested in multiple self-driving technology companies. Earlier Wednesday, the rideshare giant announced it has opened a waitlist for customers in Austin to indicate interest in Waymo rides ahead of an expected launch in March. The company will also be the sole app offering Waymo rides in Atlanta this summer. The tie-up is part of a longer-term vision to become the go-to platform for automakers to monetize their self-driving vehicles.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“Even as we see AV technology advancing, we expect AV commercialization will take significantly longer,” Khosrowshahi said in the prepared statement, citing the need for an operator to balance a consistent safety record, on-the-ground logistics and managing a high-utilization marketplace. “Given the scale of the Uber platform, and human drivers’ ability to dynamically fulfill demand spikes—and take a break during demand troughs—partnering with Uber allows AV players to move much faster than they could on their own.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <ul class=\"yf-1woyvo2\"><li class=\"yf-1woyvo2\"> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Amazon and SpaceX Want In on India’s Satellite Internet Market;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-04/musk-ambani-want-to-sell-millions-of-indians-satellite-internet?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon and SpaceX Want In on India’s Satellite Internet Market</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </li><li class=\"yf-1woyvo2\"> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Elon Musk Inside the Treasury Department Payment System;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-02/elon-musk-gets-inside-treasury-department-payment-system?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Elon Musk Inside the Treasury Department Payment System</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </li><li class=\"yf-1woyvo2\"> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Inside Elon Musk’s Attack on the US Government;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-04/podcast-inside-elon-musk-s-attack-on-the-us-government?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Inside Elon Musk’s Attack on the US Government</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </li><li class=\"yf-1woyvo2\"> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:The NFL’s Flawed DEI Program Still Beats What Most Companies Are Doing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-04/nfl-s-rooney-rule-is-a-dei-program-that-beats-what-most-companies-are-doing?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The NFL’s Flawed DEI Program Still Beats What Most Companies Are Doing</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </li><li class=\"yf-1woyvo2\"> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:The Internet Almost Killed Barnes &amp; Noble, Then Saved It;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-30/barnes-noble-sales-are-growing-again-thanks-to-booktok-buzz?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Internet Almost Killed Barnes &amp; Noble, Then Saved It</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->©2025 Bloomberg L.P.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></div>  </div>",

The company has produced an average operating margin of 8.3%, higher than the broader industrials sector.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Looking at the trend in its profitability, Stanley Black &amp; Decker’s operating margin decreased by 6.5 percentage points over the last five years. Even though its historical margin is high, shareholders will want to see Stanley Black &amp; Decker become more profitable in the future.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <figure class=\"yf-8xybrv\"><div class=\"image-container yf-g633g8 loader\" style=\"--max-height: 540px;\"> <div class=\"image-wrapper yf-g633g8\" style=\"--aspect-ratio: 960 / 540; --img-max-width: 960px;\"><img alt=\"Stanley Black &amp;amp; Decker Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP)\" class=\"yf-g633g8 loader\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///ywAAAAAAQABAAACAUwAOw==\" width=\"960\"/></div></div> <figcaption class=\"yf-8xybrv\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Stanley Black &amp; Decker Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP)<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In Q4, Stanley Black &amp; Decker generated an operating profit margin of 5.4%, down 1.9 percentage points year on year. Since Stanley Black &amp; Decker’s operating margin decreased more than its gross margin, we can assume it was recently less efficient because expenses such as marketing, R&amp;D, and administrative overhead increased.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <h2 class=\"header-scroll yf-gn6wdt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Earnings Per Share<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h2> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Sadly for Stanley Black &amp; Decker, its EPS declined by 12.7% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 1.2%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <figure class=\"yf-8xybrv\"><div class=\"image-container yf-g633g8 loader\" style=\"--max-height: 540px;\"> <div class=\"image-wrapper yf-g633g8\" style=\"--aspect-ratio: 960 / 540; --img-max-width: 960px;\"><img alt=\"Stanley Black &amp;amp; Decker Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP)\" class=\"yf-g633g8 loader\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///ywAAAAAAQABAAACAUwAOw==\" width=\"960\"/></div></div> <figcaption class=\"yf-8xybrv\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Stanley Black &amp; Decker Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP)<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Diving into the nuances of Stanley Black &amp; Decker’s earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Stanley Black &amp; Decker’s operating margin declined by 6.5 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its lower earnings; taxes and interest expenses can also affect EPS but don’t tell us as much about a company’s fundamentals.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a shorter period to see if we are missing a change in the business.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->For Stanley Black &amp; Decker, its two-year annual EPS declines of 2.9% show it’s still underperforming. These results were bad no matter how you slice the data.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In Q4, Stanley Black &amp; Decker reported EPS at $1.40, up from $0.92 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts’ estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Stanley Black &amp; Decker’s full-year EPS of $4.27 to grow 21%.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <h2 class=\"header-scroll yf-gn6wdt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Key Takeaways from Stanley Black &amp; Decker’s Q4 Results<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h2> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We were impressed by how significantly Stanley Black &amp; Decker blew past analysts’ organic revenue expectations this quarter. We were also excited its revenue outperformed Wall Street’s estimates by a wide margin. On the other hand, its full-year EPS guidance missed significantly. Overall, we think this was a mixed quarter. The stock traded down 3.7% to $83.50 immediately after reporting.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->So should you invest in Stanley Black &amp; Decker right now?
