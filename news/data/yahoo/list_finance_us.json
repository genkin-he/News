He also owns property worth £750,000 in Cornwall and Plymouth, and has £140,000 in a stocks and shares Isa – though it has suffered negative growth in recent years – along with £50,000 in a Venture Capital Trust (VCT). These typically invest in small businesses, offering a lower tax rate and the potential of stronger returns in exchange for heightened risk.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Dr O’Sullivan adds: “I now have a significant element of income that supported my mortgage payments without a corresponding mortgage. It could be Christmas every month!<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“In recent years, I have kept my income just below £100,000 a year so as not to sacrifice my personal allowance.

But what Dr O’Sullivan is missing is a clear underlying plan or strategy based on his specific goals, circumstances and timeline.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->For the top goal of wealth preservation, there is a Sipp not listed as a source of current income. Firstly, saying it is “falling fast” suggests that it is not invested correctly. Providing Dr O’Sullivan has not started taking an income and only removed the tax-free cash, it’s possible to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:make pension contributions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/pensions/private-pensions/how-to-make-pension-contributions-to-lower-your-tax-bill/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">make pension contributions</a> of up to £60,000 a year from his companies. This would tick three boxes: strengthen the goal of providing future income of £100k or more, reduce annual corporation tax and allow him to take money out of the businesses tax-free – win-win! But this only works until the age of 75, so Dr O’Sullivan will want to make the most of this tax benefit now.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->It is great that Dr O’Sullivan is aware of the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:60pc tax trap between £100,000 and £125,140;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/tax/income/labour-60pc-tax-trap-fast-becoming-new-normal/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">60pc tax trap between £100,000 and £125,140</a>, where you lose the personal allowance and are therefore exposed to income tax of 20pc on top of 40pc, and so has planned his income around this. It goes without saying, but I hope that as a higher rate taxpayer he has also claimed the additional 20pc from the Government for any personal pension payments.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Regarding the Isa he has stopped paying into, he says this has had negative growth so I would question the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:asset allocation of his investments;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/isas/investment-isa-stocks-shares-what-banking-eligibility/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">asset allocation of his investments</a>. As mentioned, one key benefit of an Isa is that there is no tax on any growth within the wrapper. There is also no tax on withdrawals, so if Dr O’Sullivan maximises his £20,000 annual allowance this could help with his goal of tax-free income in future years.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->He is invested in a VCT, in which he benefits from initial and ongoing tax reliefs, such as 30pc income tax relief and tax-free dividends after five years. It may also be worth investing in <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:enterprise investment schemes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/stocks-shares/eis-enterprise-investment-scheme/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">enterprise investment schemes</a> (EIS). These products help with capital gains tax and the allowable investment amount is much higher at £1m (or £2m for knowledge-intensive companies) vs £200,000 for a VCT.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->It is also worth exploring using the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:gift allowance in relation to inheritance tax;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/tax/inheritance/inheritance-tax-gifts-surplus-income-unlimited-gifting/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gift allowance in relation to inheritance tax</a>. This could take various forms, such as using the annual £3,000 gift allowance or contributing into Junior Isas (£9,000 a year for each child) and junior pensions (£3,600 a year each, gross) for grandchildren – a lovely way of passing funds on to future generations. It is also worth considering trusts such as a Discounted Gift Plan or a Loan Plan.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->I understand it can feel like the only solution to all the UK taxes is to move abroad, but with the correct planning in place, there is a way for Dr O’Sullivan to achieve his goals whilst minimising his tax liabilities.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <h2 class=\"header-scroll yf-gn6wdt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Felix Milton, financial adviser, Philip J Milton &amp; Co<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h2> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Dr O’Sullivan has been very successful throughout his career, and the business assets he has accumulated prove it. By his own admission, Dr O’Sullivan has a lower amount in personal assets than would perhaps be expected for someone with the level of wealth he has, owing to a desire to avoid paying personal taxes on any withdrawals from the companies.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Dr O’Sullivan has noted that the easiest way for him to avoid large taxes on his wealth would be to sell everything and emigrate completely to a lower tax jurisdiction, where he wouldn’t be at risk of UK inheritance tax.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->This, of course, would leave him with a rather large capital gains tax bill to pay – though this could be mitigated to some extent if Dr O’Sullivan invested the proceeds into enterprise investment schemes and seed enterprise investment schemes.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The former allows you to defer any gain and the latter allows you to benefit from reinvestment relief, meaning that some of the gain would be treated as <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:exempt from capital gains tax;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/tax/capital-gains/capital-gains-tax-how-to-cut-your-bill/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">exempt from capital gains tax</a>. He would also be able to benefit from large income tax reliefs from making these investments, though there are limits to what he could invest in any one year.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->He could also explore the option of giving as gifts some of his assets now to the beneficiaries of his estate. Providing he lives for seven years, these assets will be exempted from future inheritance tax. However, he may still have capital gains tax to pay on some of the disposals, unless he can claim gift hold-over relief, which allows you to not pay capital gains tax on the assets and instead the person you give them to pays on their disposal.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Likewise, the gig economy sprang up in a similar fashion, with a proliferation of tech-enabled freelance labor marketplaces, which work hand and hand with many on demand services. Individuals can now work on demand too. What began with tech-enabled platforms that aggregated riders and drivers has expanded over the past decade to include food delivery, groceries, and now even a plumber or graphic designer are all just a few taps away.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <h2 class=\"header-scroll yf-gn6wdt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Sales Growth<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h2> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->A company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. While any business can experience short-term success, top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years.

This isn’t great, but the increase in monthly active platform consumers is more relevant for assessing long-term business potential. We’ll monitor the situation closely; if Uber tries boosting ARPU by taking a more aggressive approach to monetization, it’s unclear whether users can continue growing at the current pace.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <figure class=\"yf-8xybrv\"><div class=\"image-container yf-g633g8 loader\" style=\"--max-height: 540px;\"> <div class=\"image-wrapper yf-g633g8\" style=\"--aspect-ratio: 960 / 540; --img-max-width: 960px;\"><img alt=\"Uber ARPU\" class=\"yf-g633g8 loader\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///ywAAAAAAQABAAACAUwAOw==\" width=\"960\"/></div></div> <figcaption class=\"yf-8xybrv\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Uber ARPU<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->This quarter, Uber’s ARPU clocked in at $69.94.

The company has produced an average operating margin of 8.3%, higher than the broader industrials sector.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Looking at the trend in its profitability, Stanley Black &amp; Decker’s operating margin decreased by 6.5 percentage points over the last five years.

Since Stanley Black &amp; Decker’s operating margin decreased more than its gross margin, we can assume it was recently less efficient because expenses such as marketing, R&amp;D, and administrative overhead increased.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <h2 class=\"header-scroll yf-gn6wdt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Earnings Per Share<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h2> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Sadly for Stanley Black &amp; Decker, its EPS declined by 12.7% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 1.2%.

As we mentioned earlier, Stanley Black &amp; Decker’s operating margin declined by 6.5 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its lower earnings; taxes and interest expenses can also affect EPS but don’t tell us as much about a company’s fundamentals.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a shorter period to see if we are missing a change in the business.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->For Stanley Black &amp; Decker, its two-year annual EPS declines of 2.9% show it’s still underperforming. These results were bad no matter how you slice the data.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In Q4, Stanley Black &amp; Decker reported EPS at $1.40, up from $0.92 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts’ estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Stanley Black &amp; Decker’s full-year EPS of $4.27 to grow 21%.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <h2 class=\"header-scroll yf-gn6wdt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Key Takeaways from Stanley Black &amp; Decker’s Q4 Results<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h2> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We were impressed by how significantly Stanley Black &amp; Decker blew past analysts’ organic revenue expectations this quarter. We were also excited its revenue outperformed Wall Street’s estimates by a wide margin. On the other hand, its full-year EPS guidance missed significantly. Overall, we think this was a mixed quarter.
