More specific pockets of strong demand include Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity and the 5G telecom upgrade cycle, which can benefit companies whose cables and conduits fit those needs. But like the broader industrials sector, these companies are also at the whim of economic cycles. Interest rates, for example, can greatly impact projects that drive demand for these products.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <h2 class=\"header-scroll yf-gn6wdt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Sales Growth<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h2> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->A company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. While any business can experience short-term success, top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Regrettably, Kimball Electronics’s sales grew at a tepid 4.8% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years.

It’s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Kimball Electronics was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 4.4% was weak for an industrials business. This result isn’t too surprising given its low gross margin as a starting point.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Looking at the trend in its profitability, Kimball Electronics’s operating margin might have seen some fluctuations but has generally stayed the same over the last five years, which doesn’t help its cause.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <figure class=\"yf-8xybrv\"><div class=\"image-container yf-g633g8 loader\" style=\"--max-height: 540px;\"> <div class=\"image-wrapper yf-g633g8\" style=\"--aspect-ratio: 960 / 540; --img-max-width: 960px;\"><img alt=\"Kimball Electronics Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP)\" class=\"yf-g633g8 loader\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///ywAAAAAAQABAAACAUwAOw==\" width=\"960\"/></div></div> <figcaption class=\"yf-8xybrv\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Kimball Electronics Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP)<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In Q4, Kimball Electronics generated an operating profit margin of 2.3%, down 1.8 percentage points year on year. Since Kimball Electronics’s operating margin decreased more than its gross margin, we can assume it was recently less efficient because expenses such as marketing, R&amp;D, and administrative overhead increased.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <h2 class=\"header-scroll yf-gn6wdt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Earnings Per Share<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h2> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Kimball Electronics’s full-year EPS dropped 49.2%, or 10.5% annually, over the last four years. We tend to steer our readers away from companies with falling revenue and EPS, where diminishing earnings could imply changing secular trends and preferences. If the tide turns unexpectedly, Kimball Electronics’s low margin of safety could leave its stock price susceptible to large downswings.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <figure class=\"yf-8xybrv\"><div class=\"image-container yf-g633g8 loader\" style=\"--max-height: 540px;\"> <div class=\"image-wrapper yf-g633g8\" style=\"--aspect-ratio: 960 / 540; --img-max-width: 960px;\"><img alt=\"Kimball Electronics Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP)\" class=\"yf-g633g8 loader\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///ywAAAAAAQABAAACAUwAOw==\" width=\"960\"/></div></div> <figcaption class=\"yf-8xybrv\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Kimball Electronics Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP)<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Sadly for Kimball Electronics, its EPS declined by 18.1% annually over the last two years while its revenue was flat. This tells us the company struggled to adjust to choppy demand.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We can take a deeper look into Kimball Electronics’s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. Kimball Electronics’s operating margin has declined by 2 percentage points over the last two years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its lower earnings; taxes and interest expenses can also affect EPS but don’t tell us as much about a company’s fundamentals.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In Q4, Kimball Electronics reported EPS at $0.29, down from $0.33 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print easily cleared analysts’ estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Kimball Electronics’s full-year EPS of $1.18 to grow 32.6%.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <h2 class=\"header-scroll yf-gn6wdt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Key Takeaways from Kimball Electronics’s Q4 Results<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h2> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Kimball Electronics's revenue in the quarter missed. Adding to the bad news was the company's lowering of its full-year revenue and operating margin guidance, which fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this was a softer quarter. The stock traded down 4.5% to $17.06 immediately after reporting.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The latest quarter from Kimball Electronics’s wasn’t that good. One earnings report doesn’t define a company’s quality, though, so let’s explore whether the stock is a buy at the current price. We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy. <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it’s free;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://stockstory.org/stocks/nasdaq/ke?utm_source=earningsArticle&amp;utm_medium=yahoo&amp;utm_campaign=end1&amp;utm_article=Dlh2b24PYQ%3D%3D&amp;utm_ticker=KE\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it’s free</a>.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></div>  </div>",

Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Carlisle’s EPS grew at a spectacular 16.2% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its flat revenue.

As we mentioned earlier, Carlisle’s operating margin declined this quarter but expanded by 11.5 percentage points over the last five years. Its share count also shrank by 20.5%, and these factors together are positive signs for shareholders because improving profitability and share buybacks turbocharge EPS growth relative to revenue growth.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <figure class=\"yf-8xybrv\"><div class=\"image-container yf-g633g8 loader\" style=\"--max-height: 540px;\"> <div class=\"image-wrapper yf-g633g8\" style=\"--aspect-ratio: 960 / 540; --img-max-width: 960px;\"><img alt=\"Carlisle Diluted Shares Outstanding\" class=\"yf-g633g8 loader\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///ywAAAAAAQABAAACAUwAOw==\" width=\"960\"/></div></div> <figcaption class=\"yf-8xybrv\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Carlisle Diluted Shares Outstanding<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->For Carlisle, its two-year annual EPS growth of 5.3% was lower than its five-year trend. We hope its growth can accelerate in the future.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In Q4, Carlisle reported EPS at $4.47, up from $4.18 in the same quarter last year.

Overall, there were any resounding positives in these results. The stock traded down 1.9% to $369 immediately following the results.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Carlisle underperformed this quarter, but does that create an opportunity to invest right now?
