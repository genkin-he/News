Panasonic will integrate artificial intelligence technology across its operations and team up with Anthropic to boost AI-related revenue, he said in a recent interview. One area that the company has been targeting is data centers’ growing need for high-efficiency and heat-resistant components and materials.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Once a global leader in consumer electronics, Panasonic is now a key battery supplier to Tesla.

Operating profit in 4Q could remain high, after climbing 4% in 3Q. Its energy division operating profit could rise due to battery demand from data-center customers, while production efficiency can improve in its US factory. Industry-division profit could increase due to robust demand for electronic parts and materials for generative AI. Lifestyle-division profit could stabilize due to cost control, while Panasonic’s connect unit profit could also be stable due to cost-management capabilities, including Blue Yonder’s supply chain solutions.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->-Masahiro Wakasugi, senior industry analyst<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Click here for research<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->--With assistance from Aya Wagatsuma.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->(Updates with share reaction and analyst commentary)<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <ul class=\"yf-1woyvo2\"><li class=\"yf-1woyvo2\"> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Amazon and SpaceX Want In on India’s Satellite Internet Market;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-04/musk-ambani-want-to-sell-millions-of-indians-satellite-internet?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon and SpaceX Want In on India’s Satellite Internet Market</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </li><li class=\"yf-1woyvo2\"> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Elon Musk Inside the Treasury Department Payment System;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-02/elon-musk-gets-inside-treasury-department-payment-system?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Elon Musk Inside the Treasury Department Payment System</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </li><li class=\"yf-1woyvo2\"> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Inside Elon Musk’s Attack on the US Government;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-04/podcast-inside-elon-musk-s-attack-on-the-us-government?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Inside Elon Musk’s Attack on the US Government</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </li><li class=\"yf-1woyvo2\"> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:The NFL’s Flawed DEI Program Still Beats What Most Companies Are Doing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-04/nfl-s-rooney-rule-is-a-dei-program-that-beats-what-most-companies-are-doing?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The NFL’s Flawed DEI Program Still Beats What Most Companies Are Doing</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </li><li class=\"yf-1woyvo2\"> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:The Internet Almost Killed Barnes &amp; Noble, Then Saved It;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-30/barnes-noble-sales-are-growing-again-thanks-to-booktok-buzz?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Internet Almost Killed Barnes &amp; Noble, Then Saved It</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->©2025 Bloomberg L.P.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></div>  </div>",

It came under greater scrutiny in recent years due to the rapidly growing number of low-cost items coming into the U.S. from China, mainly from prominent China-founded online retailers such as Shein, Temu and Alibaba’s AliExpress.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Former President Joe Biden’s administration proposed a crackdown on the loophole in September, but the rules did not take effect before Biden left office.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Shein and Temu have gained global popularity by offering a quickly updated assortment of ultra-inexpensive clothes, accessories, gifts and gadgets shipped mostly from China, allowing the two e-commerce companies to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:compete on the home turf;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/shein-temu-holiday-shopping-discounts-2d551895e123dedd49fa35ec58d07634\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">compete on the home turf</a> of American companies.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Seattle-based Amazon is trying to compete with them through an online storefront that mimics their business model by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:offering cheap products;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/amazon-temu-shein-discount-store-336a6c7c0b31d601f4460946fc8a6f61\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">offering cheap products</a> shipped directly from China.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Chinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to report released last week by the Congressional Research Service. In the U.S., Temu and Shein comprise about 17% of the discount market for fast fashion, toys and other consumer goods, the report said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->How much will prices go up?<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->It’s unclear. Under de minimis, Shein, Temu and AliExpress could bypass taxes collected by customs authorities. But under the changes effective Tuesday, company shipments from China will now be subject to existing duties plus the new 10% tariff imposed by Trump, analysts said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“The vast majority of these orders are valued less than $800, which means all or virtually all of them are going to get caught in that,” Youssef Squali, an analyst at Truist Financial, said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, said he thinks the price increases on platforms like Shein and Temu will be “pretty small” and the products they sell will remain cheap. However, the rule change is likely to result in delivery delays since the packages now have to go through customs, Kaziukenas said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The new tariffs will also hit third-party sellers on Amazon that import products from China, according to Squali. He expects sellers to eat some of the costs and pass the rest onto customers, which he thinks could result in percentage price increases in the mid-single digits. Other e-commerce sites that host businesses, such as Etsy, are also going to be impacted, Squali said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Temu, which is owned by China’s PDD Holdings, has previously said its growth did not depend on the de minimis policy. Though most of its products are shipped from China, Temu has been recruiting Chinese merchants to store inventory in the U.S., a move that experts said would allow it to not be as exposed to changes around the trade rule.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In January, China also introduced measures to help cross-border e-commerce build overseas warehousing by offering them tax rebates or tax exemptions<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->What are US retailers saying?<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The day after November's U.S. presidential election, Brieane Olson, CEO of teen clothing chain PacSun, went to Hong Kong to meet with factory executives to figure out ways to prepare for Trump’s tariff plan.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Roughly 35% to 40% of PacSun’s garments are made in China, even as the chain has accelerated moves to diversify with suppliers in countries like Cambodia and Vietnam.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But Olson said Trump's 10% tariff on Chinese goods was less extreme than the company anticipated. For now, PacSun doesn’t plan to increase prices on its products or move its manufacturing of knitwear and denim out of China.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Toys are another category of consumer products that relies heavily on imports from China. Greg Ahearn, the president and CEO of The Toy Association trade group, said he thinks toy companies that source in China are going to absorb the cost of the new tariff in the short term.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Eventually, those price hikes will be moved onto the consumer, Ahearn said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->___<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Associated Press writers Anne D’Innocenzio in New York, and Christopher Rugaber and Didi Tang in Washington contributed to this report.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></div>  </div>",
