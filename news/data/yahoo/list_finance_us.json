Cloud revenue grew 30% — decelerating from +35% in 3Q — and Google noted that it is capacity constrained as demand outstrips supply, in theory a good problem to have. In terms of costs &amp; margins, 4Q operating income margin of 32.1% was a bit light, but still reflected 465bps of year over year margin expansion (+325bps excl. 1x items). The bigger question is whether Google can continue to expand margins in 2025 given likely slower revenue growth and accelerating depreciation.

<p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->For example, Tesla has publicly complained about high taxes on imported EVs and Volkswagen last week sued over a demand for a record $1.4 billion in back

flagging alleged tax evasion of 13.5 billion rupees, according to a government notice Reuters is reporting for the first time.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The offence centred on incorrect declaration of imports of components for the assembly of the carmaker's luxury Carnival minivan, the notice showed.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In a statement to Reuters, Kia India said it made \"a detailed response, supported by comprehensive evidence and documentation to substantiate\" its stand and the authorities were still reviewing the matter.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Kia India is committed to complying with all regulations and has \"consistently cooperated with\" authorities, it added.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->India's finance ministry and customs officials did not respond to Reuters queries.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In its 432-page notice, the government said tax authorities found Kia's Carnival \"car model was being imported in parts or components in separate lots\" via different ports, with the \"intent to discharge lesser customs duty\".<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Kia devised the strategy to ensure the imports \"could not (be) detected by customs,\" it added in the notice, issued by a customs commissioner in the southern city of Chennai.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p

executives \"changed their stance and have made efforts to mislead,\" the tax notice stated, referring to statements on imports, manufacturing and taxation.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p

Contracts on the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.4%. The Stoxx Europe 600 was little changed, with declines for technology shares offsetting gains in health care after upbeat guidance from the region’s biggest listed company, Novo Nordisk A/S.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The yen gained against the greenback and gold rose to a record high on haven demand. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped and an index of dollar strength extended losses, after US job openings fell in December by more than forecast to a three-month low.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->While the first volleys in the latest US-China trade war made clear that Xi Jinping is taking a more cautious approach than during Donald Trump’s first term, tariff risks remain at the forefront. Disappointing results from Alphabet and AMD also heightened unease about the outlook for megacap tech companies that have driven the S&amp;P 500’s gains. Amazon.com Inc. is scheduled to report on Thursday.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“It remains tough for anyone to have a particularly high degree of conviction when operating in such an uncertain environment,” said Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone Group Ltd. “I still favor adopting a more cautious stance in the short run, as uncertainty remains elevated, and participants chew through this week’s remaining risk events, including earnings from Amazon, and Friday’s US jobs report.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Alphabet posted fourth-quarter revenue that missed analysts’ expectations after growth in its cloud business slowed, raising concern from investors about the billions the company is spending on artificial intelligence. Chip maker AMD gave a disappointing outlook for its data center business, an area where it’s struggling to catch up with AI computing leader Nvidia Corp.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“Investors are expecting 9% to 22% per annum growth in earnings for the Mag-7 for the next five years, so the expectations bar is high, and any disappointment in earnings are likely to be met with a sharp selloff,” said Jim Reid, head of European and US credit strategy at at Deutsche Bank AG.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <div class=\"readmore yf-103i3cu\"><button aria-label=\"Story Continues\" class=\"secondary-btn fin-size-large readmore-button rounded yf-15mk0m\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;itc:1;sec:content-canvas;slk:Story%20Continues\" title=\"Story Continues\"> <span>Story Continues</span> </button> </div> <div class=\"read-more-wrapper\" data-testid=\"read-more\" style=\"display: none\"> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Traders are turning to the US ISM services data later today for more clues on the Federal Reserve’s rate path.

While it’s not clear what prompted the move, it comes after Trump revoked a “de minimis” rule for China, which previously allowed small packages under $800 to enter the US duty-free.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“Trade relations between the US and China remain a risk, though if the 10% US tariff and China’s response measures were to be postponed, it will
