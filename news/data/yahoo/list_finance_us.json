It came under greater scrutiny in recent years due to the rapidly growing number of low-cost items coming into the U.S. from China, mainly from prominent China-founded online retailers such as Shein, Temu and Alibaba’s AliExpress.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Former President Joe Biden’s administration proposed a crackdown on the loophole in September, but the rules did not take effect before Biden left office.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Shein and Temu have gained global popularity by offering a quickly updated assortment of ultra-inexpensive clothes, accessories, gifts and gadgets shipped mostly from China, allowing the two e-commerce companies to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:compete on the home turf;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/shein-temu-holiday-shopping-discounts-2d551895e123dedd49fa35ec58d07634\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">compete on the home turf</a> of American companies.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Seattle-based Amazon is trying to compete with them through an online storefront that mimics their business model by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:offering cheap products;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/amazon-temu-shein-discount-store-336a6c7c0b31d601f4460946fc8a6f61\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">offering cheap products</a> shipped directly from China.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Chinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to report released last week by the Congressional Research Service. In the U.S., Temu and Shein comprise about 17% of the discount market for fast fashion, toys and other consumer goods, the report said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->How much will prices go up?<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->It’s unclear. Under de minimis, Shein, Temu and AliExpress could bypass taxes collected by customs authorities. But under the changes effective Tuesday, company shipments from China will now be subject to existing duties plus the new 10% tariff imposed by Trump, analysts said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“The vast majority of these orders are valued less than $800, which means all or virtually all of them are going to get caught in that,” Youssef Squali, an analyst at Truist Financial, said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, said he thinks the price increases on platforms like Shein and Temu will be “pretty small” and the products they sell will remain cheap. However, the rule change is likely to result in delivery delays since the packages now have to go through customs, Kaziukenas said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The new tariffs will also hit third-party sellers on Amazon that import products from China, according to Squali. He expects sellers to eat some of the costs and pass the rest onto customers, which he thinks could result in percentage price increases in the mid-single digits. Other e-commerce sites that host businesses, such as Etsy, are also going to be impacted, Squali said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Temu, which is owned by China’s PDD Holdings, has previously said its growth did not depend on the de minimis policy. Though most of its products are shipped from China, Temu has been recruiting Chinese merchants to store inventory in the U.S., a move that experts said would allow it to not be as exposed to changes around the trade rule.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In January, China also introduced measures to help cross-border e-commerce build overseas warehousing by offering them tax rebates or tax exemptions<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->What are US retailers saying?<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The day after November's U.S. presidential election, Brieane Olson, CEO of teen clothing chain PacSun, went to Hong Kong to meet with factory executives to figure out ways to prepare for Trump’s tariff plan.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Roughly 35% to 40% of PacSun’s garments are made in China, even as the chain has accelerated moves to diversify with suppliers in countries like Cambodia and Vietnam.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But Olson said Trump's 10% tariff on Chinese goods was less extreme than the company anticipated. For now, PacSun doesn’t plan to increase prices on its products or move its manufacturing of knitwear and denim out of China.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Toys are another category of consumer products that relies heavily on imports from China. Greg Ahearn, the president and CEO of The Toy Association trade group, said he thinks toy companies that source in China are going to absorb the cost of the new tariff in the short term.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Eventually, those price hikes will be moved onto the consumer, Ahearn said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->___<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Associated Press writers Anne D’Innocenzio in New York, and Christopher Rugaber and Didi Tang in Washington contributed to this report.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></div>  </div>",

However, Trump pushed ahead with a 10% tariff on all Chinese merchandise.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->As part of that move, the White House also announced that it would close the century-old de minimis exemption, which allows packages worth under $800 to be shipped into the country duty-free.

It’s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Kimball Electronics was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 4.4% was weak for an industrials business. This result isn’t too surprising given its low gross margin as a starting point.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Looking at the trend in its profitability, Kimball Electronics’s operating margin might have seen some fluctuations but has generally stayed the same over the last five years, which doesn’t help its cause.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <figure class=\"yf-8xybrv\"><div class=\"image-container yf-g633g8 loader\" style=\"--max-height: 540px;\"> <div class=\"image-wrapper yf-g633g8\" style=\"--aspect-ratio: 960 / 540; --img-max-width: 960px;\"><img alt=\"Kimball Electronics Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP)\" class=\"yf-g633g8 loader\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///ywAAAAAAQABAAACAUwAOw==\" width=\"960\"/></div></div> <figcaption class=\"yf-8xybrv\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Kimball Electronics Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP)<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In Q4, Kimball Electronics generated an operating profit margin of 2.3%, down 1.8 percentage points year on year. Since Kimball Electronics’s operating margin decreased more than its gross margin, we can assume it was recently less efficient because expenses such as marketing, R&amp;D, and administrative overhead increased.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <h2 class=\"header-scroll yf-gn6wdt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Earnings Per Share<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h2> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Kimball Electronics’s full-year EPS dropped 49.2%, or 10.5% annually, over the last four years. We tend to steer our readers away from companies with falling revenue and EPS, where diminishing earnings could imply changing secular trends and preferences. If the tide turns unexpectedly, Kimball Electronics’s low margin of safety could leave its stock price susceptible to large downswings.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <figure class=\"yf-8xybrv\"><div class=\"image-container yf-g633g8 loader\" style=\"--max-height: 540px;\"> <div class=\"image-wrapper yf-g633g8\" style=\"--aspect-ratio: 960 / 540; --img-max-width: 960px;\"><img alt=\"Kimball Electronics Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP)\" class=\"yf-g633g8 loader\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///ywAAAAAAQABAAACAUwAOw==\" width=\"960\"/></div></div> <figcaption class=\"yf-8xybrv\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Kimball Electronics Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP)<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Sadly for Kimball Electronics, its EPS declined by 18.1% annually over the last two years while its revenue was flat. This tells us the company struggled to adjust to choppy demand.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We can take a deeper look into Kimball Electronics’s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. Kimball Electronics’s operating margin has declined by 2 percentage points over the last two years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its lower earnings; taxes and interest expenses can also affect EPS but don’t tell us as much about a company’s fundamentals.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In Q4, Kimball Electronics reported EPS at $0.29, down from $0.33 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print easily cleared analysts’ estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Kimball Electronics’s full-year EPS of $1.18 to grow 32.6%.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <h2 class=\"header-scroll yf-gn6wdt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Key Takeaways from Kimball Electronics’s Q4 Results<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h2> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Kimball Electronics's revenue in the quarter missed. Adding to the bad news was the company's lowering of its full-year revenue and operating margin guidance, which fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this was a softer quarter. The stock traded down 4.5% to $17.06 immediately after reporting.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The latest quarter from Kimball Electronics’s wasn’t that good. One earnings report doesn’t define a company’s quality, though, so let’s explore whether the stock is a buy at the current price. We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy. <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it’s free;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://stockstory.org/stocks/nasdaq/ke?utm_source=earningsArticle&amp;utm_medium=yahoo&amp;utm_campaign=end1&amp;utm_article=Dlh2b24PYQ%3D%3D&amp;utm_ticker=KE\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it’s free</a>.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></div>  </div>",
