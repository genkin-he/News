It’s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Hubbell has been a well-oiled machine over the last five years. It demonstrated elite profitability for an industrials business, boasting an average operating margin of 16.2%.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Looking at the trend in its profitability, Hubbell’s operating margin rose by 6 percentage points over the last five years, showing its efficiency has meaningfully improved.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <figure class=\"yf-8xybrv\"><div class=\"image-container yf-g633g8 loader\" style=\"--max-height: 540px;\"> <div class=\"image-wrapper yf-g633g8\" style=\"--aspect-ratio: 960 / 540; --img-max-width: 960px;\"><img alt=\"Hubbell Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP)\" class=\"yf-g633g8 loader\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///ywAAAAAAQABAAACAUwAOw==\" width=\"960\"/></div></div> <figcaption class=\"yf-8xybrv\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Hubbell Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP)<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->This quarter, Hubbell generated an operating profit margin of 19.3%, up 2.6 percentage points year on year. The increase was encouraging, and since its operating margin rose more than its gross margin, we can infer it was recently more efficient with expenses such as marketing, R&amp;D, and administrative overhead.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <h2 class=\"header-scroll yf-gn6wdt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Earnings Per Share<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h2> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Revenue trends explain a company’s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth – for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Hubbell’s EPS grew at a spectacular 15.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 4.2% annualized revenue growth.

As we mentioned earlier, Hubbell’s operating margin expanded by 6 percentage points over the last five years. On top of that, its share count shrank by 1.3%. These are positive signs for shareholders because improving profitability and share buybacks turbocharge EPS growth relative to revenue growth.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <figure class=\"yf-8xybrv\"><div class=\"image-container yf-g633g8 loader\" style=\"--max-height: 540px;\"> <div class=\"image-wrapper yf-g633g8\" style=\"--aspect-ratio: 960 / 540; --img-max-width: 960px;\"><img alt=\"Hubbell Diluted Shares Outstanding\" class=\"yf-g633g8 loader\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///ywAAAAAAQABAAACAUwAOw==\" width=\"960\"/></div></div> <figcaption class=\"yf-8xybrv\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Hubbell Diluted Shares Outstanding<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a shorter period to see if we are missing a change in the business.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->For Hubbell, its two-year annual EPS growth of 24.9% was higher than its five-year trend. We love it when earnings growth accelerates, especially when it accelerates off an already high base.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In Q4, Hubbell reported EPS at $4.10, up from $3.69 in the same quarter last year. This print beat analysts’ estimates by 2.1%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Hubbell’s full-year EPS of $16.56 to grow 7%.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <h2 class=\"header-scroll yf-gn6wdt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Key Takeaways from Hubbell’s Q4 Results<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h2> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We struggled to find many resounding positives in these results. Its revenue missed significantly and its organic revenue fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this was a weaker quarter. The stock traded down 1.6% to $401.70 immediately following the results.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Hubbell may have had a tough quarter, but does that actually create an opportunity to invest right now?
