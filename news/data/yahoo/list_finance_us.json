Ahead of the second term, however, he told the New York Post that he \"always liked the visas,\" which US companies use to hire foreign workers with specialized skills, often in science and technology.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->\"I've been a believer in H-1B,\" he told The Post in December. \"I have used it many times. It's a great program.\"<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Still, the future of the program remains very much up in the air: Last week two Republican senators <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:introduced a joint resolution;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2025/1/kennedy-leads-resolution-to-reverse-biden-dhs-rule-automatically-extending-immigrant-work-permits\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">introduced a joint resolution</a> to strike down a Biden-era rule allowing such visas to be automatically extended for 540 days, instead of 180 days.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->As such, Business Insider has run the numbers to find out which US financial services companies stand to be most impacted if these visas are tamped down again. BI used data from the Department of Labor and US Citizenship and Immigration data to analyze which financial giants file the most H-1B requests. The data runs through the 2024 government fiscal year (the fourth quarter of 2023 through the third quarter of 2024) and is collected from applications submitted by businesses that wish to sponsor a skilled worker's visa.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We found that some of the largest banks, credit card companies, and asset managers are among the most active sponsors of these visas, including JPMorgan and BlackRock. While many of the filings seek tech and software workers, some firms have used them to hire investment bankers or investment professionals.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Of course, not all filings lead to a foreign-worker hire and some filings may actually be for the same hire as firms will refile to reflect amendments or to extend an existing visa.

The abrupt about-face saw a gauge of the dollar retreat from the highest level in more than two years, making the precious metal cheaper for most buyers.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->There’s still plenty of uneasiness in markets about what lies ahead, burnishing gold’s appeal as a store of value in a hard-to-predict environment. Washington is set to impose a 10% tariff against Chinese imports from Tuesday in the US, although Trump said he would speak to Beijing regarding the proposed duties.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Among the biggest questions are how resilient the US economy would be to a trade war — if it materializes — as well as the ripple-on effects for monetary policy if tariffs reignite inflation. The Federal Reserve paused rate cuts last month, adopting a “wait-and-see” approach with regards to the new administration’s policies.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Spot gold rose 0.3% to $2,822.44 an ounce as of 11:26 a.m. in Singapore.

Silver was steady, while platinum and palladium advanced.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Trade war fears had jolted precious metals markets even before the shenanigans over the last few days. US prices of gold and silver have surged above international benchmarks in recent weeks, causing dealers and traders to rush huge volumes of the metals into the US before any tariffs are imposed. The chaos has also led to a spike in lease rates for gold and silver — the return that holders of bullion in London’s vaults can get by loaning metal out on a short-term basis.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <ul class=\"yf-1woyvo2\"><li class=\"yf-1woyvo2\"> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Elon Musk Inside the Treasury Department Payment System;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-02/elon-musk-gets-inside-treasury-department-payment-system?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Elon Musk Inside the Treasury Department Payment System</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </li><li class=\"yf-1woyvo2\"> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:The Internet Almost Killed Barnes &amp; Noble, Then Saved It;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-30/barnes-noble-sales-are-growing-again-thanks-to-booktok-buzz?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Internet Almost Killed Barnes &amp; Noble, Then Saved It</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </li><li class=\"yf-1woyvo2\"> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Indy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-01-29/indy-pass-the-alternative-to-vail-seasonal-ski-ticket-is-gaining-fans?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Indy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </li><li class=\"yf-1woyvo2\"> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:What America’s Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-01-27/what-tech-billionaires-want-from-trump-s-presidency?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">What America’s Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </li><li class=\"yf-1woyvo2\"> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-28/podcast-musk-pitches-new-narrative-as-tesla-sales-fall?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->©2025 Bloomberg L.P.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  </div>",

The onshore markets will reopen on Wednesday following the Chinese New Year break.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later told Fox News there’s a plan for Trump to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping about “illegal Chinese fentanyl that is killing tens of thousands of Americans every single year.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“The president has made it very clear to China that we are not going to tolerate that,” she said. “And I would also add that many of President Trump’s tariffs from the first term are still in effect.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The focus has turned to the world’s No. 2 economy after Trump reached last-minute agreements with Mexico and Canada to delay 25% tariffs in return for tougher measures against migration and drug trafficking at the border. For Beijing, a deal for splitting ownership of China-owned app TikTok would likely also be on the agenda of any leaders’ call.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“GREAT INTEREST IN TIKTOK!” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday morning. “Would be wonderful for China, and all concerned.” The Republican has given ByteDance Ltd.’s social media app, which has been flagged as a national security threat, 75 days to find a partner in the US to keep operating in the country.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->China Playbook<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->China’s reaction to Trump’s initial tariff announcement — coming in the middle of a weeklong Lunar New Year holiday — was relatively muted. The Commerce Ministry issued a statement expressing strong “dissatisfaction” and vowed unspecified “corresponding countermeasures,” while saying China would file a complaint at the World Trade Organization.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <div class=\"readmore yf-103i3cu\"><button aria-label=\"Story Continues\" class=\"secondary-btn fin-size-large readmore-button rounded yf-15mk0m\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;itc:1;sec:content-canvas;slk:Story%20Continues\" title=\"Story Continues\"> <span>Story Continues</span> </button> </div> <div class=\"read-more-wrapper\" data-testid=\"read-more\" style=\"display: none\"> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->That wasn’t unusual. During the first trade war, Beijing typically retaliated only after tariffs became law. But it may not follow the same playbook this time around given the economy is in worse shape and it exports fewer products directly to the US.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->China also has more tools at its disposal if it chooses to hit back. A series of laws passed since Trump’s first term, for example, give Beijing greater sway over domestic business deals in the name of national security.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Trump’s weekend order called on China to leverage its vast surveillance network to stop criminal organizations facilitating the flow of illicit drugs. Exactly what that would entail wasn’t specified, giving Xi no obvious path to avoiding the tariffs — especially since Beijing has already pledged to crack down on domestic chemical companies involved in the deadly synthetic opioid.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Trump and Xi last spoke before the US president’s second inauguration, in a call in which they discussed trade, fentanyl and TikTok.
