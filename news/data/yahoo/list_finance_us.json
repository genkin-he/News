Additionally, there has been an increasing focus on emissions and water conservation over the last decade, driving innovation in the sector and demand for new services. On the other hand, air and water services companies are at the whim of economic cycles.

On the other hand, its full-year EPS guidance missed and its EPS guidance for next quarter fell slightly short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this quarter was mixed.
