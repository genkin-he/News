Food is quickly becoming more expensive and service prices are proving resistant to higher borrowing costs. Complicating matters further, domestic demand is getting a boost from low unemployment and persistent government spending.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Short-term inflation is “adverse” on factors including higher meat prices and industrial goods costs that are under pressure from a depreciated real, they wrote.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->What Bloomberg Economics Says<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The Brazilian central bank’s hawkish meeting minutes signaled policymakers remain wary of the inflation outlook and won’t shy away from further tightening if necessary. Recent changes to the board and a shift in downside inflation risks at the January gathering raised concerns of a more dovish tilt, so this commitment will be in sharp focus — stopping hikes before a material improvement in inflation expectations could dent the BCB’s credibility.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->— Adriana Dupita, Brazil and Argentina economist<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->— Click here for full report<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Back in December, central bankers said a more difficult economic outlook would force them to hike borrowing costs to 14.25% by March.

After his economic team’s latest plan to shore up public coffers was watered down by Congress last year, the leftist leader said there would be no additional austerity plans, if it were up to him.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In that scenario, central bankers highlighted the need for “harmonious” fiscal and monetary policies. They also warned about the impacts of a rise in subsidized credit and “uncertainties” over the country’s debt path, which sparked a sell-off late last year that weakened the real over 20%.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Trade Woes<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Global financial conditions are tightening while trade policies remain uncertain, central bankers wrote.

It’s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Hubbell has been a well-oiled machine over the last five years. It demonstrated elite profitability for an industrials business, boasting an average operating margin of 16.2%.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Looking at the trend in its profitability, Hubbell’s operating margin rose by 6 percentage points over the last five years, showing its efficiency has meaningfully improved.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <figure class=\"yf-8xybrv\"><div class=\"image-container yf-g633g8 loader\" style=\"--max-height: 540px;\"> <div class=\"image-wrapper yf-g633g8\" style=\"--aspect-ratio: 960 / 540; --img-max-width: 960px;\"><img alt=\"Hubbell Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP)\" class=\"yf-g633g8 loader\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///ywAAAAAAQABAAACAUwAOw==\" width=\"960\"/></div></div> <figcaption class=\"yf-8xybrv\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Hubbell Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP)<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->This quarter, Hubbell generated an operating profit margin of 19.3%, up 2.6 percentage points year on year.

As we mentioned earlier, TransDigm’s operating margin expanded by 13.9 percentage points over the last five years.

The company reaffirmed its full-year revenue guidance and slightly raised its EPS guidance, although even this new outlook came in below expectations. Overall, this was a mixed quarter. The stock traded down 1.3% to $1,337 immediately after reporting.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->TransDigm underperformed this quarter, but does that create an opportunity to invest right now?
