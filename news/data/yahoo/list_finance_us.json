Cloud revenue grew 30% — decelerating from +35% in 3Q — and Google noted that it is capacity constrained as demand outstrips supply, in theory a good problem to have. In terms of costs &amp; margins, 4Q operating income margin of 32.1% was a bit light, but still reflected 465bps of year over year margin expansion (+325bps excl. 1x items). The bigger question is whether Google can continue to expand margins in 2025 given likely slower revenue growth and accelerating depreciation.
