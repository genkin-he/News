The precision instruments business, which provides data and insights to a wide range of firms, has posted a 0.4pc decline and underperformed the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:FTSE 250 index;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/do-not-give-up-uk-stock-market-ftse/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FTSE 250 index</a>, of which it is a member, by 13 percentage points.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Of course, the company has experienced a rather chequered operating environment of late. For example, its third-quarter <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:trading statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/how-start-trading-guide-beginners/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">trading statement</a>, which was released in October, showed that the recovery anticipated at the time of its half-year results in July had not materialised as quickly as expected. This caused like-for-like sales to decline by 10pc during the quarter, with challenges in key markets such as China a significant contributor.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->However, this disappointing announcement was followed by a substantially more upbeat full-year trading update last month. It revealed the company now expects profits for the 2024 financial year to be at the upper end of market expectations following a strong performance in the final quarter of the year.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->While this is undoubtedly encouraging, some investors may feel the company’s recent up-and-down performance represents a red flag. After all, it is unlikely to be conducive to a sustained rise in its share price given that an increasingly wide margin of safety may now be demanded by prospective buyers in return for seemingly volatile financial prospects.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->However, Questor remains firmly upbeat regarding the stock’s long-term investment potential – it is still a high-quality business with a bright future. For instance, it has a solid financial position that suggests it is well placed to overcome the inherent unpredictability of its trading environment. This is evidenced by a net cash position of £231m at the time of its half-year results in June.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->A strong balance sheet means the firm is capable of engaging in M&amp;A activity to bolster its long-term prospects. Indeed, it completed several acquisitions during the 2024 financial year and could realistically continue this trend. It is also in the midst of a £150m share buyback programme that, in this column’s view, is a sensible move given the stock’s recent underperformance vis-à-vis the wider index and its relatively attractive valuation.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->It currently trades on a forward <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:price-to-earnings ratio;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/stocks-shares/price-to-earnings-ratio/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">price-to-earnings ratio </a>using expected earnings for 2024 of around 19. Although this is substantially higher than the ratings of many mid-cap shares at present, the company’s bottom line is forecast to rise at a double-digit rate in 2025. This suggests it offers good value for money compared with its cheaper, but slower-growing, index peers.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <div class=\"readmore yf-103i3cu\"><button aria-label=\"Story Continues\" class=\"secondary-btn fin-size-large readmore-button rounded yf-15mk0m\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;itc:1;sec:content-canvas;slk:Story%20Continues\" title=\"Story Continues\"> <span>Story Continues</span> </button> </div> <div class=\"read-more-wrapper\" data-testid=\"read-more\" style=\"display: none\"> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Many of the company’s key markets, meanwhile, are set to experience strong economic growth as interest rate cuts gradually have their desired effect on activity levels. The US, for instance, accounted for 26pc of the company’s sales in the first half of the year. Its buoyant outlook should boost demand for the firm’s range of products that equates to an increasingly upbeat financial performance.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Spectris is also worthy of its current valuation as a result of its solid competitive position. In the 2023 financial year, for example, its return on equity was 11pc in spite of it utilising very limited leverage. This suggests it is well placed to capitalise on an improving industry outlook, with the company’s cost-cutting strategy having the potential to further enhance its market position. Indeed, its third-quarter trading update stated that the business’s restructuring programme is expected to ultimately reduce annual costs by £50m.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Of course, even the most formidable strategy cannot reasonably be expected to smooth out highly changeable short-term operating conditions. Therefore, Questor would be wholly unsurprised if the company’s share price continues to exhibit elevated volatility over the coming months. It may also be negatively affected by uncertainty regarding China’s economic performance and ongoing geopolitical risks that could prompt weaker investor sentiment towards cyclical companies.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->However, Spectris remains a high-quality business that is well-positioned to overcome <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:near-term challenges;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/what-is-diversification-and-why-important/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">near-term challenges</a> to produce a much improved share price performance.

Local brokerage JM Financial Ltd. expects the benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index’s earnings to grow less than 5% this fiscal year, the slowest pace since the pandemic. Some strategists say even that forecast may be too optimistic.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->To make matters worse, the global backdrop is becoming more challenging as US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies spur uncertainty and raise the odds of further dollar strengthening. Some strategists are skeptical that the record $11.5 billion in tax cuts announced by Modi’s government last week will be enough to counter these headwinds and help earnings recover.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“There is room for downward revisions as we don’t think there is going to be a V-shaped recovery in earnings,” Rajat Agarwal, an Asia strategist at Societe Generale Pvt., said by phone. “Tax cuts are not a big positive for the earnings recovery, as consumption has a lower multiplier effect on the economy than capex.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->At the heart of the issue is India’s economic slowdown. The global growth champion is stumbling after a pandemic-era consumption boom slowed and inflation spiked. The government has lowered its growth projection for the fiscal year to the weakest since the pandemic.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->JM Financial expects profits for the three months ended December to be up just 4.4% year-on-year, making it a third straight quarter of single-digit growth. Out of the 39 Nifty 50 companies that have posted results so far, earnings for 19 have missed estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg show.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->And markets are punishing weak results. Tata Motors, the Indian parent of luxury sport utility vehicles Jaguar Land Rover, saw its shares plunge more than 7% after it reported a 22% drop in net income, missing expectations. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., the biggest carmaker, also saw its stock drop after profit missed estimates, hurt by higher input costs mainly due to the rupee’s slide against the US dollar.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <div class=\"readmore yf-103i3cu\"><button aria-label=\"Story Continues\" class=\"secondary-btn fin-size-large readmore-button rounded yf-15mk0m\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;itc:1;sec:content-canvas;slk:Story%20Continues\" title=\"Story Continues\"> <span>Story Continues</span> </button> </div> <div class=\"read-more-wrapper\" data-testid=\"read-more\" style=\"display: none\"> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Shares of Adani Enterprises, the flagship firm of the ports-to-power Adani conglomerate, dropped more than 5% intraday on Jan. 30 after it reported a 97% plunge in quarterly profit, weighed down by its coal trading unit and a foreign-exchange loss.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The dismal earnings picture comes at a difficult time for Indian stocks, which are struggling to find catalysts to stem a selloff that has erased over $600 billion from the market value of companies on the MSCI India Index since a peak in late September.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Global funds have pulled more $20 billion on a net basis during this period. They were sellers for 22 straight days through on Feb. 3, making it a record streak for daily withdrawals in data compiled by Bloomberg.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->India’s equity downturn comes after a yearslong rally that saw the Nifty 50 gauge cap a ninth straight annual gain in 2024, making the market a favorite among global investors.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The momentum faltered after Modi’s party shifted its focus toward welfare projects after an unexpected loss of its parliamentary majority in June. The pivot has slowed investment-driven growth, the key driver behind the market’s over 200% surge since the pandemic, and put pressure on corporate profits.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->There are expectations that as the positive impact of tax cuts flows through the economy, consumer firms — which account for about 18% of the main index — will support profitability. JM Financial estimates that Nifty 50 earnings can rebound to 18% in the next fiscal year, driven by greater urban spending, recovery in rural demand and the ongoing expenditure on infrastructure.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->For now though, corporates remain concerned about weak demand. Mentions of the word “slowdown” in earnings calls of companies in the Nifty 500 — the broadest gauge in India — hit the highest level since the pandemic, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“Consumption is returning as key investment theme but it would be too early to say it alone can revive earnings growth,” said Mohit Khanna, a fund manager at Purnartha Investment Advisers Pvt.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) lost 9 cents, or 0.12%, to $72.61.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Oil on Tuesday traded in a wide range, with WTI falling at one point by 3%, its lowest since Dec. 31, after China announced tariffs on U.S. imports of oil, liquefied natural gas and coal in retaliation to U.S. levies on Chinese exports.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Prices rebounded, however, after Trump restored the \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Iran to curtail its nuclear programme he enacted in his first term that cut Iranian crude exports to zero.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The impact of China's retaliatory tariffs on energy prices will be limited \"given that neither global supply nor demand of these commodities are changed by China's tariffs,\" analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a note on Tuesday.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Both countries will be able to find alternative markets, the note said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->While Trump said he was open to a deal with Iran and expressed a willingness to talk to the Iranian leader when he signed the presidential memorandum re-imposing Washington's tough policy on Iran, the plan could impact about 1.5 million barrels per day of oil that the country exports, analysts at ANZ said on Wednesday, citing shiptracking data.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Prices were also pressured by rising crude and fuel stockpiles in the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Crude stocks rose by 5.03 million barrels in the week ended Jan. 31, according to market sources, citing American Petroleum Institute figures.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Gasoline inventories rose by 5.43 million barrels, and distillate stocks fell by 6.98 million barrels, the API reported, according to the sources.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Official U.S. government oil inventory data is due to be released on Wednesday.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p class=\"yf-1pe5jgt\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->(Reporting by Laila Kearney; Editing by Christian Schmollinger)<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  </div>",
