The BJP last secured a majority in the Delhi Assembly in 1993. Delhi did not have an Assembly between 1956 to 1993.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe polling for the Delhi Assembly concluded on Wednesday evening, with a 58 per cent voter turnout, subject to revision, till the reports had come in. The voter turnout in the 2020 Assembly polls was 62.55 per cent and 67.12 per cent, both of which were marked by an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) sweep.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOnly two exit polls, Mind Brink and Wee Preside, predicted a victory for the AAP. The rest, including People’s Insight, Matrize, PMarq and Chanakya Strategies, said the BJP-led NDA was on course not just to better its  2013 performance, which was its best since 1993, but secure a majority. The BJP contested 68 of the 70 seats, while one each was contested by its allies, the Janata Dal (United) and Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAmong the exit polls that predicted a BJP victory, the People's Pulse showed the party was likely to get 51 to 60 seats, while the AAP may get 10-19 seats. According to People's Insight exit poll, the NDA is likely to get 40 to 44 seats, the AAP 25 to 29 seats, and the Congress 0-1 seat.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe P-Marq exit poll predicted 39-49 seats for the BJP and its allies, 21-31 seats for AAP and 0-1 for the Congress.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe JVC exit poll said the BJP and allies would get 39-45, the AAP 22-31 seats and the Congress 0-2.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSimilarly, the Poll Diary predicted 42-50 seats of the BJP and allies, while giving the AAP 18-25 seats, 0-2 for the Congress and 0-1 for others.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tChanakya Strategies exit poll said the BJP and allies are likely to get 39-44 seats, the AAP is likely to get 25-28, while Congress may get 2-3.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTwo surveys predicted AAP's victory - Wee Preside, which gave 46-52 seats for AAP, 18-23 for BJP and 0-1 for Congress, and Mind Brink Media predicted 44-49 seats for AAP, 21-25 for BJP and 0-1 for the Congress.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMatrize exit poll predicted a close contest, giving the BJP led NDA 35-40 seats, while the AAP was said to get 32 to 37 seats. The survey gave Congress 0-1 seats.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe DV Research exit polls predicted 26-34 seats for the AAP, and 36-44 for the BJP and allies, giving zero seats to the Congress.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn the 70 member Delhi assembly, 36 is the majority mark. The AAP currently has 62 MLAs, the BJP has eight, and the Congress none.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn 1993, the BJP won 49 of the 70 seats. It failed to cross the 25 seat mark in all subsequent elections barring 2013. In 2013, which resulted in a hung assembly, the BJP fell short of the majority mark but emerged the single largest party with 31 seats. The BJP’s vote share over the last decade in the Delhi Assembly polls has increased from 33.07 per cent in 2013 to 38.51 per cent in 2020. However, AAP secured a vote share of 54.34 per cent and 53.57 per cent in 2015 and 2020, respectively. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tExit polls predicted a couple of seats for the Congress, suggesting that its vote share could increase in this round of the Assembly polls. The Congress secured a poor vote share of 4.26 per cent in the 2020 Assembly polls, failing to win any seats.</div></div>",

The parks-led Experiences group also incurred about $75 million in expenses associated with the December launch of the Disney Treasure cruise ship.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tDisney reported a 44 per cent jump in adjusted per-share earnings of $1.76 for the October-December quarter, exceeding the $1.45 per-share earnings consensus estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by LSEG.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tRevenue for the fiscal first quarter rose 5 per cent to $24.69 billion, slightly ahead of analysts' projections of $24.62 billion. Operating income rose 31 per cent from a year earlier to $5.1 billion.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tShares fell more than 1 per cent in early trading, as investors appeared to react to Disney's guidance that its flagship Disney+ streaming service would shed a modest number of subscribers in the coming quarter following its recent price increase. That stands in sharp contrast to rival Netflix's record gains of 19 million subscribers.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<div>\r\n\t\"Clearly, Netflix won last quarter's battle in the overall streaming war,\" said Forrester research director Mike Proulx. \"While Disneyâ€™s (streaming) business posted a modest revenue increase, it was largely driven by price hikes. Price pinching consumers isnâ€™t a long-term growth strategy.\" Disney forecast \"high single digit\" adjusted earnings-per-share growth in fiscal 2025 compared with 2024, and an increase of approximately $875 million in operating income at the streaming entertainment unit.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe company also said it would incur $50 million in costs associated with exiting its Venu Sports joint venture with Warner Bros Discovery and Fox. The media companies abandoned their plans for a sports streaming service in January, after it ran into substantial legal opposition.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tOperating income at Disney's Entertainment unit, which includes film, television and streaming, increased to $1.7 billion, nearly double the results from a year earlier, thanks in part to the strong performance of \"Moana 2.\" The animated sequel topped $1 billion in box office in January, becoming the fourth Walt Disney Animation film to reach that milestone.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\t\"Disney has turned in the fairytale performance investors had been hoping for ... It shows that Disney is still a powerful force to be reckoned with when it comes to delivering blockbuster hits,\" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\n<strong>TELEVISION BUSINESS</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tDisney's traditional television business continued to erode.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tOperating income at so-called linear networks fell 11 per cent to $1.1 billion. Iger called the company's venerable TV networks \"an asset\" that enhances its overall television business, including streaming.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t\"While I won't rule out the possibility some of the smaller networks, in some form or another, being configured differently in terms of how we bring them to market, maybe even ownership,\" said Iger. \"But right now, we actually feel good about the hand that we have.\"<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe remarks come as Comcast prepares to spin off its some cable networks into a separately traded company.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tSubscribers for the flagship streaming video service, Disney+, slipped 1 per cent from the prior quarter to 124.6 million. The company had warned of a modest drop because of a price increase that took effect in October. It also forecast a modest decline in Disney+ subscribers in the second quarter compared to the first.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tDisney+ and Hulu produced an operating profit of $293 million, marking the third straight quarter of profitability and a turnaround from the year-ago loss of $138 million.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tDisney said its addition of ESPN to Disney+ has encouraged subscribers to sample sports programming, increasing time spent on the app, a trend it hopes to capitalize on with the addition of a daily \"SportsCenter\" studio show called \"SC+\" this year. All of this sets the stage for the launch of its flagship ESPN offering within the app this fall.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIn the Experiences segment, which includes consumer products and the cruise line, as well as parks, operating income was roughly flat at $3.1 billion. Profit declined 5 per cent at domestic parks because the hurricanes and cruise ship costs, while operating income at international parks rose 28 per cent from a year ago.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t\"Parks has always been Disney's ace-in-the-hole, a massively profitable division that helped to subsidize the immense cost required to prop up a cash-burning streaming operation,\" said Brandon Katz, senior entertainment industry strategist at Parrot Analytics.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t\"It's concerning that Parks has now reported softer-than-expected results in back-to-back quarters.\" At the Sports unit, which includes the ESPN network and Star India business, operating income was $247 million, compared with a year-ago loss, in part reflecting improvement in Star India's operating results ahead of Disney and Reliance Industries completing a deal to combine their Indian media assets.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIger appeared to reference rival Netflix's entry into live sports during the investor call, and its Jake Paul-Mike Tyson boxing match and its Christmas Day NFL games, saying ESPN provides sports fans with programming \"365 days a year, 24 hours a day.\"<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t\"So if you're a sports fan, it's not about one day of one boxing event or one day of football,\" said Iger. \"It's about sports every single day of the year and every hour of the day.
