The fiscal deficit for FY'25 has been pegged lower at 4.8 per cent of GDP, lower than budgeted 4.9 per cent, while for FY'26 the deficit is projected to be 4.4 per cent, lower than what was given in the consolidation roadmap.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\t\"It is very important to be very clear that we (government) have to remain within a certain fiscal regime. We have, to that extent, aided the monetary authorities to say that if they (RBI) have to do what they have to do, we are supportive. The fiscal policy and monetary policy need to work in tandem not at cross purposes,\" Pandey said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Secretary said the economy would reap a lot more benefits with monetary easing and keeping inflation under control.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Inflationary policies can really work only in the short-run in terms of pushing growth. If we have to have sustained growth, we need to have a good grip on inflation. That's the balancing that we need...,\" Pandey said at an Assocham post-Budget interaction.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe monetary policy committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will begin its three-day meeting on February 5. The MPC will announce its policy decisions on February 7.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTo a question on whether the Monetary Policy Committee will decide to cut policy rates, Pandey said \"I think it's a call that MPC will take. They are seized of the situation. They will take a call.\"<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tAsked if depreciating rupee could lead to a concern on the inflation front, he said: \"there are other factors that need to be taken into consideration by the RBI. Of course, the depreciation also brings to some extent imported inflation, but it also adds to export competitiveness to products\".</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tOn Monday, the rupee plunged 49 paise to close at an all-time low of 87.11 against the US dollar. The rupee recovered 3 paise to close at 87.08 (provisional) against US dollar on Tuesday, as the American currency index retreated from its elevated level after President Donald Trump agreed to pause tariffs on Mexico and Canada.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Rupee is in a free-float system, external things are working. The RBI is watching, we are watching,\" Pandey said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWith the economic growth slowing to 4-year low of 6.4 per cent in current fiscal, as per NSO data, there is a growing clamour for a cut in benchmark policy rates.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tRetail inflation in December eased to 5.22 per cent, from 5.48 per cent in November, and remained within the RBI's tolerance band of 4 per cent (+/- 2 per cent).</p>\n<p>\r\n\tRBI has held policy rates steady at 6.5 per cent since February 2023 to control inflation.</p><p></p></div>",

We have availed of duty drawbacks at the notified rates. Now, the buyer has raised some quality issues. He wants us to remit 5 per cent of the payment made or adjust 5 per cent in the value of the next shipment. Can we do so and if so, under what provisions?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPara C.22 of the RBI FED Master Direction no.16 dated 1st January 2016 (as amended) allows remittance of export claims where full payment is already realised. This provision requires surrender of proportionate export incentive.  A less messy way is to declare the full value in and allow a discount of 5% in your next shipment. That way, only the net value after deduction of the discount will flow into the EDPMS and the drawback claim will also be limited to the discounted value.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Due to some mistake at the Customs end we were paid drawback twice against the same shipment, something that we didn’t notice immediately.  Now, the Customs have discovered this mistake of double payment and asked us to surrender the drawback paid in excess, which we are quite ready to do. The trouble is they want interest from the date of payment till the date of surrender of the excess drawback. How can the Customs ask us to pay interest when the double payment was due to their fault and not ours?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSection 75A(2) of the Customs Act, 1962 says that ‘where any drawback has been paid to the claimant erroneously or it becomes otherwise recoverable under this Act or the rules made thereunder, the claimant shall, within a period of two months from the date of demand, pay in addition to the said amount of drawback, interest at the rate fixed under Section 28AA and the amount of interest shall be calculated for the period beginning from the date of payment of such drawback to the claimant till the date of recovery of such drawback’. So, you cannot avoid payment of interest @15 per cent p.a., the rate prescribed under notification no.33/2016-Cus dated 1st March 2016.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>We have sought a set-off of import payables and export receivables from our bank, who say that they cannot allow it because the imports and exports have taken place in different calendar years. We do not understand whether they are correct and how it matters whether the imports and exports took place in the same year or different years. We do not understand the way forward. Can you please guide us? </strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCondition (g) at Para C.16 of the RBI FED Master Direction no.16/2015-16 dated 1st January 2016 (as amended) says that set-off shall be allowed between the export and import legs taking place during the same calendar year. In my opinion, this condition makes no sense and should be withdrawn. I suggest that you write to RBI seeking relaxation of this condition and get it forwarded by your bankers. You should get the relaxation without any hitch.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
