Suddenly, there is gold shortage in the last one week, and gold metal loan interest rates are also fluid,\" Ajoy Chawla, CEO of Titan's Jewellery division said in an investor call.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe initial indications are that the rates on gold leasing could go up, Titan said without giving the quantum of the rise it expects to see from current 1.5 per cent-2 per cent.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"We need to wait for a month or two to understand how the supply and therefore the pricing will play out,\" said Vijay Govindarajan, the company's associate vice president - Finance.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tTitan also said it is difficult to predict fourth-quarter growth due to gold prices hitting an all-time peak amid fears of a new US-China trade war. It did not specify which metric of growth it was referring to.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe company reported third-quarter profit above estimates after market hours on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt also said it absorbed the full impact of inventory losses from the Indian government cutting gold import taxes in July 2024, which weighed on its second-quarter profit despite higher sales.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTitan already held inventory before the cut in import taxes, reducing the average value of its stock. It also had to sell the old inventory at lower market prices following the cut.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\t\"We hope that we are able to sustain some kind of growth rates that we have seen between all the quarters put together, or at least second and third-quarter,\" Chawla said, adding that customers might buy gold if prices don't fall.</p><p></p></div>",
