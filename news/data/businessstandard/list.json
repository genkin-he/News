We’re launching Krutrim 2 today as a much improved model,” said Aggarwal. The company claims that Krutrim 2 is a best-in-class LLM for Indic languages.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t“Krutrim-2 is a 12 billion parameters dense transformer model, built on the Mistral-NeMo architecture. Our team ensured that Krutrim-2 received comprehensive training on a rich dataset encompassing English, Indic languages (hundreds of billions of tokens), code snippets, mathematical concepts, literary works, and high quality synthetically generated content.

This evaluation tool is designed to assess AI models’ effectiveness in Indian languages and cultural contexts.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tWhether BharatBench will gain acceptance among other Indian AI developers remains to be seen.
