In the third quarter (Q3FY25) brokerages tracked by Business Standard expect ITC's adjusted net profit to decline 3.5 per cent in the quarter ended December 31, 2024, on average, to Rs 5,151.12 crore as compared to Rs 5,340 crore a year ago. PAT is likely to decline due to the low tax rate in the base quarter.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, on a sequential basis, the PAT is expected to rise 3.2 per cent.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn Q3, the revenue of ITC, on average, is pegged at Rs 18,395.42 crore as compared to Rs 19,484.5 crore a year ago which implies a slip of 5.5 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y). On a quarter-on-quarter (Q-o-Q) basis, the revenue is estimated to slip 3.9 per cent.

Further, the FMCG business is likely to grow 6-7 per cent revenue growth owing to urban slowdown.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBesides, Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation  (Ebitda) margin is expected to remain flat sequentially due to inflationary pressure related to the raw material index of the cigarette business and adverse business mix which is higher salience from the agriculture segment.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHDFC Securities pegged the Ebitda for Q3 at Rs 6155.7 crore as compared to Rs 6,024.3 crore a year ago.
