Kavach is the most cost-effective Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system globally.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to analysts at Elara Capital, Kavach is at the forefront given rising train accidents. Expect a sharp rise in approved vendors from three, led by low deployment (1,548rkm completed versus 68,584rkm), large order pipeline (bids for 15,000 kms in FY26; Kavach for 10,000 locos) and overall opportunity size at Rs 45,000 crore. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRail infra is another focus area, with an opportunity size of Rs 4.5 trillion from network expansion (new lines: Rs 2.6 trillion, gauge conversion: Rs 30,000 crore, doubling: Rs 1.7 trillion), as 73 per cent of the outlay is still to be spent.
