Fed Chair Jerome Powell said after the meeting that when it comes to tariffs, \"we need to let those policies be articulated before we can even begin to make a plausible assessment of what their implications for the economy will be.\"</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tCollins, who is a voting member of the Fed's rate-setting committee this year, told CNBC that Fed policy is well-positioned. She noted that \"it's really appropriate for policy to be patient, careful, and there's no urgency for making additional adjustments, especially given all of the uncertainty, even though, of course, we're still somewhat restrictive\" with the current stance of interest rates.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tBostic also signaled he was ready to stay on the sidelines for the time being. There is \"a ton of uncertainty in a ton of space,\" Bostic told a Rotary Club of Atlanta meeting, adding \"there are a lot of things I am going to wait and see about ...</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tI'd be very satisfied to wait for a while\" with rates at their current levels.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tCollins left the door open to further rate cuts, saying \"I certainly would see additional ... normalization, in terms of what the policy stance is,\" without providing a time frame.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tFinancial markets are currently betting the Fed will wait until at least June before it cuts rates again.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<em>(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</em></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
