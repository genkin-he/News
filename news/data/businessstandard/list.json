The stock of the non banking finance company (NBFC) was quoting at its highest level since September 27, 2024. A combined 8.78 million equity shares changed hands on the NSE and BSE till 01:55 PM.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn the past three weeks, it has surged 20 per cent. In the past one month, Manappuram Finance has outperformed the market by surging 15 per cent, as compared to 0.5 per cent rise in the BSE Sensex.  </div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe outperformance in the stock came after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on January 8 informed that the Central Bank lifted restrictions imposed on Manappuram Finance arm Asirvad Micro Finance.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"We are pleased to inform you that the Reserve Bank of India, vide its letter dated January 8, 2025, has lifted the restrictions imposed on Asirvad Micro Finance Limited with respect to sanction or disbursal of loans with immediate effect,\" the filing read. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“…having satisfied itself based on companies’ submissions, and in view of their adoption of revamped processes, systems, and the companies’ commitment to ensuring adherence to the regulatory guidelines on an ongoing basis, especially for ensuring fairness in the loan pricing, the RBI has decided to lift the afore-mentioned restrictions placed on both, Asirvad Micro Finance and DMI Finance, with immediate effect”, RBI said in a statement.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe revocation of this ban is a positive development, especially considering it occurred in less than three months, which is significantly shorter than initial base case assumption of six months. This may have been possible due to the constructive efforts made by Asirvad to work with the regulator to have the ban lifted. Additionally, given that the microfinance institution (MFI) sector itself is going through a state of turmoil, Motilal Oswal Financial Services believe the regulator has shown empathy toward the four lenders (including Asirvad) who were previously served business bans.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor Manappuram Finance, the gold loan growth will continue to remain healthy, driven by demand-side tailwinds due to the poor availability of short-term personal and MFI loans. However, we foresee risks of spread compression in its gold loan business, as the company has started focusing on slightly higher ticket size gold loans, the brokerage firm said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile, on January 29, 2025, Smallcap World Fund, Inc acquired an additional 2.4 million equity shares or 0.28 per cent stake in Manappuram Finance through open market deals. Post acquisition, Smallcap World Fund, Inc holding in the company increased to 5.03 per cent from 4.75 per cent, according to stock exchange disclosure.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tManappuram Finance is a NBFC in India, primarily known for its gold loan business. It offers a range of financial services including gold loans, personal loans, microfinance, business loans, insurance, and foreign exchange services. The company provides quick loans against gold jewelry, catering to individuals and businesses in need of immediate liquidity without requiring extensive documentation. Manappuram is also involved in the retail sale of gold coins and bullion.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tManappuram Finance will look to continue its growth journey in the core gold and secured non-gold portfolios.

The NCP leader, now minister for Food and Civil Supplies, is already under fire over the arrest of his aide Walmik Karad in an extortion case related to the murder of sarpanch Santosh Deshmukh in Beed district.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tShiv Sena minister Sanjay Shirsat told reporters that Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis will \"certainly take notice\" of the allegations and order an inquiry. Speaking at a press conference here, Damania presented documents related to the alleged scam.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"These documents are proof of how a minister siphoned off farmers' money and violated laws. As per the government resolution (GR) on DBT, all scheme-related funds were to be transferred directly to farmers' bank accounts, except for certain government entities such as Mahabeej, KVK, and MAIDC, which produce their own goods. However, this rule was disregarded,\" Damania claimed. She referred to a GR dated September 12, 2018, which listed 62 components under DBT.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tWhile the CM had the power to add new components to the DBT list, the existing components could not be removed without approval of a committee of the chief secretary, finance secretary and planning secretary, Damania said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tJust before the Model Code of Conduct for the Lok Sabha elections came into effect, the state government issued a new GR on March 12, 2024, appointing agriculture commissioner as controlling officer for purchasing agricultural inputs, she said. Then agriculture commissioner Pravin Gedam raised concerns on March 15, 2024, stating that implementation of a purchase-based scheme was wrong, the activist claimed. Gedam pointed out that as the items being procured were not produced by Mahabeej or MAIDC, the funds should have been disbursed through DBT to farmers instead of purchasing these items, she said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tGedam told Munde about these irregularities, but the minister advised the Director and Deputy Secretary of the Agriculture Department to proceed with the purchases, Damania alleged. Gedam's comment was not available immediately.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOn March 15, Munde allegedly sought permission from then deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar to issue tenders. Pawar, who heads the Nationalist Congress Party, approved the request, Damania claimed. Then Chief Minister Eknath Shinde approved the removal of certain components from the DBT list, despite not having the authority, she alleged.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe agriculture department under Munde was guilty of major financial irregularities in the procurement of five items, namely, nano urea, nano DAP, battery sprayers, metaldehyde, and cotton bags, the activist said. Nano urea and nano DAP, produced by IFFCO, were purchased at inflated rates. While a 500-millilitre bottle of nano urea was available for Rs 92 in the market, the agriculture department allegedly issued a tender to purchase it for Rs 220 per bottle. A total of 19,68,408 bottles were procured. Similarly, nano DAP, priced at Rs 269 per bottle in the market, was purchased for Rs 590 per bottle, Damania claimed. Battery sprayers, available in the market for Rs 2,496 apiece, were procured for Rs 3,425, she alleged.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tDamania had earlier levelled allegations against Munde regarding his alleged financial links to Walmik Karad. Opposition in Maharashtra has been demanding the minister's resignation since Karad's arrest last month.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"The Chief Minister (Devendra Fadnavis) will certainly take notice of the evidence provided by Damania and conduct enquiry and take action. But seeking Munde's resignation is a matter for (the consideration of) deputy CM Ajit Pawar who heads the NCP,\" said Shiv Sena leader and Social Justice Minister Sanjay Shirsat while speaking to reporters.</p><p></p></div>",

The national capital is likely to witness a three-way contest among the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and the Congress.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tVoting on all 70 constituencies will take place in a single phase on February 5. Polling stations across all constituencies will open at 7 am and close at 6:30 pm. Exit polls, which provide early indications of voter trends, will be released after that.</div>\n<h3>\r\n\tDelhi polls: What are exit polls?</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tExit polls involve surveying voters immediately after they leave polling stations to gauge election outcomes. While they offer insights into possible results, they are not always accurate.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSeveral factors, such as sample selection, margin of error, and the honesty of respondents, influence their reliability. Despite these challenges, exit polls play a key role in shaping post-election discussions.  </div>\n<h3>\r\n\tDelhi elections 2025: When will exit poll results be announced?</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Election Commission has imposed restrictions on the publication of exit polls until 6:30 pm on February 5. The results of any such polls will be made public only after this period.  </div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The Commission notifies the period between 7.00 am to 6.30 pm on 05.02.2025 (Wednesday) as the period during which conducting and publishing or publicising exit poll by means of the print or electronic media or dissemination in any other manner whatsoever, the result of any exit poll in connection with the aforesaid General and bye elections, shall be prohibited,\" the Election Commission stated in a notice issued on February 3.  </div>\n<h3>\r\n\tDelhi Assembly polls: Who are the major pollsters?</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tSeveral media organisations conduct exit polls in collaboration with research agencies. Some of the prominent pollsters include:  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t- Axis My India  </div>\n<div>\r\n\t- CVoter  </div>\n<div>\r\n\t- IPSOS  </div>\n<div>\r\n\t- Jan Ki Baat  </div>\n<div>\r\n\t- Today's Chanakya  </div>\n<h3>\r\n\tDelhi elections 2025: Key constituencies and candidates</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tSome constituencies in Delhi are drawing attention due to the participation of prominent leaders.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>New Delhi constituency:</strong> AAP patron Arvind Kejriwal, BJP’s Parvesh Verma, and Congress candidate Sandeep Dixit, son of former Chief Minister Sheila Dixit, will compete for this high-profile seat.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Patparganj seat:</strong> AAP’s new entrant Avadh Ojha is contesting against BJP’s Ravinder Singh Negi, while Anil Chaudhary represents Congress.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Rohini seat:</strong> In this key North-West Delhi constituency, AAP’s Pradeep Mittal is up against BJP’s sitting MLA Vijender Gupta.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Kalkaji seat:</strong> A three-way contest is expected between incumbent Delhi Chief Minister Atishi Kapoor (AAP), former BJP MP Ramesh Bidhuri, and Congress leader Alka Lamba.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Jangpura constituency:</strong> BJP’s Sardar Tarvinder Singh Marwah is set to challenge AAP’s Manish Sisodia, with Congress fielding Farhad Suri.  </div>\n<h3>\r\n\tDelhi elections 2025: A three-way battle  </h3>\n<div>\r\n\tThe 70-seat Delhi Assembly elections are crucial for AAP, which is aiming for a third consecutive term. Meanwhile, the BJP, riding high on recent victories in Haryana and Maharashtra, is looking to gain ground.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Congress, a part of the INDIA bloc along with AAP at the national level, is also vying to revive its influence in the capital, where it once dominated the political landscape.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWith 699 candidates in the fray across 70 constituencies, the elections will serve as a referendum on AAP’s governance, while also shaping the future of BJP and Congress in Delhi for the next five years. The results on February 8 will determine whether AAP retains power or if BJP and Congress manage to stage a comeback.  </div>\n<h3>\r\n\tDelhi Assembly elections 2020  </h3>\n<div>\r\n\tIn the 2020 Assembly elections, the AAP secured a decisive victory, winning 62 out of 70 seats. The BJP, its closest rival, won only eight seats, while the Congress failed to win any.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAAP’s dominance was even more pronounced in 2015 when it won 67 seats, leaving BJP with just three and Congress with none.  </div>\n<h3>\r\n\tHow accurate were the exit polls in the 2020 Delhi elections?</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tDuring the 2020 elections, exit polls overwhelmingly predicted an AAP victory, with most forecasts giving the party over 50 seats.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndia Today-Axis My India projected the highest range for AAP at 59-68 seats. Meanwhile, Jan Ki Baat, NewsX-Neta, and India News Nation estimated 55 seats for AAP.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTimes Now was one of the few polls to predict a slightly closer contest, giving AAP 47 seats and BJP 23.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tUltimately, the actual results closely aligned with the predictions, as AAP won 62 seats and BJP secured eight. Notably, exit polls in 2020 were more accurate compared to 2015, when predictions had significantly underestimated AAP’s landslide victory.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor live updates and thorough coverage of exit polls, please visit <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com\"><em>Business Standard</em></a>.</div></div>",
