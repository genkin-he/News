These new regulations aim to address regulatory gaps and enhance investor protection.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAlgo trading is already prevalent in the Indian market among both institutional and retail investors. However, the existing regulations had several loopholes, posing risks to investors.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Brokers’ Industry Standards Forum will formulate implementation standards before April 1, 2025, with the new norms becoming effective from August 1. Industry players said the new framework will make algos more accessible to a broader section of investors in a more transparent manner.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile algo providers will not be directly regulated by Sebi, the new guardrails will be implemented through exchanges, which will supervise algo trading and specify the criteria for empanelment.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBrokers will only be able to onboard algo trading providers that are empanelled with the exchanges. They will also need to obtain exchange approval and address grievances and monitor prohibited activities.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tUnder the new norms, open APIs will not be permitted. Access will be granted only through a unique vendor client to ensure identification and traceability.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tInvestors who develop their own algos will need to register with the exchange through their broker if they exceed the specified order-per-second threshold. These investors will be allowed to permit usage of their algos by immediate family members.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAdditionally, “blackbox algos” — those that do not disclose their underlying logic — will need to register as Research Analysts with the market regulator. Any changes to the logic will require re-registration and maintenance of a detailed research report.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Algo orders shall be tagged with a unique identifier provided by the exchange to establish an audit trail. Brokers must seek exchange approval for any modifications to approved algos,” noted Sebi.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAlgo trading involves executing trades based on pre-programmed instructions linked to variables such as price movement and volumes. These tools use logic to automatically buy or sell securities based on their programming.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe exchanges will issue standard operating procedures (SOPs) for testing algos and will monitor the behaviour of all algo orders. Brokers have been directed to conduct due diligence before onboarding algo providers.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Algo providers and brokers may share subscription charges and brokerage collected from clients. However, they must make complete and prominent disclosures of all charges to clients and ensure no conflict of interest arises,” said Sebi.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div></div><div><blockquote class=\"blockquoteBG styleQ1\" style=\"background-color:#FFF5EB;padding:8px;overflow:hidden\">\n<p>\n<strong>TRACING NORMS</strong></p>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\t*  Algo providers must be empanelled with stock exchanges</p>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\t*  Access will be granted only through a unique vendor client to ensure identification and traceability</p>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\t*  ‘Blackbox algos’ must register as research analysts</p>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\t*  Brokers to seek exchange approval for any modifications to approved algos</p>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\t*  New norms will become effective from August 1</p>\n</blockquote></div>\n</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

Credit card loans also saw moderation in growth at 15.6 per cent in December 2024, down from 32.6 per cent a year ago.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBank credit growth in the retail loan segment, including housing, vehicle, credit cards, and personal loans, dropped to 14.9 per cent Y-o-Y in December 2024, down from 17.6 per cent in December 2023.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe gold loan prices increased by 20.4 per cent to Rs 75,857 per 10 gram in December 2024 from Rs 62,993 per 10 gram in the year-ago period.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Factors contributing to the rise in gold loans include rising prices of the yellow metal, as the value of loans taken against jewellery also increases amid rise in gold prices. People with gold jewellery are also borrowing more to refinance their loans as the value of gold increases,” said Kirti Timmanagoudar, head of strategy and co-lending, IIFL Finance.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The crackdown on unsecured lending and stress in the MFI space might also be contributing factors. It is likely a cumulative effect of these elements, rather than one factor being responsible,” said Timmanagoudar.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording RBI data, since May 2024, one bank has changed the classification of agricultural loan into “Loans against gold jewellery” under the retail segment.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Loans previously classified as agricultural are now being treated as gold loans. This reclassification might explain the slower growth in agricultural loans, which have only grown by 8 per cent compared to previous years,” Timmanagoudar added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The slowdown in supply of unsecured lending might give an impetus but gold loan has been witnessing an upward trajectory due to its own features. Today it is a popular choice among customers, especially for short-term requirements, and acts as a vital financial inclusion tool,” said Shaji Varghese, chief executive officer (CEO), Muthoot FinCorp.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe December edition of the financial stability report (FSR) of the RBI observed the rapid increase in gold loan disbursals during the period ending September 2024 compared to the same time period last year.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo address the non-adherence to prudential guidelines by the supervised entities (SEs) in grant of loans against pledge of gold ornaments and jewellery, the RBI has advised SEs to comprehensively review their policies, identify gaps, and implement corrective measures within a specified timeframe.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

Shareholders must be allowed to regulate and determine the affairs of the company through general meetings, which serve as the primary forum for decision-making within a corporate entity,” the court stated.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe HC's decision clears the way for the AGM and the voting on the appointment of a new director to replace Saluja.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHer plea was opposed by four independent directors of the company and the Burman family, the largest shareholder in REL that launched an open offer to acquire an additional 26 per cent stake.

The AGM, originally scheduled for December, was delayed due to legal proceedings before the Madhya Pradesh High Court. A plea filed by a non-shareholder was later dismissed.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn another plea, the Delhi HC refused interim relief to minority shareholder Sapna Govind Rao who had contended that Burmans open offer undervalued the company. However, the court has directed Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to decide fast on the application for exemption filed by US entrepreneur Danny Gaekwad</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThree leading proxy firms — Stakeholders Empowerment Services, Institutional Investor Advisory Services, and InGovern Research — have recommended an 'against' vote on the resolution pertaining to Saluja's reappointment.
