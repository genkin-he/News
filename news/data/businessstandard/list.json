            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tCristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have long been regarded as the two greatest football players of their generation. Since 2007, the duo has set football alight with their extraordinary talent, goal-scoring feats, and longevity in the game. Both have dominated football, breaking countless records, but there are a number of remarkable feats that the Portuguese football sensation has accomplished that are unlikely to be replicated by Messi which is why the 40-year-old can never be . Let’s take a look at five of these outstanding records.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>5. Winning Every Trophy at Two Top Clubs</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRonaldo made history when he became the first player to win every available team and individual honor at two different clubs. He first achieved this feat with Manchester United, and then went one step further by doing the same with Real Madrid. While Messi accomplished similar success with Barcelona, the challenge of winning every major title at two different clubs is something Ronaldo has done that Messi will never replicate—especially due to Messi’s long-standing commitment to Barcelona.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <strong>ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/sports/football-news/birthday-boy-ronaldo-proclaims-himself-best-footballer-in-history-125020500572_1.html\">Birthday boy Ronaldo proclaims himself 'best footballer in history'</a></strong></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>4. Scoring 50+ Goals for Six Consecutive Seasons</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFrom the 2010/11 season to the 2015/16 season, Ronaldo managed to score at least 50 goals in every competition for six consecutive seasons with Real Madrid. This incredible achievement has yet to be matched by any other player, including Messi, who only managed to reach the 50-goal mark three times in a row. Ronaldo’s remarkable consistency in front of goal makes this record seem all but unbreakable for Messi.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>3. Top Scorer in the Champions League for Six Consecutive Seasons</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCristiano Ronaldo has dominated the Champions League over the years, particularly in terms of goal-scoring. He has been the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons—a record that Messi has never come close to matching. Messi’s personal best is three consecutive top scorer titles, which is impressive but far from Ronaldo's unparalleled achievement. With Messi now in his early thirties, this record seems safe in Ronaldo’s hands.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>2. Scoring 40+ Goals in a Season for Two Top Clubs</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRonaldo achieved the feat of scoring 40+ goals in a single season with two different clubs: Manchester United and Real Madrid. In the 2007/08 season, Ronaldo netted 40 goals for United and replicated the performance with 53 goals for Real Madrid in 2010/11. This record could have been a potential target for Messi had he moved to another top league. However, Messi’s refusal to leave Barcelona means that this extraordinary record will likely remain untouched.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <strong>ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/sports/other-sports-news/simona-halep-announces-her-retirement-after-two-grand-slam-titles-125020500184_1.html\">Simona Halep announces her retirement after two Grand Slam titles</a></strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>1. Being the First Player to Feature in the FIFA World XI for Three Separate Teams</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCristiano Ronaldo made history by becoming the first player to be named in the FIFA World XI while playing for three different clubs: Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Juventus. This achievement, which was first recorded at the end of 2018, marks a level of consistency and excellence across multiple teams that Messi is unlikely to replicate. Given Messi's long association with Barcelona and his eventual move to Paris Saint-Germain, this unique record remains beyond his reach.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCristiano Ronaldo has set numerous records throughout his illustrious career, and while Lionel Messi is undoubtedly one of the greatest to ever play the game, there are a few milestones that seem destined to remain solely within Ronaldo's domain. From winning every major trophy at two clubs to consistently dominating the Champions League, these incredible feats have solidified Ronaldo's place in football history.</div></div>",

One has been granted registration while four others are being verified, they said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOn January 27, the BJP-ruled Uttarakhand became the first state in Independent India to implement the Uniform Civil Code, which promotes equal laws for every citizen across all religions and standardises personal laws on marriage, divorce and property.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOn the occasion, Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami launched a portal designed for the mandatory online registration of marriages, divorce and live-in relationships. He was the first to register his marriage on the UCC portal.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe UCC's provision for mandatory registration of live-in relationships has been much criticised for its potential to infringe upon people's right to privacy.

Otherwise, at least those who favoured its introduction during consultations with the drafting committee as claimed by the government-appointed panel would have come forward to apply for registration,\" another high court lawyer Dushyant Mainali told PTI.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAnother possibility for this kind of initial response may be that people are not ready to disclose the details of their personal relationships on an official platform or they are not fully aware of the provisions of the UCC that include strict penal provisions for live-in couples who do not apply for registration of their relationship within a specified timeframe, he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAs per the provisions of the UCC, if a live-in couple fails to submit a statement of their relationship within one month of entering into the alliance to the authorities concerned, they shall be punished on conviction by a judicial magistrate with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three months or a fine not exceeding Rs 10,000 or both.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe UCC says the punishment will extend to an imprisonment of up to six months and a fine of up to Rs 25,000 or both if a live-in couple does not apply for registration of their relationship even after being required to do so by a notice.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, it is too early to come to any definitive conclusions about the UCC, Mainali said, adding that more people may comply with the law as they get a better understanding of the UCC and its provisions.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"However, people's initial response to it does show that the UCC was more on the political agenda of the state government than on people's mind,\" Mainali added.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",

Chennai.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTwo sources said Kia's case was similar to that of Volkswagen, accused of evading a higher tax of 30 per cent to 35 per cent applicable on parts imported in \"completely knocked

concerns only the Carnival model, a seven-seater priced around $73,500, which is among its most expensive cars in India.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Kia could face $310 mn payout</strong></p>\n<p>\r\n\tIndian

the year, for net profit of $243 million.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLast week, India slashed import duties on fully-built high-end motorcycles to 30 per cent, in a move widely seen as looking to placate US President Donald Trump, who has in the past called India a \"tariff king\".</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBut fully-assembled imported cars still attract a levy of more than 100 per cent.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tKia has
