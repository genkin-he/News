Shareholders must be allowed to regulate and determine the affairs of the company through general meetings, which serve as the primary forum for decision-making within a corporate entity,” the court stated.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe HC's decision clears the way for the AGM and the voting on the appointment of a new director to replace Saluja.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHer plea was opposed by four independent directors of the company and the Burman family, the largest shareholder in REL that launched an open offer to acquire an additional 26 per cent stake. The open offer, which closes on Friday, has so far received bids for only 1,668 shares.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSaluja has offered herself for reappointment, and the outcome of the voting will be known at the AGM. The AGM, originally scheduled for December, was delayed due to legal proceedings before the Madhya Pradesh High Court. A plea filed by a non-shareholder was later dismissed.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn another plea, the Delhi HC refused interim relief to minority shareholder Sapna Govind Rao who had contended that Burmans open offer undervalued the company. However, the court has directed Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to decide fast on the application for exemption filed by US entrepreneur Danny Gaekwad</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThree leading proxy firms — Stakeholders Empowerment Services, Institutional Investor Advisory Services, and InGovern Research — have recommended an 'against' vote on the resolution pertaining to Saluja's reappointment. They cited concerns over corporate governance, ESOPs, and higher remuneration.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRefuting these concerns, REL described the reports as “orchestrated and motivated” and questioned the timing of the advisory firms' reports.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe company stated that matters regarding compensation practices and ESOPs were sub-judice and that any attempt to influence public opinion through “misleading analysis” was unethical.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters last week, \"We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance.\" \"Labor demand is softening but not collapsing,\" said Eugenio Aleman, chief economist at Raymond James.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tJob openings, a measure of labor demand, decreased 556,000 to 7.6 million on the last day of December, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said. The decline was the largest since October 2023.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tData for November was revised higher to show 8.156 million vacancies instead of the previously reported 8.098 million.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast 8.0 million unfilled positions.

The job openings rate dropped to 4.5 per cent from 4.9 per cent in November.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tLayoffs fell 29,000 to 1.771 million as increases in transportation, warehousing and utilities as well as mining and logging were more than offset by decreases in professional and business services. There were also fewer leisure and hospitality layoffs.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe layoffs rate was unchanged at 1.1 per cent for a fourth straight month. It is, however, becoming harder for laid-off workers to find new jobs as employers remain cautious about adding headcount.
