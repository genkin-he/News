MmWave or spectrum bands above 24 gigahertz (GHz) are a valuable resource when targeting densely populated urban areas. The high band offers an opportunity for service providers to offer unprecedented peak rates, low latency, and high capacity.</div></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tTrai has said telecom players will have the option to pay for the spectrum upfront or in 20 equal annual instalments. While mmWave is limited due to signals not being able to travel as far as mid and low-band signals, they often travel less than a mile and are more susceptible to interference from things such as trees, buildings, and even glass. But the benefit of millimeter wave spectrum is if the signal is unencumbered, users can get connection speeds between 1 Gbps to 3 Gbps or even higher.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe regulator has recommended that in addition to the access service providers, internet and machine-to-machine service providers should also be permitted to participate in the auction.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIn April last year, Trai had issued a consultation paper on the issue. Subsequently, 12 stakeholders have submitted comments, and four furnished counter-comments. On Tuesday, it released its recommendations on what the block sizes for the spectrum bands and the reserve prices for MHz in the 37-40 GHz band should be. This ranges from a high of Rs 76 lakh in the metro circle of Delhi, to Rs 3 lakh in J&amp;K and North East.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tHowever, Trai has pointed out some bands can’t be opened up. “Owing to the non-availability of the device ecosystem in 42.5-43.5 GHz frequency range, it will be prudent that the frequency range 42.5-43.5 GHz is not put to auction in the forthcoming spectrum auction. DoT may send a separate reference for seeking the authority’s recommendations for 42.5-43.5 GHz frequency range for IMT at an appropriate time,” Trai said. Telcos had earlier pushed for opening up spectrum in this band.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tWhile the 37-37.5 GHz has been globally earmarked for broadband mobile use, the 37.5-40 GHz and 40-42.5 GHz bands have both mobile use and satellite gateway link uses. Similarly, while the 40-42.5 GHz band is only for satellite usage, the 42.5-43.5 GHz band has both usage. While telcos had called for flexible use between terrestrial and satellite-based networks, arguing there would be no interference, Trai hasn’t clarified its stance on the matter.</div>\n<div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small></div></div>",

He is likely to land in India late on Tuesday night.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe OpenAI founder is also scheduled to address the developer ecosystem and the venture capitalists during his short stay in the country, a person aware of the development said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPeakXV Managing Director Rajan Anandan as well as executives from venture capital (VC) firms will also be meeting Altman, sources told Business Standard.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAltman is on a whirlwind tour of several countries, including Germany, Japan, South Korea, and the UAE.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe OpenAI founder was in India in June of 2023. His current Asia visit is being seen by many as a rush to counter the impact of DeepSeek's achievement. The Chinese firm has shown the world that foundational models can be built at a fraction of the cost of what OpenAI has managed to do with.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn January 4, OpenAI announced that it will develop AI products for South Korea with chat app operators Kakao. This will be its second major alliance with an Asian player. Earlier this year, OpenAI along with SoftBank announced the Stargate program. This program is planning to invest $500 billion to build AI infrastructure in the US. OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and MGX are the initial investors of $100 billion.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn his earlier visit to India, Altman had courted controversy when he said that companies across the world, including in India, could try to build a product like ChatGPT or a company like OpenAI but would fail.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“It's totally impossible to rival us in training these core models, and we'll advise you not to even attempt it. But it's your responsibility to try anyway. I genuinely believe in both those aspects. I reckon it's quite a futile pursuit,” Altman had then said at an event.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFollowing backlash over his comments, Altman had later clarified that his comments had been taken out of context.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“this is really taken out of context! the question was about competing with us with $10 million, which i really do think is not going to work. but i still said try! however, i think it’s the wrong question,” Altman had said in a tweet.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn a second tweet, he had also said that he had “no doubt” that Indian startups could do what had never been done before and contribute a new thing to the world.</div></div>",
