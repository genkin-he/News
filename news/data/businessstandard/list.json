It noted that tax measures will bolster middle-class spending power and consumption.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFitch Ratings said the Budget would be broadly neutral for growth and continued to project real GDP expansion of 6.4 per cent in FY25 and 6.5 per cent in FY26. Tax cuts, Fitch Ratings said, may provide a modest consumption boost.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tS&amp;P said the slower growth in capital investments for FY26 does not suggest a deterioration in the quality of government spending. “India’s Union Budget remains in line with our expectation of gradual fiscal consolidation… We believe bottlenecks in executing infrastructure projects will ease as supply chain pressures lessen and general elections are over,” S&amp;P Global Ratings said in a press statement.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tS&amp;P said the Budget allocation for capital expenditure is 3.1 per cent of GDP, unchanged from last financial year and is an increase of 10 per cent year-on-year in absolute terms.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe central government has lowered its fiscal deficit estimate for FY25 to 4.8 per cent of GDP from 4.9 per cent while budgeting a fiscal deficit of 4.4 per cent of GDP for FY26.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tS&amp;P has projected that, combined with central government deficits that may trend down to 4.2 per cent of GDP by FY28, the general government fiscal deficit could gradually decrease to 6.8 per cent of GDP from 7.8 per cent in FY25.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tS&amp;P also said the upgrade trigger for its sovereign ratings rests on a meaningful narrowing of India’s fiscal deficits, such that the net change in its general government debt falls below 7 per cent of GDP on a structural basis. “But a lower debt-to-GDP ratio for India would not necessarily lead to an improved debt burden score. This is due to the country’s very high ratio of government interest servicing to revenue,” S&amp;P said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNoting that fiscal deficit projections seemed realistic, Fitch Ratings said there was a risk of modest slippage in revenue collection targets amid a recent moderation in economic growth. “We expect government capex to remain relatively high, but overall, the fiscal deficit reduction is likely to be slightly contractionary,” Fitch Ratings said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHighlighting that the Budget promotes private and state investments in infrastructure and energy transition, Moody's Ratings said the boost to spending due to rising disposable income would benefit makers of two-wheelers, passenger vehicles and white goods, and ride-hailing service providers.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The latest budget signals a slowing pace of fiscal consolidation, as the government seeks to provide firmer support for economic growth amid a dampened macroeconomic backdrop compared to recent years. Still, we expect the government is within reach of its near-term deficit target of 4.5 per cent by FY26,” Moody’s Ratings said.</div></div>",
