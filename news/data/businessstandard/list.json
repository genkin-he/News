The rise in capital expenditure (Capex) budget, projected to exceed $1.2 trillion by 2030, is set to benefit banks and infrastructure NBFCs. Additionally, sectors such as urban housing, insurance, and defense-related industries look favorable due to long-term policy support.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile consumption-driven companies are considered overvalued, consumer finance, electric vehicles (EVs), and tourism—particularly religious tourism—are emerging as compelling investment opportunities. Additionally, India’s growing IT market, fueled by AI advancements, presents substantial long-term growth potential.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Here are the key sectors selected for investment: </strong></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n\t\tCapex budget has risen 15% CAGR in the past 10 years, allocation until 2030 likely to exceed $1.2 trillion. Large capex investments likely to be beneficial for Banks and specialized infra NBFCs</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tConsumer finance companies available at a more reasonable valuation</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tEVs, Mobility, Tourism, and religious tourism provide interesting opportunities</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tDeepSeek has expanded the market for IT, but near-term growth rates and valuations a concern</li>\n</ul>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Capex budget</strong></div>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile the showstopper in this budget was the zero income tax for those incurring Rs 12 lakh of salary, there was a lot of capex and infrastructure allocation which was not in the limelight. From 2014-15 where capex was 20% of the total budget, it has increased to 31% this year. Capex budget has been growing at nearly 15% CAGR over the last 10 years compared to the revenue budget which has grown at around 10% CAGR.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Sectors in focus</strong></div>\n<div>\r\n\tSuch large capex investments are likely to be beneficial to Banks and specialized infrastructure NBFCs. Further, the focus on power sector “nudge” reforms, which encourage state discoms to focus on timely payments to generators, are likely to benefit the whole power ecosystem. Housing and Urbanization focus would benefit housing finance companies. Besides these, Defence, Railways, and Construction and Engineering and EPC companies would benefit to a large extent.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tArvind Kothari, smallcase Manager and Founder of Niveshaay highlighted power, transformers, and clean energy sectors are attractive investment opportunities, especially with the government’s continued focus on energy transition, infrastructure development, and sustainability. The Budget’s increased allocation towards renewable energy, grid modernization, and EV infrastructure is set to drive robust growth in these areas. He also pointed out PLI schemes have significantly accelerated the growth of textile companies by enhancing manufacturing capabilities and promoting exports. The Budget’s focus on boosting domestic production, coupled with favorable policies, is expected to further strengthen this sector.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Consumption sector is a big winner</strong></div>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile consumption is likely to benefit, most of the consumption companies are extremely overvalued. smallcase managers believe that consumer finance companies could be a way to play this at a more reasonable valuation. Also, EVs and other means of mobility could provide interesting opportunities. Another sector which could be interesting due to the tax benefits and the budget focus on the sector is Tourism, especially, religious tourism.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSonam Srivastava, smallcase Manager, and Founder of Wright Research said, “Retail consumption remains a theme for investment. Trent, Zomato and Dixon Tech are available at attractive valuations currently. We also have a bias towards defensives, capital market focused companies, pharma and hospitals. Electronic manufacturing, Banks and IT sectors also look interesting at the current juncture.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>DeepSeek and IT sector</strong></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIT remains an interesting play with DeepSeek catalyzing an extraordinarily large TAM (total addressable market) for Indian IT services companies. With the cost of training new AI models being brought down to 1/30th to 1/50th of the earlier paradigm, this makes it possible for small and mid-sized companies and startups to develop new models and launch numerous products based on AI in the next 2-10 years. This enlarges the market for Indian IT services many fold. However, with some uncertainty on the near-term growth rates and valuations slightly high, IT remains potentially alpha-generating.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t “Toy industry is a $400 billion global market, with significant manufacturing happening in China. The budget has allocated funds for the toy manufacturing industry, which could lead to significant growth in the next 10-15 years. At a macro level, we need the economy to clock over 7.5-8% for long-term growth of the market and currency,\" said Ambareesh Baliga, veteran market expert and smallcase Manager.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDr. Vikas Gupta, smallcase Manager &amp; Founder of OmniScience Capital said, “The US Tariffs on China is a big opportunity for India. At a macro level, Trump favors a weak dollar to increase competitiveness of American exports. Add to that it is challenging for the RBI to cut rates given the fall in INR, the central bank may look at other ways to boost market liquidity given INR fall, largely the street is expecting a 25 bps rate cut by the RBI this week.\"</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

Shanmugam said the Bill brought these powers together in one place, while affirming the importance of racial harmony in the multi-ethnic city-state.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe new law empowers the authorities to issue restraining orders against individuals involved in making content that prejudices Singapore's racial harmony, taking close reference from the existing Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act (MRHA).</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIt also introduces a community remedial initiative, which gives those who have committed less egregious race-related offences a chance to mend community ties in lieu of prosecution.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"We have always treated racial harmony as being fundamental in Singapore, and so this Bill has to be seen in that context, Shanmugam said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Multiracialism, underpinned by racial harmony, is a foundational principle for us,\" local media reports had the Minister as saying in the house.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tDuring the debate on the bill, Shanmugam sought to allay concerns that the legislative changes would curtail free speech.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMembers of parliament had raised concerns that the Government's new power to issue restraining orders could stifle legitimate discourse and sought clarity on scenarios where this power would be used.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMinister Shanmugam said the best evidence of how these powers are likely to be used is how the Government has used similar powers it has had since the MRHA was enacted in 1990.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNo orders have been issued under the MRHA to date, but the legal framework means everyone understands what is not allowed in Singapore, he added.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\t\"That gives you an indication of how the Government approaches these powers. The important thing is to have the powers, but also to be very, very careful and judicious in how you use them, he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Minister cited a previous case where a preacher made highly disparaging remarks on YouTube about Buddhism and Taoism. Officials spoke to the preacher, who agreed to withdraw his remarks.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"We didn't need to resort to issuing an order... the fact that we had the power helped, and after that, others took reference from that (case), Shanmugam said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tShanmugam said the scope of unacceptable conduct regarding race relations remains substantively the same, as offences under the new law cover what is already in the Penal Code.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tReferring to online comments that call for 'Palestine to be free', the Minister pointed out that these are not calls for violence here but expressions of opinion.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tResponding to a question, Shanmugam said acts that did not flout existing racial harmony laws will still not be offences, but added that there are other laws governing protected places and which regulate public assemblies.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"I would suggest, therefore, a careful understanding of the (Bill's) provisions. Otherwise, there is a serious risk that the public may be misled, he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tShanmugam noted that the new law has safeguards in place beyond the minister who issues the restraining order, as such an application would have to be sent to a new Presidential Council for Racial and Religious Harmony, which will make recommendations to the president on whether to confirm, cancel or vary the order.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Minister said he agreed entirely that Singapore must remain open, and a consistent message by government leaders here over the last 60 years is that the nation must be open and interact with the world.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYet, it also means that groups like clan associations can potentially be vectors of influence from countries that want to influence Singapore's politics, he added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe authorities have engaged many race-based entities here, and they understand and accept the need for such safeguards, said Shanmugam.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe intent is to safeguard from malicious foreign influence, not to curtail legitimate exchanges, business deals or trade promotion activities conducted by our clan or business associations, he added.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tGerald Giam, a member of parliament from the opposition Workers' Party had expressed concern that genuine dialogue about racial issues will be curtailed under the new Act, citing the examples of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe scope of unacceptable conduct regarding race relations will remain substantially the same as today. There is, in fact, no change in the law, said Shanmugam.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSome updates will be made to align the language and defences under the Bill with the equal provision. So, the changes are that we actually provided for some additional defences, and in fact, narrowed one of the provisions.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe agree entirely that Singapore must remain open. We must be able to reach out to the world. In fact, we have to for our success, said Shanmugam, responding to a question about the new Act deterring clans and business associations from interacting with foreigners and foreign entities altogether.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tEconomically, we'll be finished if we don't interact. Socially, we are such a small place, we need to get ideas from outside, and then we need to adapt the ideas that work for us to our own situations, Channel News Asia quoted the Minister as responding to concerns raised by parliamentarians.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe main issue, he noted, is that those groups could potentially be vectors of influence from countries that want to influence our politics. Evidence from around the world gives Singapore some reasons to be concerned about this, said Shanmugam.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe likened the safeguards under the new Act to the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act, which subjects MPs and Cabinet ministers to similar measures, to prevent them from being used in the same way by foreign actors.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tNothing in the Bill is meant to suggest that foreign influence is in itself undesirable, and designation under this Bill as a race-based entity does not imply any wrongdoing, said Shanmugam.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt simply means that the entities or the entity has engaged in activities that relate to race, which sometimes is its raison d'etre.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tShanmugam emphasised that such clans and associations are important for Singapore. They play a constructive role in building social bonds and preserving traditions and cultures while strengthening business networks too, he said.</p><p></p></div>",

Shanmugam said the Bill brought these powers together in one place, while affirming the importance of racial harmony in the multi-ethnic city-state.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe new law empowers the authorities to issue restraining orders against individuals involved in making content that prejudices Singapore's racial harmony, taking close reference from the existing Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act (MRHA).</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIt also introduces a community remedial initiative, which gives those who have committed less egregious race-related offences a chance to mend community ties in lieu of prosecution.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"We have always treated racial harmony as being fundamental in Singapore, and so this Bill has to be seen in that context, Shanmugam said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Multiracialism, underpinned by racial harmony, is a foundational principle for us,\" local media reports had the Minister as saying in the house.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tDuring the debate on the bill, Shanmugam sought to allay concerns that the legislative changes would curtail free speech.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMembers of parliament had raised concerns that the Government's new power to issue restraining orders could stifle legitimate discourse and sought clarity on scenarios where this power would be used.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMinister Shanmugam said the best evidence of how these powers are likely to be used is how the Government has used similar powers it has had since the MRHA was enacted in 1990.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNo orders have been issued under the MRHA to date, but the legal framework means everyone understands what is not allowed in Singapore, he added.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\t\"That gives you an indication of how the Government approaches these powers. The important thing is to have the powers, but also to be very, very careful and judicious in how you use them, he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Minister cited a previous case where a preacher made highly disparaging remarks on YouTube about Buddhism and Taoism. Officials spoke to the preacher, who agreed to withdraw his remarks.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"We didn't need to resort to issuing an order... the fact that we had the power helped, and after that, others took reference from that (case), Shanmugam said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tShanmugam said the scope of unacceptable conduct regarding race relations remains substantively the same, as offences under the new law cover what is already in the Penal Code.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tReferring to online comments that call for 'Palestine to be free', the Minister pointed out that these are not calls for violence here but expressions of opinion.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tResponding to a question, Shanmugam said acts that did not flout existing racial harmony laws will still not be offences, but added that there are other laws governing protected places and which regulate public assemblies.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"I would suggest, therefore, a careful understanding of the (Bill's) provisions. Otherwise, there is a serious risk that the public may be misled, he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tShanmugam noted that the new law has safeguards in place beyond the minister who issues the restraining order, as such an application would have to be sent to a new Presidential Council for Racial and Religious Harmony, which will make recommendations to the president on whether to confirm, cancel or vary the order.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Minister said he agreed entirely that Singapore must remain open, and a consistent message by government leaders here over the last 60 years is that the nation must be open and interact with the world.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYet, it also means that groups like clan associations can potentially be vectors of influence from countries that want to influence Singapore's politics, he added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe authorities have engaged many race-based entities here, and they understand and accept the need for such safeguards, said Shanmugam.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe intent is to safeguard from malicious foreign influence, not to curtail legitimate exchanges, business deals or trade promotion activities conducted by our clan or business associations, he added.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tGerald Giam, a member of parliament from the opposition Workers' Party had expressed concern that genuine dialogue about racial issues will be curtailed under the new Act, citing the examples of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe scope of unacceptable conduct regarding race relations will remain substantially the same as today. There is, in fact, no change in the law, said Shanmugam.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSome updates will be made to align the language and defences under the Bill with the equal provision. So, the changes are that we actually provided for some additional defences, and in fact, narrowed one of the provisions.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe agree entirely that Singapore must remain open. We must be able to reach out to the world. In fact, we have to for our success, said Shanmugam, responding to a question about the new Act deterring clans and business associations from interacting with foreigners and foreign entities altogether.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tEconomically, we'll be finished if we don't interact. Socially, we are such a small place, we need to get ideas from outside, and then we need to adapt the ideas that work for us to our own situations, Channel News Asia quoted the Minister as responding to concerns raised by parliamentarians.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe main issue, he noted, is that those groups could potentially be vectors of influence from countries that want to influence our politics. Evidence from around the world gives Singapore some reasons to be concerned about this, said Shanmugam.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe likened the safeguards under the new Act to the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act, which subjects MPs and Cabinet ministers to similar measures, to prevent them from being used in the same way by foreign actors.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tNothing in the Bill is meant to suggest that foreign influence is in itself undesirable, and designation under this Bill as a race-based entity does not imply any wrongdoing, said Shanmugam.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt simply means that the entities or the entity has engaged in activities that relate to race, which sometimes is its raison d'etre.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tShanmugam emphasised that such clans and associations are important for Singapore. They play a constructive role in building social bonds and preserving traditions and cultures while strengthening business networks too, he said.</p><p></p></div>",
