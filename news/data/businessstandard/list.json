But it is not yet clear how much that will be.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nUBS says existing capital requirements are appropriate and has warned the Swiss government that excessive demands could make the financial sector less competitive.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nThe fourth quarter saw UBS post net profit attributable to shareholders of $770 million, its fourth consecutive quarter of profit.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nThat far exceeded an average estimate of $483 million in a company-provided poll, with UBS benefitting from lower-than-expected costs, robust revenue and a strong performance by its investment bank.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\n\"We achieved all key integration milestones in 2024 and significantly reduced execution risk, while our capital position remained robust,\" UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti said in a statement.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\n\"We are confident in our ability to substantially complete the integration by the end of 2026,\" and achieve financial targets and growth initiatives, he added.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nUBS said it was on track to achieve planned cost savings, though it raised its forecast for integration-related expenses to $14 billion by the end of 2026, up from $13 billion.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nDuring a call to discuss the results with analysts, Ermotti urged Switzerland not to saddle UBS with capital requirements that could hurt returns to shareholders.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\n\"Offsetting the consequences of higher requirements would make us uncompetitive domestically and abroad, hamper our ability to help clients grow, and importantly, make banking services more expensive for Swiss families and enterprises in the long run,\" he said.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\n\"It will also damage the nation's standing as an attractive global financial center, and ultimately hurt our position as the third-largest private employer in Switzerland.\"<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<strong>INTEGRATION</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nTotal revenues at the bank climbed 7% to $11.6 billion year-on-year, narrowly beating the company-provided consensus forecast of $11.5 billion.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nThe bank said it would maintain its target common equity tier 1 capital (CET1) ratio of around 14%.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nAnalysts at Bank Vontobel lauded UBS for \"good cost management\" though Citi analysts noted overall cost saving and cost-income guidance through end-2026 remained unchanged and gave a neutral rating.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\n\"On balance a decent set of results, but perhaps not as good as at first glance,\" the Citi analysts wrote.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nNet new assets attracted in global wealth management during the quarter amounted to $18 billion, missing a forecast of $21 billion from Zuercher Kantonalbank analysts.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\r\nErmotti said last week the migrating of Credit Suisse clients to its IT system was going well, but that it would remain a major focal point for the next 12 months.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small><br/></div>",

The way he utilises his bowlers, like bringing in Mohammad Shami during critical phases or strategically using spinners, is commendable. This could be his last ICC trophy as captain. Winning the Champions Trophy would make him the first Indian player to win four ICC trophies—a phenomenal feat.\"</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRaina also pointed out Rohit’s recent batting transformation. \"After the ODI World Cup, his strike rate has soared to 119-120.
