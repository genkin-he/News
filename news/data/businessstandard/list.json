These new regulations aim to address regulatory gaps and enhance investor protection.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAlgo trading is already prevalent in the Indian market among both institutional and retail investors. However, the existing regulations had several loopholes, posing risks to investors.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Brokers’ Industry Standards Forum will formulate implementation standards before April 1, 2025, with the new norms becoming effective from August 1. Industry players said the new framework will make algos more accessible to a broader section of investors in a more transparent manner.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile algo providers will not be directly regulated by Sebi, the new guardrails will be implemented through exchanges, which will supervise algo trading and specify the criteria for empanelment.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBrokers will only be able to onboard algo trading providers that are empanelled with the exchanges. They will also need to obtain exchange approval and address grievances and monitor prohibited activities.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tUnder the new norms, open APIs will not be permitted. Access will be granted only through a unique vendor client to ensure identification and traceability.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tInvestors who develop their own algos will need to register with the exchange through their broker if they exceed the specified order-per-second threshold. These investors will be allowed to permit usage of their algos by immediate family members.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAdditionally, “blackbox algos” — those that do not disclose their underlying logic — will need to register as Research Analysts with the market regulator. Any changes to the logic will require re-registration and maintenance of a detailed research report.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Algo orders shall be tagged with a unique identifier provided by the exchange to establish an audit trail. Brokers must seek exchange approval for any modifications to approved algos,” noted Sebi.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAlgo trading involves executing trades based on pre-programmed instructions linked to variables such as price movement and volumes. These tools use logic to automatically buy or sell securities based on their programming.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe exchanges will issue standard operating procedures (SOPs) for testing algos and will monitor the behaviour of all algo orders. Brokers have been directed to conduct due diligence before onboarding algo providers.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Algo providers and brokers may share subscription charges and brokerage collected from clients. However, they must make complete and prominent disclosures of all charges to clients and ensure no conflict of interest arises,” said Sebi.</div></div>",

It noted that tax measures will bolster middle-class spending power and consumption.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFitch Ratings said the Budget would be broadly neutral for growth and continued to project real GDP expansion of 6.4 per cent in FY25 and 6.5 per cent in FY26. Tax cuts, Fitch Ratings said, may provide a modest consumption boost.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tS&amp;P said the slower growth in capital investments for FY26 does not suggest a deterioration in the quality of government spending. “India’s Union Budget remains in line with our expectation of gradual fiscal consolidation… We believe bottlenecks in executing infrastructure projects will ease as supply chain pressures lessen and general elections are over,” S&amp;P Global Ratings said in a press statement.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tS&amp;P said the Budget allocation for capital expenditure is 3.1 per cent of GDP, unchanged from last financial year and is an increase of 10 per cent year-on-year in absolute terms.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe central government has lowered its fiscal deficit estimate for FY25 to 4.8 per cent of GDP from 4.9 per cent while budgeting a fiscal deficit of 4.4 per cent of GDP for FY26.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tS&amp;P has projected that, combined with central government deficits that may trend down to 4.2 per cent of GDP by FY28, the general government fiscal deficit could gradually decrease to 6.8 per cent of GDP from 7.8 per cent in FY25.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tS&amp;P also said the upgrade trigger for its sovereign ratings rests on a meaningful narrowing of India’s fiscal deficits, such that the net change in its general government debt falls below 7 per cent of GDP on a structural basis. “But a lower debt-to-GDP ratio for India would not necessarily lead to an improved debt burden score. This is due to the country’s very high ratio of government interest servicing to revenue,” S&amp;P said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNoting that fiscal deficit projections seemed realistic, Fitch Ratings said there was a risk of modest slippage in revenue collection targets amid a recent moderation in economic growth. “We expect government capex to remain relatively high, but overall, the fiscal deficit reduction is likely to be slightly contractionary,” Fitch Ratings said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHighlighting that the Budget promotes private and state investments in infrastructure and energy transition, Moody's Ratings said the boost to spending due to rising disposable income would benefit makers of two-wheelers, passenger vehicles and white goods, and ride-hailing service providers.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The latest budget signals a slowing pace of fiscal consolidation, as the government seeks to provide firmer support for economic growth amid a dampened macroeconomic backdrop compared to recent years. Still, we expect the government is within reach of its near-term deficit target of 4.5 per cent by FY26,” Moody’s Ratings said.</div></div>",

He added that university education, in its current form, is a 20th-century creation.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"The way we give out education in the lecture format, which is still the dominant format of education, especially for the higher end of high school and certainly for most universities, is outdated. I personally cannot see how we do not have to completely restructure this,\" he said.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSanyal stated that universities need to focus on creating new knowledge through research and development (R&amp;D). \"Universities will increasingly focus on finding new frontiers of knowledge. Interestingly, their competitors will not be other universities but private or government R&amp;D labs and other spheres that enable new knowledge creation,\" he said. He also suggested that universities could evolve into innovation or startup hubs.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAcknowledging that some disciplines may be exceptions, he said, \"We cannot teach surgery in this particular (AI) format, and there must be other subjects as well. But for a very large part of the education system, you can now essentially automate.\" He elaborated that AI can facilitate personalised learning based on an individual's level of understanding and pace.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDiscussing the perils of AI, he cautioned that in subjects like humanities, there is potential for monoculture, leading to the perpetuation of ideological or preconceived notions.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe also emphasised that AI technology may struggle to create new areas of knowledge that require non-standardised ways of thinking. \"The way AI exists today, it is essentially mining information in various ways. So, if I came up with a completely radical new way of thinking about something, AI would definitely mark me down,\" he explained.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
