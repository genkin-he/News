Globally, the Group has presence across, the US, UK, UAE, Costa Rica, Nepal and Sri Lanka.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMuthoot Finance is one of the best franchises for gold loans in the country, as is evident from its ability to deliver stronger gold loan growth and best-in-class profitability.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn the first half (April to September) of the financial year 2025-25 (H1FY25), the company’s standalone loan assets under management  (AUM) reached a historic high of Rs 90,197 crore, driven by a robust 28 per cent year-on-year (YoY) growth in core gold loan portfolio. The standalone profit after tax grew by 18 per cent YoY at Rs 2,330 crore. This half year saw the highest-ever gold loan disbursements to new customers of Rs 10,687 crore to 9.66 lakh customers.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn Q2FY25, the company crossed the historic milestone of Rs 1 trillion in consolidated loan AUM. In Q2FY25, it recorded a net profit of Rs 1,321 crore, registering a 21 per cent YoY growth, and its total revenue from operations surged by 36.7 per cent to Rs 4,928.8 crore.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tManagement acknowledged that the competitive aggression from banks in gold loans has reduced. Additionally, lower availability of unsecured credit in the form of personal loans/MFI loans have resulted in stronger demand for gold loans. Management also indicated that some of the Fintechs/ NBFCs have calibrated their lending into unsecured loans. This suggests that the strong gold loan demand could sustain in the near term, according to Motilal Oswal Financial Services.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWith a favorable demand outlook for gold loans driven by reduced competition from banks and limited availability of unsecured credit, the company is well positioned to maintain its growth momentum. However, we would continue to watch out for any increase in competitive intensity and the impact of any decline in gold prices in H2FY25, the brokerage firm said in Q2 result update.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGold AUM growth remains strong backed by high gold prices and moderating competitive intensity. Further, growth guidance has been revised upwards to 25 per cent vs 15 per cent while need to watch out for higher credit cost as stage III assets have increased in last few quarters, said analyst at IDBI Capital in result update.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
