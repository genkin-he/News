Tax cuts, Fitch Ratings said, may provide a modest consumption boost.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tS&amp;P said the slower growth in capital investments for FY26 does not suggest a deterioration in the quality of government spending. “India’s Union Budget remains in line with our expectation of gradual fiscal consolidation… We believe bottlenecks in executing infrastructure projects will ease as supply chain pressures lessen and general elections are over,” S&amp;P Global Ratings said in a press statement.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tS&amp;P said the Budget allocation for capital expenditure is 3.1 per cent of GDP, unchanged from last financial year and is an increase of 10 per cent year-on-year in absolute terms.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe central government has lowered its fiscal deficit estimate for FY25 to 4.8 per cent of GDP from 4.9 per cent while budgeting a fiscal deficit of 4.4 per cent of GDP for FY26.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tS&amp;P has projected that, combined with central government deficits that may trend down to 4.2 per cent of GDP by FY28, the general government fiscal deficit could gradually decrease to 6.8 per cent of GDP from 7.8 per cent in FY25.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tS&amp;P also said the upgrade trigger for its sovereign ratings rests on a meaningful narrowing of India’s fiscal deficits, such that the net change in its general government debt falls below 7 per cent of GDP on a structural basis. “But a lower debt-to-GDP ratio for India would not necessarily lead to an improved debt burden score. This is due to the country’s very high ratio of government interest servicing to revenue,” S&amp;P said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNoting that fiscal deficit projections seemed realistic, Fitch Ratings said there was a risk of modest slippage in revenue collection targets amid a recent moderation in economic growth. “We expect government capex to remain relatively high, but overall, the fiscal deficit reduction is likely to be slightly contractionary,” Fitch Ratings said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHighlighting that the Budget promotes private and state investments in infrastructure and energy transition, Moody's Ratings said the boost to spending due to rising disposable income would benefit makers of two-wheelers, passenger vehicles and white goods, and ride-hailing service providers.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The latest budget signals a slowing pace of fiscal consolidation, as the government seeks to provide firmer support for economic growth amid a dampened macroeconomic backdrop compared to recent years. Still, we expect the government is within reach of its near-term deficit target of 4.5 per cent by FY26,” Moody’s Ratings said.</div></div>",

It noted that tax measures will bolster middle-class spending power and consumption.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFitch Ratings said the Budget would be broadly neutral for growth and continued to project real GDP expansion of 6.4 per cent in FY25 and 6.5 per cent in FY26. Tax cuts, Fitch Ratings said, may provide a modest consumption boost.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tS&amp;P said the slower growth in capital investments for FY26 does not suggest a deterioration in the quality of government spending. “India’s Union Budget remains in line with our expectation of gradual fiscal consolidation… We believe bottlenecks in executing infrastructure projects will ease as supply chain pressures lessen and general elections are over,” S&amp;P Global Ratings said in a press statement.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tS&amp;P said the Budget allocation for capital expenditure is 3.1 per cent of GDP, unchanged from last financial year and is an increase of 10 per cent year-on-year in absolute terms.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe central government has lowered its fiscal deficit estimate for FY25 to 4.8 per cent of GDP from 4.9 per cent while budgeting a fiscal deficit of 4.4 per cent of GDP for FY26.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tS&amp;P has projected that, combined with central government deficits that may trend down to 4.2 per cent of GDP by FY28, the general government fiscal deficit could gradually decrease to 6.8 per cent of GDP from 7.8 per cent in FY25.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tS&amp;P also said the upgrade trigger for its sovereign ratings rests on a meaningful narrowing of India’s fiscal deficits, such that the net change in its general government debt falls below 7 per cent of GDP on a structural basis. “But a lower debt-to-GDP ratio for India would not necessarily lead to an improved debt burden score. This is due to the country’s very high ratio of government interest servicing to revenue,” S&amp;P said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNoting that fiscal deficit projections seemed realistic, Fitch Ratings said there was a risk of modest slippage in revenue collection targets amid a recent moderation in economic growth. “We expect government capex to remain relatively high, but overall, the fiscal deficit reduction is likely to be slightly contractionary,” Fitch Ratings said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHighlighting that the Budget promotes private and state investments in infrastructure and energy transition, Moody's Ratings said the boost to spending due to rising disposable income would benefit makers of two-wheelers, passenger vehicles and white goods, and ride-hailing service providers.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The latest budget signals a slowing pace of fiscal consolidation, as the government seeks to provide firmer support for economic growth amid a dampened macroeconomic backdrop compared to recent years. Still, we expect the government is within reach of its near-term deficit target of 4.5 per cent by FY26,” Moody’s Ratings said.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tThe gold loan portfolio of banks rose by 71.3 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) till December 2024 to Rs 1.72 trillion, compared to 17 per cent growth a year ago, on the back of rising gold prices and a slowdown in unsecured loans following an increase in risk weights last year.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Over the last year, gold loan growth has sharply increased, with a 68 per cent rise from March 2024 to December 2024 (9M FY25), while gold prices increased by around 21 per cent during this time,” said Ajit Velonie, senior director, Crisil Ratings.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“There has also been a partial slowdown in unsecured loan growth due to stricter regulations. The growth in gold loans has coincided with this period. Personal loans grew by only 5–6 per cent, compared to 16.5 per cent the previous year. The slower growth in unsecured loans has likely led borrowers to turn to gold loans as an alternative, though the impact is smaller compared to the overall slower growth in personal loans,” Velonie added.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn November 2023, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) increased risk weights for unsecured loans by 24 percentage points to 125 per cent. There has been a significant slowdown in the unsecured loan segment due to the tightening of norms.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe other personal loans segment, comprising unsecured credit, showed 9.7 per cent Y-o-Y growth in December 2024, compared to 20.8 per cent in December 2023. Credit card loans also saw a moderation in growth, at 15.6 per cent in December 2024, down from 32.6 per cent a year ago.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBank credit growth in the retail loan segment, including housing, vehicle, credit card, and personal loans, dropped to 14.9 per cent Y-o-Y in December 2024, down from 17.6 per cent in December 2023.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGold loan prices increased by 20.4 per cent to Rs 75,857 per 10 grams in December 2024, from Rs 62,993 per 10 grams in the year-ago period.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Factors contributing to the rise in gold loans include rising gold prices, as the value of loans taken against jewellery also increases amid the rise in gold prices. People with gold jewellery are also borrowing more, refinancing their loans as the value of gold increases,” said Kirti Timmanagoudar, head of strategy and co-lending, IIFL Finance.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The crackdown on unsecured lending and stress in the microfinance institution (MFI) space might also be contributing factors. It is likely a cumulative effect of these elements rather than one factor being responsible,” Timmanagoudar added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to RBI data, since May 2024, one bank has changed the classification of a category of agricultural loans into \"Loans against gold jewellery\" under the retail segment. The lender has stopped extending loans against gold in metropolitan branches for agricultural purposes and has placed them under retail loans.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Loans previously classified as agricultural are now being treated as gold loans. This reclassification might explain the slower growth in agricultural loans, which have only grown by 8 per cent compared to previous years,” Timmanagoudar said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGold loan financiers said gold loans have emerged as a preferred option for customers' short-term requirements.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The slowdown in the supply of unsecured lending might give an impetus, but gold loans have been witnessing an upward trajectory due to their own features. Today, they are widely accepted and a popular choice among customers, especially for short-term requirements, acting as a vital financial inclusion tool,” said Shaji Varghese, chief executive officer, Muthoot FinCorp.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe December edition of the financial stability report (FSR) of the RBI observed a rapid increase in gold loan disbursals during the period ending September 2024 compared to the same period last year.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo address the non-adherence to prudential guidelines by supervised entities (SEs) in granting loans against the pledge of gold ornaments and jewellery, the RBI has advised SEs to comprehensively review their policies, identify gaps, and implement corrective measures within a specified timeframe.</div></div>",
