However, Congress Lok Sabha member Shashi Tharoor, who heads the parliamentary standing committee on external affairs, said the US was entitled to send illegal immigrants back, but his only problem with the deportation was that they were sent back in a military aircraft.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Tharoor-led committee held a meeting on Tuesday where the issue of deportation was discussed. Later in a series of posts on X, he pointed out that there were 725,000 undocumented Indian immigrants in the US, the third-largest group after Mexico and El Salvador. \"Since October 2020, US Customs and Border Protection officials have detained nearly 170,000 Indian migrants attempting to cross the border illegally from either Canada or Mexico.
