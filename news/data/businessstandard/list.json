However, Delhi is expected to be the frontrunner by 2030, followed by Pune, as Bengaluru and Chennai show steady momentum, reflecting robust long-term diversity strategies.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOverall, GCCs are expected to add a million people to their current workforce by 2030, taking the total number to 3.3 million and closing the gap with IT services companies.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Over the last three years, India has also witnessed the emergence of new GCC hubs, and GCCs are fast outpacing IT services in job creation. The recent introduction of the national framework in the FY26 budget will further propel GCC growth across Tier-II and Tier-III locations, and the demand for niche skills will continue to rise,\" added Alug.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe report also said that Bengaluru, with hiring growth expected at 27 per cent, remains the hub for the IT and R&amp;D ecosystem, driven by rising demand for AI, data science, and cloud computing.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMumbai follows with 23 per cent, Chennai at 19 per cent, Hyderabad at 11 per cent, and Pune and Delhi at 10 per cent each.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGCCs are expected to be top players in Hyderabad (19 per cent) and Mumbai (19 per cent), particularly in IT software &amp; consulting and BFSI.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDelhi/NCR (21 per cent) and Bengaluru (24 per cent) will also remain competitive, especially in telecom &amp; internet services.</div></div>",

Swiggy’s consolidated total income also went up 30.8 per cent to Rs 4,095.8 crore in Q3FY25, compared to Rs 3,130.9 crore reported in Q3FY24.</div></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe firm told the regulator that it expects to achieve “positive adjusted Ebitda by the third quarter of FY26.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tWhen asked about the reasons for widening of the net loss, Swiggy chief financial officer (CFO) Rahul Bothra, attributed it to adjusted Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation), which is a combination of food delivery and investments in quick commerce. ESOP charges also played a role.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“Adjusted Ebitda has gone up by Rs 149 crore in the quarter. There is a depreciation increase as a result of the capex that we have spent on both warehousing as well as dark store infrastructure,” said Bothra.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tRegarding Swiggy’s path to profitability and strategies related to that, Bothra said that in the previous quarter, Swiggy had guided for adjusted Ebitda of break even at the corporate level by October-December quarter in 2025. He said the company is committed to that guidance and this would be driven as a result of the food delivery Ebitda margin, where the firm is witnessing a strong growth.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“As a result of food delivery, increasing its cash flow profile and quick commerce getting contribution break-even in the quarter that I mentioned, we believe that we can achieve adjusted profitability,” said Bothra.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tSwiggy’s gross order value (GOV) grew 38 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 12,165 crore. The company said the consolidated adjusted (Ebitda) loss reduced by 2 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 490 crore but rose Rs 149 crore quarter-on-quarter (Q-o-Q).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe platform’s Average MTU (monthly transacting users) increased 25.3 per cent Y-o-Y to reach 17.8 million, with nearly a third of all users utilising more than one service on the platform.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“We delivered higher Y-o-Y growth across all three of our primary businesses during Q3, which accelerated B2C GOV growth to 38 per cent Y-o-Y,” said Sriharsha Majety, MD and Group CEO, Swiggy.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“The secular expansion in food delivery margins and cash flow generation is balanced by growth investments being made in quick-commerce including dark-stores expansion and marketing, amidst high competitive intensity in the near term. With this thrust, Instamart added another 86 stores in January 2025, and has grown MTUs to 9 million (+2 million),” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe company continued the focus on creating segmented offerings for the consumer during the festive quarter, which the company believes will open up more consumption occasions.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIn terms of innovations and technology investments, Rohit Kapoor, CEO Food Marketplace, Swiggy said in recent months, the company introduced Bolt and Snacc (10-minute food delivery), and expanded into new categories within Quick-Commerce.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“Bolt has been scaled up to 425 cities, already accounts for 9 per cent of overall food deliveries,” said Kapoor, adding, “While we are innovating, we’re also learning how to innovate without investing additional dollars into the food business.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe company also launched Swiggy Scenes focused on restaurant event reservations, and introduced One BLCK, the premium tier of Swiggy One subscription program.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tSwiggy’s food delivery business’ gross order value (GOV) grew 19.2 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 7,436 crore. Adjusted Ebitda grew 63.7 per cent Q-o-Q to Rs 184 crore, delivering a 2.5 per cent margin, up from 0.3 per cent a year ago. The segment also added 2.4 million MTUs over the past year, driven by multiple industry-leading innovations.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tSwiggy Instamart reported an 88 per cent Y-o-Y (15.5 per cent Q-o-Q) rise in GOV to Rs 3,907 crore. Average order value increased by 14 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 534 driven by greater selection and increased consumer salience.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tInstamart added 96 new active stores during the quarter (+16 per cent Q-o-Q); driving up active darkstore area to 2.45 million sq ft (+25 per cent Q-o-Q). Growth investments in quick-commerce led to a reduction in contribution margin from -1.9 per cent in Q2FY25 to -4.6 per cent in Q3FY25, as the company ramped up user activation and dark-store expansion across geographies. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

But I wonder if we are all going to like this.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tOn that occasion in the first leg, referee Stuart Attwell used the public address system to announce via a wireless microphone that the goal scored by Tottenham striker Dominic Solanke in the 76th minute had been ruled out for offside. Attwell spoke after a VAR review lasting around two minutes.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTottenham manager Ange Postecoglou wasn't impressed with the historic moment at the time, saying: If people think that announcement tonight added anything to the game, I'm sorry. I mean, really, just get on with it.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tSlot was more concerned that the officials chose to make an announcement about what he described as an obvious decision rather than on a more contentious call, when Tottenham midfielder Lucas Bergvall avoided getting a second yellow card for a foul on Kostas Tsimikas.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhile Tsimikas was off the field, waiting to come back on having received treatment, Bergvall scored the only goal of the game.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI think the one we were more interested in was why he didn't give the second yellow card and that is something he didn't have to explain, Slot said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSemi-automated offside technology might come into the Premier League even earlier before the end of this season.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tInitially, the technology was supposed to be brought in after one of the international breaks in the first half of this season but was delayed because of issues in the testing process. Scholes said progress had been made in recent weeks.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe believe it to be the most accurate and the most future-proof system as well, Scholes said. I have to confess, given the difficulties that we had over the first few months of the season, I had severe doubts about this, but the progress made over the last four to six weeks has been significant.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tScholes said introducing the technology with potentially only a handful of games to go would not create an integrity issue.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLeague officials have said they hope it will reduce the time it takes to check for offside by an average of 31 seconds.</p><p></p></div>",

These AI innovations are set to improve the overall digital learning experience, making high-quality education personalised, accessible, affordable, and scalable for learners worldwide.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We were the first globally to introduce online mentored learning in 2017—combining the flexibility of self-learning with the power of expert human guidance to drive real outcomes at scale,” said Mohan Lakhamraju, founder and chief executive officer (CEO), Great Learning.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“However, great teachers are few, and most learners never get to experience the magic of learning from them. This is what we are trying to solve using AI. As AI advances further, we will continue to push boundaries, making high-quality education more accessible, affordable, and impactful for learners everywhere.”</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWith the AI Mentor, every learner gets their own personal learning coach to support them through their learning journey at every step. It delivers an uninterrupted learning experience with 24/7 doubt resolution and step-by-step guidance while working on projects.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIf a learner gets stuck while coding, the AI Mentor provides real-time coding support, dropping intelligent hints to nudge them towards the correct solution without revealing the answer directly. It also makes them job-ready through AI-driven mock interviews, simulating real-world job interview scenarios.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSince its rollout across select cohorts of learners over the past few months, the company said the AI Mentor has made a significant impact. This includes:</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t- Over 400,000 coding hints generated </div>\n<div>\r\n\t- 130,000 learner queries resolved </div>\n<div>\r\n\t- Over 300 mock interviews conducted.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe AI Teacher customises lessons based on learners' context and evaluates their understanding. It identifies knowledge gaps and provides valuable feedback on their progress—just like a human teacher would.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis is in addition to the guidance and mentorship from industry experts and faculty that learners already have access to as part of Great Learning’s ‘Mentored Learning’ model.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe company also announced that all its AI-powered learning enablements will come under the umbrella brand ‘Glaide’—a combination of ‘GL’ (Great Learning), ‘AI’, and ‘aide’.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOver the coming months and years, Great Learning will roll out its AI-powered learning experiences to newer and larger audiences.</div></div>",
