TAFE has been using the brand uninterruptedly since 1960 in India,\" the statement said.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAGCO, in its response, said:</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"We are in the process of considering the terms of the order and will take appropriate legal measures to dispute it, including by way of appeal. As proud owners, we are committed to preserving the Massey Ferguson legacy and safeguarding intellectual property.\"</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAGCO also emphasised that:</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"Protecting trademarks and copyrights is essential for fostering innovation, attracting investment into India, and setting industry standards globally. India’s agricultural future is key to AGCO’s mission, and we are dedicated to providing farmers with straightforward, dependable, and high-quality equipment to drive their productivity. In line with our Farmer-First strategy, Massey Ferguson will always prioritise Indian farmers.\"</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAGCO further questioned TAFE’s position, stating:</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"We maintain that TAFE's conflicting claims—asserting both licensee and ownership rights over the Massey Ferguson trademarks—are mutually contradictory, as they cannot hold both positions simultaneously.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"For more than 50 years, TAFE has signed multiple agreements with AGCO and Massey Ferguson, recognising itself as a trademark licensee of the Massey Ferguson brand in India. It is important to note that AGCO has received multiple favourable rulings to date, successfully defending against TAFE's claims on jurisdiction, contempt of court, supply arrangements, and brand ownership, including at the Supreme Court level,\" AGCO stated.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBackground to the Dispute<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIn April 2024, AGCO terminated its agreements with TAFE, including the brand licence for Massey Ferguson, which triggered a legal battle.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn November 19, both TAFE and AGCO claimed that the Madras High Court had ruled in their favour, citing an order to maintain \"status quo\", leading to confusion regarding the actual ruling.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Massey Ferguson brand has a long history in India, dating back to the 1960s, when Chennai-based Amalgamations Group decided to manufacture these tractors in India. TAFE was founded in 1960 as a joint venture between Massey Ferguson (part of the AGCO Group) and Amalgamations.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn 1974, the two companies entered into a trademark agreement, which was later expanded in 1994, granting TAFE the exclusive right to use the Massey Ferguson (MF) brand name for its tractor operations in India.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tInterestingly, TAFE is the single largest shareholder in AGCO, which is the third-largest farm equipment manufacturer in the world, after Deere &amp; Company and CNH Industrial. On the other hand, AGCO holds a 21 per cent stake in TAFE.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tImpact of the Dispute<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe public spat escalated further after TAFE filed a contempt petition against AGCO, following the US company’s termination of its agreements with TAFE.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Massey Ferguson brand is crucial for TAFE, as out of its total annual production of over 180,000 tractors, over 100,000 bear the Massey Ferguson name.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSince its inception in 1960, TAFE has produced, built, and nurtured the Massey Ferguson brand in India, with over 3 million customers to date.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to TAFE, its products are India-centric in design, distinctly different from AGCO’s products, and ideally suited for small and medium farmers in India and across the world.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTAFE further pointed out that:</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"AGCO’s global brand website has made no mention of the Massey Ferguson brand in the context of India, Nepal, and Bhutan for six decades, having ceded the entire territory to TAFE since the takeover of Massey Ferguson India in 1960.\"</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

It also forecast a modest decline in Disney+ subscribers in the second quarter compared to the first.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tDisney+ and Hulu produced an operating profit of $293 million, marking the third straight quarter of profitability and a turnaround from the year-ago loss of $138 million.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tDisney said its addition of ESPN to Disney+ has encouraged subscribers to sample sports programming, increasing time spent on the app, a trend it hopes to capitalize on with the addition of a daily \"SportsCenter\" studio show called \"SC+\" this year. All of this sets the stage for the launch of its flagship ESPN offering within the app this fall.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIn the Experiences segment, which includes consumer products and the cruise line, as well as parks, operating income was roughly flat at $3.1 billion.

TAFE has been using the brand uninterruptedly since 1960 in India,\" the statement said.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAGCO, in its response, said:</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"We are in the process of considering the terms of the order and will take appropriate legal measures to dispute it, including by way of appeal. As proud owners, we are committed to preserving the Massey Ferguson legacy and safeguarding intellectual property.\"</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAGCO also emphasised that:</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"Protecting trademarks and copyrights is essential for fostering innovation, attracting investment into India, and setting industry standards globally. India’s agricultural future is key to AGCO’s mission, and we are dedicated to providing farmers with straightforward, dependable, and high-quality equipment to drive their productivity. In line with our Farmer-First strategy, Massey Ferguson will always prioritise Indian farmers.\"</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAGCO further questioned TAFE’s position, stating:</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"We maintain that TAFE's conflicting claims—asserting both licensee and ownership rights over the Massey Ferguson trademarks—are mutually contradictory, as they cannot hold both positions simultaneously.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"For more than 50 years, TAFE has signed multiple agreements with AGCO and Massey Ferguson, recognising itself as a trademark licensee of the Massey Ferguson brand in India. It is important to note that AGCO has received multiple favourable rulings to date, successfully defending against TAFE's claims on jurisdiction, contempt of court, supply arrangements, and brand ownership, including at the Supreme Court level,\" AGCO stated.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBackground to the Dispute<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIn April 2024, AGCO terminated its agreements with TAFE, including the brand licence for Massey Ferguson, which triggered a legal battle.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn November 19, both TAFE and AGCO claimed that the Madras High Court had ruled in their favour, citing an order to maintain \"status quo\", leading to confusion regarding the actual ruling.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Massey Ferguson brand has a long history in India, dating back to the 1960s, when Chennai-based Amalgamations Group decided to manufacture these tractors in India. TAFE was founded in 1960 as a joint venture between Massey Ferguson (part of the AGCO Group) and Amalgamations.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn 1974, the two companies entered into a trademark agreement, which was later expanded in 1994, granting TAFE the exclusive right to use the Massey Ferguson (MF) brand name for its tractor operations in India.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tInterestingly, TAFE is the single largest shareholder in AGCO, which is the third-largest farm equipment manufacturer in the world, after Deere &amp; Company and CNH Industrial. On the other hand, AGCO holds a 21 per cent stake in TAFE.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tImpact of the Dispute<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe public spat escalated further after TAFE filed a contempt petition against AGCO, following the US company’s termination of its agreements with TAFE.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Massey Ferguson brand is crucial for TAFE, as out of its total annual production of over 180,000 tractors, over 100,000 bear the Massey Ferguson name.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSince its inception in 1960, TAFE has produced, built, and nurtured the Massey Ferguson brand in India, with over 3 million customers to date.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to TAFE, its products are India-centric in design, distinctly different from AGCO’s products, and ideally suited for small and medium farmers in India and across the world.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTAFE further pointed out that:</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"AGCO’s global brand website has made no mention of the Massey Ferguson brand in the context of India, Nepal, and Bhutan for six decades, having ceded the entire territory to TAFE since the takeover of Massey Ferguson India in 1960.\"</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
