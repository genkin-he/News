A US military C-17 aircraft had departed for India with migrants aboard but would not arrive for at least 24 hours, the report quoted an official as saying.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tUS President Donald Trump has increasingly turned to the military to help carry out his immigration agenda, including sending additional troops to the US-Mexico border, using military aircraft to deport migrants and opening military bases to house them.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrump has consistently advocated for the removal of illegal immigrants from the United States, citing concerns over national security, economic impact, and the rule of law.

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\n<strong>By Josh Wingrove and Jenny Leonard</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tPresident Donald Trump pledged hundreds of billions in tariffs to remake the global economy and target even his closest neighbours.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tBut so far, it’s been more Art of the Deal than a revolution.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrump on Monday shelved plans for wide-ranging tariffs on Canada and Mexico, after doing the same for Colombia the prior week. In each case, Trump relented despite countries promising only modest changes on border security and immigration.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrump and his allies have held up those concessions as vindication of his approach. But the US president’s willingness - at least for now - to hold off tariffs has underscored doubts over whether Trump, who famously obsesses over market performance, might once again prove a paper tiger on his more fiery trade threats. </div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrump could always reverse course again and press for more extreme measures, or impose the tariffs in a bid to offset the projected cost of some of his domestic agenda. </div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBut the deferrals are only likely to feed the US president’s growing reputation for stopping short of his bombast when it comes to trade, using the levies as a negotiating ploy. Even after Trump announced he was pushing ahead with his tariffs over the weekend, the slide in markets was contained as analysts predicted concessions that would limit their impact.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tStill, uncertainty swirls: Trump did not announce a pause on China tariffs, which have more support in his party, ahead of a planned phone call with President Xi Jinping later this week. He’s also pledged levies on the EU and key sectors. And Trump emphasised that the Mexican and Canadian pauses are only for a month, raising the prospect he could snap back the levies if he doesn’t see the outcomes he wants.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnd Trump’s moves, even if not fully implemented, have come with costs. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrump’s threats and the prospect of them becoming real dropped US stocks and the currencies of his targets, including the Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, euro, and South African rand. Each of those recovered as Trump delayed his Mexican threat, then his Canadian one. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile in world capitals, leaders are taking stock of how to respond to the White House. Much of Canada’s Liberal Party leadership campaign to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has centered on how to take on Trump. And internationally minded businesses across the closest of US allies have been forced for weeks into reviewing their own supply chains.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Familiar concessions</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIt all leaves unclear whether Trump is all bark on tariffs or whether he still aims to shift the US back toward an era a century ago when import levies were the chief source of revenue.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrump said he’d take part in ongoing talks toward a deal with Mexico, and conditioned a further Canada reprieve on whether they can reach a “final economic deal.” And he’s still threatening a host of other tariffs, including on the EU.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAllies of the president touted the concessions from Mexico — a deployment of 10,000 National Guard members to prevent drug trafficking and further talks on security and trade — as proof of Trump’s negotiating prowess. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBut they struck a familiar tone. Mexico agreed to dispatch 10,000 troops to its own southern border under President Joe Biden’s administration in 2021, and also dispatched several thousand troops to its southern border in 2019 amid similar pressure from Trump over migration. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCanada made a similar announcement — saying that “nearly 10,000 frontline personnel are and will be working on protecting the border” and pledging a handful of new measures, like C$200 million to fight organised crime and naming a fentanyl czar. Trump also praised a C$1.3 billion announcement Trudeau has previously made.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrudeau’s government scrambled to put together a border plan two months ago, after Trump first threatened tariffs over migration and fentanyl flows. Officials also repeatedly pointed out there is no evidence the border is a significant problem on these issues.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBut as time passed with no deal, Canadian officials grew frustrated at the lack of information about what Trump was looking for, and raised doubts that fentanyl was his true motivation.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We’ve shown them and said that we’ll do what’s necessary to deal with this,” said Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc in a television interview Sunday. “But I wonder if that’s the actual pretext, or if there’s another policy objective that they’re pursuing.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Mexico about-face is virtually identical to Trump’s move in his first term, when he declared a national economic emergency and announced tariffs would go into effect in 2019 — and increase 5 per cent every month until Mexico take actions to address the illegal migration crisis.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe standoff between Trump and his Mexican counterpart took about a week until the president on June 7, 2019, announced in a social media post that he had “reached a signed agreement with Mexico” and tariffs scheduled to be implemented were “indefinitely suspended.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Just like in 2019, Mexico came to the table in advance of those tariffs going into effect with commitments that sufficiently addressed the president’s concerns,” said Kelly Ann Shaw, a partner at Hogan Lovells who served as Trump’s deputy economic council director during his first term.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt also mirrors his move last month to threaten tariffs on Colombia in a dispute over deportation flights, only to back off when the Latin American nation’s leader said he would pick up migrants with his own government plane rather than have them fly shackled on US military planes.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrump’s Saturday announcement that he would press ahead with 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, two of the largest US trading partners, shook markets. Equities slumped while oil rose and the US dollar strengthened amid fears the duties would kick off a wider trade war. Canada and Mexico each threatened retaliatory measures if Trump followed through. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrump has threatened a range of other tariffs, though it’s not clear which, if any, he actually intends to implement. Those include duties on sectors like pharmaceuticals, chips, steel, aluminum, and copper; tariffs on the European Union; and a potential across-the-board global tariff that Trump has said should be “much bigger” than 2.5 per cent.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe president has long spoke about his desire to use tariffs more aggressively to fill government coffers, as he looks to cut taxes elsewhere, and get even with countries he perceives as ripping off the US. His decision to pause the Canada and Mexico tariffs leaves those goals unfulfilled for now.</div></div>",

However, there's an important consideration: NRIs can benefit from tax treaties (also known as Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements or DTAA) that India has signed with other countries.

Under such treaties, the tax rate on capital gains or mutual fund income may be reduced to a lower rate, depending on the specific agreement between India and the NRI's home country.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tExample: If an NRI investor earns Rs 1,00,000 from a mutual fund, the default tax deduction would be 20% (Rs 20,000), but if there is a tax treaty between India and the NRI's country, the withholding rate could be lower.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Income tax rates</strong></div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\n<strong>For Individuals, Hindu Undivided Family, Association of Persons, Body of Individuals and Artificial juridical persons</strong></div>\n<div>\n<div style=\"float:left\">\n<span class=\"fixed-height-container\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box;display:block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0\"><img alt=\"incomelegeld\" class=\"zoomimg\" data-nimg=\"fill\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;background-size:cover;background-position:0% 0%;filter:blur(20px);background-image:url(\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNk0AAAAC4AKhMfIC0AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\")'/><noscript><img alt=\"incomelegeld\" class=\"zoomimg\" data-nimg=\"fill\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2025-02/04/full/1738637717-6422.png\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%\"/></noscript></span></span></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Source: Tata MF<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\t\tSecurities Transaction Tax (STT)</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div style=\"float:left\">\n<span class=\"fixed-height-container\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box;display:block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0\"><img alt=\"sttdk\" class=\"zoomimg\" data-nimg=\"fill\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;background-size:cover;background-position:0% 0%;filter:blur(20px);background-image:url(\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNk0AAAAC4AKhMfIC0AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\")'/><noscript><img alt=\"sttdk\" class=\"zoomimg\" data-nimg=\"fill\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2025-02/04/full/1738637815-736.png\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%\"/></noscript></span></span></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<strong>Capital Gains:</strong></div>\n<div style=\"float:left\">\n<span class=\"fixed-height-container\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box;display:block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0\"><img alt=\"gainsfdld\" class=\"zoomimg\" data-nimg=\"fill\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;background-size:cover;background-position:0% 0%;filter:blur(20px);background-image:url(\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNk0AAAAC4AKhMfIC0AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\")'/><noscript><img alt=\"gainsfdld\" class=\"zoomimg\" data-nimg=\"fill\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2025-02/04/full/1738637859-7194.png?im=Resize=(640,480)\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%\"/></noscript></span></span></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
