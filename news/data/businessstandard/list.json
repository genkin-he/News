Rest of world (RoW) reported 6 per cent YoY growth to Rs 167 crore, while the domestic business de-grew 26 per cent YoY to Rs 56 crore.

The Cenexi business was also impacted by unforeseen events, however the postponement of positive margins (Ebitda) to Q3FY26 is a matter of slight concern. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThat said, the brokerage firm expects normalcy to return in a quarter or two.

The new CEO has been assigned to take charge of RoW and India businesses, ICICI Securities said in a note.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnalysts at InCred Equities said they are disappointed with the repeated delay in Cenexi’s turnaround and will reassess the situation constructively once the facility is back on track.

However, by the end of Monday, Trump took a U-turn to delay the tariffs by 30 days. WTI contract had opened up 3.6 per cent in Asian trade but, by late trading in New York, was briefly down on the day before a modest bounce into the close to be up 0.5 per cent. </div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tTrumps tariffs on Crude oil &amp; products</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMexico accounts for about 11 per cent of America’s total petroleum exports, while it accounts for about 11 per cent of total crude oil imports into the United States. On the other hand, Canada exports 4.1 million barrels per day of petroleum products to the US and accounts for more than half of America’s total petroleum imports on a yearly basis. Hence, taxing these two countries would feel a direct pinch to the US consumers with in a week.

The Jan ISM manufacturing index rose 1.7 to 50.9, stronger-than-expectations of 50.0 and the highest level in 2-1/3 years.  Also, December construction spending rose 0.5 per cent month-on-month, stronger than expectations of 0.2 per cent M-o-M. But China’s private factory activities in January showed some concern as index fell to 50.1 from 50.5. Demand concerns remain pertinent as China's 2024 crude imports fell 1.9 per cent Y-o-Y to 553 MMT. China is the world's biggest crude importer, and the tariffs could decelerate its GDP by 0.5-0.9 per cent, which could dent it crude demand significantly. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tOPEC+ JMCC</h3>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOPEC+ held its Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) meeting yesterday, and, as widely expected, the group recommended no change to its output policy. This suggests that the group is likely to go ahead with the unwinding of their additional voluntary supply cuts from April. The group is scheduled to bring back around 2.2 million barrels per day of supply over an 18-month period starting in April. Obviously, the return of this supply will still be dependent on market conditions. The next JMMC meeting will be held on April 5.
