No Waqf property will be left, nothing will be left,\" the AIMIM chief said during his address in the Lok Sabha.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"You want to make India 'Viksit Bharat', we want 'Viksit Bharat'.

I will not allow that. We will no more come and give a diplomatic talk over here. This is the House where I have to stand and speak honestly, that my community - we are proud Indians. It is my property, not given by anyone. You cannot snatch it away from me. Waqf is a form of worship for me.</p><p></p></div>",
