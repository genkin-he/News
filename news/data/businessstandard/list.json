However, due to marginal relief, he pays only Rs 25,000, plus a 4% cess, making his final tax Rs 26,000.

It stimulates the body to produce more of the natural hormone erythropoietin, or EPO, which has long been a doping product favored by cyclists and distance runners to boost stamina.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHalep initially was given a four-year ban that would have expired in 2026. But she appealed, and the Court of Arbitration for Sport reduced the penalty to nine months in March 2024.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tShe argued that she was exposed to a contaminated supplement that caused her failed test. CAS determined that Halep bore some level of fault or negligence for not exercising sufficient care while using the supplement, but she bore no significant fault or negligence. So that is why, CAS said, her anti-doping rule violations were not intentional.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHalep made her return to the tour later that month at the Miami Open but has played a total of only six matches since then.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tShe leaves the sport with 24 singles titles and more than $40 million in prize money.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTo be competitive again requires much more, and at this moment, it's no longer possible, Halep said Tuesday.

This has become possible due to revised tax slabs and an enhanced rebate of Rs 60,000 under section 87A. However, ever since the announcement of revised tax slabs and rates under the new tax regime for FY 2025-26, there has been a lot of confusion about tax on incomes slightly above Rs 12 lakh. For example, what happens when a person is earning Rs 12.1 lakh or Rs 12.5 lakh?</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIf your salary is a little over Rs 12 lakh, say Rs 12.10 lakh, you might expect to pay Rs 61,500 in income tax.  However, due to marginal relief, you won’t pay the full tax. This relief ensures that your total tax liability doesn’t exceed the tax you would have paid if your income were exactly Rs 12 lakh. So, while your tax on Rs 12.10 lakh would normally be Rs 61,500, marginal relief reduces it to Rs 25,000 (plus cess), saving you a significant amount in tax.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has cleared the doubts, saying the total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs 12,75,000.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What is marginal tax relief?</strong></div>\n<div>\r\n\tMarginal tax relief is the relief provided by the income tax department when a person's income is marginally above the tax-free limit.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"Marginal relief is a provision that grants relief to a taxpayer whose income may have just exceeded the threshold of a higher tax bracket so that he / she does not have to pay a tax higher than the additional income. While income up to Rs 12.75 lakh will be tax-free in the hands of salaried individuals by virtue of the slab rates and rebate along with the standard deduction of Rs 75,000, for non-salaried individuals, the benefit of a standard deduction will be available in the form of marginal relief making income up to Rs 12.75 lakh tax-free for the non-salaried individuals as well.

For Rs 12.1 lakh, the excess income is Rs 10,000. The relief is calculated by subtracting Rs 10,000 from the total tax liability, reducing the tax payable to just Rs 10,0<strong>00.</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Marginal relief is available to resident individuals whose income exceeds Rs 12 lakh but does not exceed Rs 12.75 lak</strong>h.

Although his income exceeds Rs 12 lakh, he’s not eligible for a rebate under Section 87A. Without marginal relief, his tax liability would be Rs 63,750. However, due to marginal relief, he pays only Rs 25,000, plus a 4% cess, making his final tax Rs 26,000. Marginal relief applies up to Rs 12.75 lakh, after which full tax is due according to the new tax slabs.</div></div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

Operating profit (Ebitda) plunged 20.4 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 1,636.7 crore, as against Rs 2,056.1 crore in Q3FY24.

We registered a 6.6 per cent decline in overall coatings business in India, including Industrial. The domestic decorative business delivered a 1.6 per cent volume growth, but standalone revenues declined 7.5 per cent, impacted by weak festive season demand.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSyngle also noted that while the company saw sequential improvements in operating margins, the adverse product mix, coupled with higher sales and distribution expenses, affected profitability compared to the previous year.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, not all was bleak. The company’s Industrial Business showed strength, posting a 3.8 per cent Y-o-Y revenue growth, boosted by strong performances in the General Industrial and Refinish segments. Additionally, Asian Paints saw continued expansion in its Home Décor business, along with a 5 per cent growth in its international portfolio, which surged 17.1 per cent in constant currency (CC) terms, driven by robust performance in the Middle East and a recovery in key Asian markets.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDespite these positive indicators, Asian Paints remains cautious. Syngle added, “In the near term, we remain cautiously optimistic on a recovery in demand conditions while we continue to invest in our brand and focus on innovation and customer centricity.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe muted results by Asian Paints have led analysts to raise concerns about the company’s near-term outlook. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tICICI Securities predicts that Asian Paints will face subdued growth in CY25, despite a favourable base in Q4FY25. They expect the stress in urban markets, which has resulted in downtrading, to persist, hurting profitability. Furthermore, the competitive landscape is expected to intensify majorly by H1FY26 as Grasim expands its plants and distribution network, pressuring Asian Paints to prioritise market share over margins. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAdditionally, rising commodity prices and the depreciation of the rupee add further challenges, analysts noted. Thus, ICICI Securities has reduced its FY25-26 earnings estimates by 3 per cent, maintaining a ‘Reduce’ rating. The brokerage has also revised the target price to Rs 2,200.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile, Nuvama has set a revised target price of Rs 3,000 (down from Rs 3,185) while maintaining a ‘Buy’ rating. Despite Q3FY25 results falling below expectations, with a 6.1 per cent decline in revenue and a 20.4 per cent drop in Ebitda, Nuvama highlights growth in the international business and the industrial sector as positives. They’ve also lowered their earnings per share (EPS) estimates for FY25-27 due to a weak demand outlook.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tInCred Equities has set a target price of Rs 2,340 and maintained a ‘Reduce’ rating, citing weak sales. According to reports, Goldman Sachs, with a more cautious stance, has a Sell’ rating, lowering its target to Rs 2,275, primarily due to subdued demand and increasing competitive intensity in the market.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAmong other brokerages, Morgan Stanley reportedly maintained an ‘Underweight’ rating and lowered the target price to Rs 2,358 per share. Jefferies also maintained an ‘Underperform’ rating, setting a target price of Rs 2,000. CLSA shared a similar outlook with an ‘Underperform’ rating and a target price of Rs 2,047.
