The squad is almost identical to the one England fielded during the T20 series, with one big change, as Joe Root is set to make his ODI return in Nagpur for the first time since 2023.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tExcept for Root, the whole team remains the same, with Phil Salt keeping his position as the wicketkeeper and Adil Rashid being the sole regular spinner.

With 452 runs and a reputation for anchoring the middle order, Rahul emerged as one of India's most reliable performers. His calm presence at the crease has been a cornerstone of India's ODI setup, ensuring stability under pressure.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tYet, his game is not without its flaws. While he provides a solid foundation, his strike rotation in the middle overs remains a lingering concern. In modern ODI cricket, where acceleration is key, this could tilt the scales in favor of a more aggressive alternative.  </div><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEnter Rishabh Pant—the maverick left-hander who brings unpredictability, raw power, and an uncanny ability to turn matches on their head. In an Indian batting lineup heavily dominated by right-handers, Pant’s presence adds much-needed variety. His fearless stroke play and ability to clear the ropes with astonishing ease make him an undeniable X-factor. <small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/cricket/champions-trophy\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Check latest news on ICC Champions Trophy 2025 here</strong></a></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>A Dilemma That Could Cost Iyer?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndia’s team management could look to accommodate both Rahul and Pant, but that might come at the expense of Shreyas Iyer. Despite a lackluster showing in the Sri Lanka series, Iyer’s track record in ODIs and his consistency in the domestic circuit cannot be overlooked.
