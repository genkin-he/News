BlackRock is also inheriting a so-called global capabilities center with roughly 1,500 staff in Bangalore through its proposed purchase of data firm Preqin, said the people, who declined to be identified citing confidential information.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe new hires will bolster headcount in this area by about a third, adding to the roughly 3,500 staff in the Gurugram and Mumbai offices, the people said. BlackRock wants to build out its artificial intelligence team, and will hire engineers and data experts when the plans firm up, the people said. </div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tA spokesperson for the New York-based firm declined to comment on the hiring plans. </div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOnce an outpost for grunt back-office work, India has witnessed a rapid increase in global capability centers, where employees include engineers and lawyers for companies ranging from banks to pharmaceutical firms.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has invested in its GCCs in Bengaluru and Hyderabad that employ about 9,000 people, according to the firm’s website. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBlackRock’s iHubs work on value-added products and services ranging from investment research to risk management, financial engineering, business operations and data analytics, the people said. Several of these areas incorporate and leverage artificial intelligence, they added. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo accommodate more employees and support future growth, BlackRock has leased additional office space in the Mumbai suburb of Goregaon from developer Oberoi Realty Ltd. in a deal worth nearly 4 billion rupees ($45.9 million), the people said.
