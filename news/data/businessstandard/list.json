            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tFollowing the announcement of Budget 2025, smallcase Managers, Sebi registered research analysts and investment advisors have identified promising sectors for investment. The rise in capital expenditure (Capex) budget, projected to exceed $1.2 trillion by 2030, is set to benefit banks and infrastructure NBFCs. Additionally, sectors such as urban housing, insurance, and defense-related industries look favorable due to long-term policy support.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile consumption-driven companies are considered overvalued, consumer finance, electric vehicles (EVs), and tourism—particularly religious tourism—are emerging as compelling investment opportunities. Additionally, India’s growing IT market, fueled by AI advancements, presents substantial long-term growth potential.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Here are the key sectors selected for investment: </strong></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n\t\tCapex budget has risen 15% CAGR in the past 10 years, allocation until 2030 likely to exceed $1.2 trillion. Large capex investments likely to be beneficial for Banks and specialized infra NBFCs</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tConsumer finance companies available at a more reasonable valuation</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tEVs, Mobility, Tourism, and religious tourism provide interesting opportunities</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tDeepSeek has expanded the market for IT, but near-term growth rates and valuations a concern</li>\n</ul>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Capex budget</strong></div>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile the showstopper in this budget was the zero income tax for those incurring Rs 12 lakh of salary, there was a lot of capex and infrastructure allocation which was not in the limelight. From 2014-15 where capex was 20% of the total budget, it has increased to 31% this year. Capex budget has been growing at nearly 15% CAGR over the last 10 years compared to the revenue budget which has grown at around 10% CAGR.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Sectors in focus</strong></div>\n<div>\r\n\tSuch large capex investments are likely to be beneficial to Banks and specialized infrastructure NBFCs. Further, the focus on power sector “nudge” reforms, which encourage state discoms to focus on timely payments to generators, are likely to benefit the whole power ecosystem. Housing and Urbanization focus would benefit housing finance companies. Besides these, Defence, Railways, and Construction and Engineering and EPC companies would benefit to a large extent.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tArvind Kothari, smallcase Manager and Founder of Niveshaay highlighted power, transformers, and clean energy sectors are attractive investment opportunities, especially with the government’s continued focus on energy transition, infrastructure development, and sustainability. The Budget’s increased allocation towards renewable energy, grid modernization, and EV infrastructure is set to drive robust growth in these areas. He also pointed out PLI schemes have significantly accelerated the growth of textile companies by enhancing manufacturing capabilities and promoting exports. The Budget’s focus on boosting domestic production, coupled with favorable policies, is expected to further strengthen this sector.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Consumption sector is a big winner</strong></div>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile consumption is likely to benefit, most of the consumption companies are extremely overvalued. smallcase managers believe that consumer finance companies could be a way to play this at a more reasonable valuation. Also, EVs and other means of mobility could provide interesting opportunities. Another sector which could be interesting due to the tax benefits and the budget focus on the sector is Tourism, especially, religious tourism.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSonam Srivastava, smallcase Manager, and Founder of Wright Research said, “Retail consumption remains a theme for investment. Trent, Zomato and Dixon Tech are available at attractive valuations currently. We also have a bias towards defensives, capital market focused companies, pharma and hospitals. Electronic manufacturing, Banks and IT sectors also look interesting at the current juncture.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>DeepSeek and IT sector</strong></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIT remains an interesting play with DeepSeek catalyzing an extraordinarily large TAM (total addressable market) for Indian IT services companies. With the cost of training new AI models being brought down to 1/30th to 1/50th of the earlier paradigm, this makes it possible for small and mid-sized companies and startups to develop new models and launch numerous products based on AI in the next 2-10 years. This enlarges the market for Indian IT services many fold. However, with some uncertainty on the near-term growth rates and valuations slightly high, IT remains potentially alpha-generating.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t “Toy industry is a $400 billion global market, with significant manufacturing happening in China. The budget has allocated funds for the toy manufacturing industry, which could lead to significant growth in the next 10-15 years. At a macro level, we need the economy to clock over 7.5-8% for long-term growth of the market and currency,\" said Ambareesh Baliga, veteran market expert and smallcase Manager.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDr. Vikas Gupta, smallcase Manager &amp; Founder of OmniScience Capital said, “The US Tariffs on China is a big opportunity for India. At a macro level, Trump favors a weak dollar to increase competitiveness of American exports. Add to that it is challenging for the RBI to cut rates given the fall in INR, the central bank may look at other ways to boost market liquidity given INR fall, largely the street is expecting a 25 bps rate cut by the RBI this week.\"</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
