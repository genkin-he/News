This move would be part of Nestle’s global partnership with Starbucks Corporation, which allows it to sell Starbucks’ packaged coffee and beverages outside of its cafes.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAxel Touzet, head of Nestlé’s Coffee Strategic Business Unit, confirmed the development, saying, “We continue to evaluate similar opportunities to expand our coffee portfolio in India to target different coffee consumption moments as more and more people in India look to coffee,\" Mint quoted Touzet as saying.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<h2>\r\n\tExpanding the Starbucks-Nestle partnership</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tNestle and <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/starbucks\" target=\"_blank\">Starbucks</a> signed a global deal in 2018, granting Nestle the rights to market Starbucks’ packaged coffee and food service products in retail stores worldwide. The partnership was later expanded to launch RTD coffee products, such as Starbucks Frappuccinos and Doubleshots, across Southeast Asia, Oceania, and Latin America. Now, Nestle is considering a similar expansion in India.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDespite India being a predominantly tea-drinking nation, coffee consumption is rising, especially in urban areas. Nestle’s Nescafe brand has already introduced coffee to over 30 million Indian households in recent years, and Starbucks’ presence in the country has also grown. The Starbucks-Tata joint venture, which operates over 470 stores in India, recorded revenue of Rs 1,218.06 crore in FY24, marking a 12 per cent increase from the previous year.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<strong>ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/starbucks-no-purchase-no-bathroom-lounging-ends-open-door-policy-niccol-125011500506_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">No coffee, no bathroom: Starbucks ends open-door policy for non-payers</a> </strong></div>\n<h2>\r\n\tIndia’s growing coffee market</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tIndia remains a key growth market for Nestle’s coffee business. The company’s powdered and liquid beverages segment was the largest contributor to its growth in the December 2023 quarter, with retail sales crossing Rs 2,000 crore in the past year. Nestle recently introduced its premium coffee range, Nespresso, in India considering a growing demand for high-quality coffee products.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tA report by ResearchAndMarkets.com suggests that the global RTD tea and coffee market will grow from $107.18 billion in 2023 to $197.4 billion by 2032, driven by evolving consumer preferences. Asia-Pacific is leading this trend, with India among the emerging markets.</div>\n<h2>\r\n\tWhat’s next?</h2>\n<div>\r\n\tNestle has not yet confirmed a launch timeline for Starbucks’ RTD coffee in India but sees the market as a significant opportunity. \"India has tremendous potential for coffee. That's why the rights to distribute Starbucks coffee outside of cafes is so important for us,” Touzet said.</div></div>",

The company had booked total orders worth Rs 531.3 crore in the year ago quarter.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn comparison, the BSE Sensex was up 0.7 per cent at 77,756 at 11:21 AM. With today’s decline, the stock price of Triveni has tanked 34 per cent from its 52-week high level of Rs 885, touched on November 26, 2024.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMotilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL) has reduced the revenue estimates for FY26/FY27 to account for the slower ordering, while increasing its FY25/26/27 margin estimates to factor in a higher share of exports. The brokerage firm expects Triveni’s revenue/EBITDA/PAT to clock a CAGR of 25 per cent/29 per cent/28 per cent over FY24-27. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMOFSL has maintained its ‘Buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 780 per share. Key risks to the recommendation would come from a slower-than-expected order inflow growth, particularly in the domestic markets; lower-than-expected margins; and a slowdown in global geographies, the brokerage firm said in the company's results update.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile order booking from India remained subdued in the quarter, the company continues to see good international demand which is reflected in its export order booking that grew 9 per cent YoY to Rs 346.4 crore during the quarter. Domestic order booking, meanwhile, declined 16 per cent YoY to Rs 180.0 crore.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOrder booking continues to reflect good demand from the renewable space particularly from the Waste to Energy (WtE) segment, and biomass-based energy generation.  Export order booking contributed to 66 per cent of the overall order booking in Q3FY25, which places the company well from a profitability perspective and it is likely to aid in generating new business enquiries, the management said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe total consolidated outstanding order book stood at a record Rs 1,820 crore as on December 31, 2024, which is higher by 15 per cent when compared to the previous year. The domestic outstanding order book stood at Rs 640 crore, which was lower by 22 per cent as compared to the previous year. The export outstanding order book stood at a record Rs 1,180 crore as on December 31, 2024, up 55 per cent YoY and contributing to 65 per cent of the closing order book.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe company further said enquiry pipelines remain healthy, with domestic enquiries in particular registering a strong growth during the quarter, suggesting that a rebound in domestic order booking could be underway. On the international front, the company is well placed in sizeable orders across multiple segments which provide confidence for future order bookings and sustaining a healthy growth momentum, the company said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTriveni  is a focused, growing and market-leading corporation having core competency in the area of industrial heat and power solutions, and decentralised steam-based renewable turbines up to 100 MW in size. The company is amongst the leading manufacturers of industrial steam turbines, both in India and globally.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile, in a notable development, on January 29, Triveni bagged an order worth Rs 290 crore from NTPC, in collaboration with Energy Dome, for setting up a 160 MWhr long-duration energy storage system at the Kudgi Supercritical Thermal Power Plant premises. Triveni’s scope includes providing CO2-based battery storage solutions, compressors and heat exchangers, in addition to civil work (10-12 per cent of the order value). </div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn order to cement its position in the areas where it has ventured recently, Triveni expects a higher annual capex run rate, from Rs 40-50 crore currently to Rs 120-150 crore, over the next couple of years. Apart from adding a fifth bay at its Sompura facility, Triveni will also invest in software and testing infrastructure for R&amp;D and qualified personnel, which will help to increase the localisation for new products.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

The company’s management pointed to a global demand-supply imbalance as the primary cause of the weak pricing environment. Although realisations showed a slight improvement sequentially, they are still well below the desired levels, leading to concerns over the segment’s short-term profitability.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTata Chemicals’ US operations have been particularly hit hard by plant production outages, further complicating the company’s ability to meet its revenue targets. Despite this, the management remains hopeful that pricing in the soda ash market will stabilise at lower levels over the coming months, particularly as demand picks up in markets such as India, Asia, and the US. However, the outlook for the Western European market remains more muted, with expectations of flat or marginally declining demand.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Analysts’ view</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnalysts have responded to Tata Chemicals’ Q3 results with caution. Motilal Oswal has downgraded its FY25 Ebitda estimates by 11 per cent, factoring in the weak performance in Q3, as well as the closure of the Lostock plant in the UK, which accounted for around 8 per cent of the company’s total revenue in FY24. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAdditionally, pricing pressures in the soda ash segment are expected to limit profitability in the near-term. As a result, Motilal Oswal has revised its Ebitda  estimates for FY26 and FY27 downward by 10 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively. The brokerage has maintained a ‘Neutral’ rating, with a reduced target price of Rs 1,030.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSimilarly, Kotak Institutional Equities highlighted the company’s international operations’ margin pressures and the continuing weakness in pricing. While Tata Chemicals expects prices to eventually recover from their current depressed levels, Kotak Institutional Equities has sharply cut its earnings per share (EPS) estimates for FY25, slashing them by 26-34 per cent. The brokerage has also lowered its fair value (FV) estimate for Tata Chemicals to Rs 750 from Rs 840, maintaining a ‘Sell’ rating on the stock.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThat said, in the face of ongoing pricing pressures, rising costs, and production challenges, Tata Chemicals appears to be in for a challenging few months. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile the company is optimistic that the soda ash market will recover over time, the road to recovery looks long, and investors may need to brace themselves for a continued period of volatility. </div></div>",

Wrapped into the billions the US spends annually on foreign aid more than any other nation are hundreds of grants for grassroots groups dedicated to fighting for democracy in authoritarian countries around the world.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAmong the groups that won't be receiving critical funding is an organisation that trained poll workers to detect fraud in Venezuela's recent presidential vote, pro-democracy activists in Cuba and China and a group of Belarusian exiles behind a campaign to block the country's strongman from winning a sham election.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tCutting funding to these essential efforts sends the wrong signal to dictatorships and undermines the brave individuals fighting for freedom, said Thor Halvorssen, founder of New York-based Human Rights Foundation, which does not receive US government funding. These particular investments should not just be restored they should be prioritised.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCongress budgeted at least $690 million on pro-democracy programmes this year to counter authoritarian rule in eight countries considered by experts among the world's least free: Belarus, China, Cuba, Iran, Nicaragua, North Korea, Russia and Venezuela.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tMuch of the pro-democracy funding is channelled through the US Agency for International Development, where hundreds of employees were laid off amid attempts by billionaire Elon Musk to shut down the decades-old agency as part of his campaign to slash spending.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tTrump, announcing the aid freeze on his first day in office, said all foreign assistance would be evaluated as to whether it makes the United States safer, stronger and more prosperous.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTo overhaul USAID, he's relying on Peter Marocco, a former US marine and conservative activist from Dallas who briefly worked for the agency USAID during the first Trump administration. Marocco didn't respond to an AP request for comment and The White House pointed to Trump's comments Monday slamming USAID as being run by radical left lunatics.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhile funding for some of the programmes aligned with Trump's America First foreign policy could resume, strongmen throughout the world are already celebrating and doubling down on attacks against opponents.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIn Venezuela, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, the main enforcer of the ruling socialist party's security apparatus, boasted last week on state TV that the aid channelled by USAID to the opposition was a black box of corruption that he vowed to investigate.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFormer Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said on X that he hopes the notorious Deep State doesn't swallow\" Musk for pulling the plug on the agency.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn Nicaragua, a TV network owned by President Daniel Ortega's sons declared that Trump turned off the faucet for the terrorists.\" Media outlets aligned with the Islamic leadership in Iran joked that the US was treating its allies like disposable tissues.\"<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tMeanwhile, in Belarus, President Alexander Lukashenko crowed that Trump's decision to cut funding for the fugitive opposition was in response to his government's calls for a reset of bilateral relations.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tLena Zhivoglod, head of Honest People, which was set up in 2020 to counter Lukashenko's official narrative and end three decades of his iron-fisted rule, said that she will soon have to lay off 15 staffers and terminate the lease on the group's office in Warsaw, Poland.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis isn't about 15 Belarusian emigrants in Poland being forced to leave their jobs, said Zhivoglod. It means losing yet another battle to the propaganda machines of the Lukashenko regime and the Kremlin machines that bombard Belarusians daily.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe outlook was similarly bleak in Venezuela.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAmong those impacted in the South American nation are journalists who've exposed corruption by top military and civilians officials, an organisation that provides legal services to political prisoners and an election monitoring group that helped uncover credible evidence that President Nicolas Maduro stole last summer's election.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAll of the organisations asked The Associated Press not to be named for fear the government could activate a new law making it a criminal offence to receive international funding.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTrump is doing the work that Maduro could never accomplish: suffocating civil society, said one of the activists impacted by the funding freeze and who on Monday started laying off dozens of contractors who've played a key role mobilizing opposition to Maduro.</p><p></p></div>",

After struggling with the bat during the T20 series against England, he is now likely to be away from cricketing action for five to six weeks after picking up a fracture in his index finger during the fifth T20 International against England in Mumbai on Sunday.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> Samson received a nasty blow from English pacer—and his Rajasthan Royals teammate—Jofra Archer’s delivery but was able to continue playing after some medical attention. His presence on the field made fans believe the blow was not of a serious nature.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> However, the latest media reports suggest otherwise.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/cricket/champions-trophy/schedule\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Check ICC Champions Trophy 2025 full schedule, match timings (IST) here</strong></a></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Ruled out of Ranji Trophy quarterfinals</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tSamson has already returned to Thiruvananthapuram and will undergo rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) before resuming training. According to reports, Samson’s injury would require at least five to six weeks of recovery before he could resume proper net sessions. Given this timeline, he would be unavailable for Kerala’s Ranji Trophy quarterfinal against J&amp;K in Pune from February 8-12.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Return in IPL 2025?</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tSamson’s comeback would most likely happen during the IPL, where he will once again captain Rajasthan Royals in IPL 2025.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> The reports further revealed that his return to competitive cricket would depend on clearance from the NCA after completing rehabilitation, and if the timeline extends beyond initial estimates, he could also miss the early stages of IPL 2025.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/cricket/news/india-vs-england-odis-full-list-of-series-results-for-ind-vs-eng-125020400424_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">India vs England ODIs: Full list of series results for IND vs ENG</a></strong></div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small> <small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>The injury incident</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tSamson, who endured a disappointing series against England, sustained the injury when a third delivery from Archer, bowled at nearly 150 kmph, struck his right index finger. Despite the painful blow, he managed to hit a six and a four but later experienced severe swelling in the dugout.
