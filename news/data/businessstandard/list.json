The battle for the wicketkeeper’s slot is not just about who dons the gloves but also about the balance of India’s middle order.  </div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Rahul’s Stability vs Pant’s Explosiveness</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKL Rahul, who seamlessly took over the wicketkeeping duties in Rishabh Pant’s absence during the 2023 World Cup, was nothing short of exceptional. With 452 runs and a reputation for anchoring the middle order, Rahul emerged as one of India's most reliable performers. His calm presence at the crease has been a cornerstone of India's ODI setup, ensuring stability under pressure.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tYet, his game is not without its flaws. While he provides a solid foundation, his strike rotation in the middle overs remains a lingering concern. In modern ODI cricket, where acceleration is key, this could tilt the scales in favor of a more aggressive alternative.  </div><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEnter Rishabh Pant—the maverick left-hander who brings unpredictability, raw power, and an uncanny ability to turn matches on their head. In an Indian batting lineup heavily dominated by right-handers, Pant’s presence adds much-needed variety. His fearless stroke play and ability to clear the ropes with astonishing ease make him an undeniable X-factor. <small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/cricket/champions-trophy\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Check latest news on ICC Champions Trophy 2025 here</strong></a></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>A Dilemma That Could Cost Iyer?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndia’s team management could look to accommodate both Rahul and Pant, but that might come at the expense of Shreyas Iyer. Despite a lackluster showing in the Sri Lanka series, Iyer’s track record in ODIs and his consistency in the domestic circuit cannot be overlooked. He has been a proven match-winner, and leaving him out would be a tough call.  </div><div id=\"between_article_content_10-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tIndia vs England head-to-head in ODIs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n\t\tTotal matches played: 1-7</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tIndia won: 58</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tEngland won: 44</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tNo result: 3</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tTied: 2</li>\n</ul>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tIndia vs England squads</h2>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>India squad for England ODI series:</strong> Rohit Sharma (C), Shubman Gill (VC), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (WK), Rishabh Pant (WK), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohd.

One, enterprises are rapidly shifting their businesses to digital platforms, including cloud, a trend that has accelerated post Covid-19 pandemic. Two, increased accessibility of high-speed data has led to a surge in internet usage, including social media, over-the-top (OTT) platforms and digital payments.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn addition to the ongoing demand, rapid advancement of GenAI, which requires higher computational power and low latency than traditional cloud computing functions will also provide tailwind to the data centre demand in India.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTypically, the debt to equity ratio for such data centre projects is about 80:20. These are capital intensive projects involving highly automated set-up. The employment generation is minimal and has limited benefits for the surrounding ecosystem in terms of generation of economic activity.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to Crisil, to meet the growing data centre demand, an investment of Rs 55,000-65,000 crore is required over the next three fiscals, primarily towards land and building, power equipment and cooling solutions. Data centre operators typically build infrastructure -- land and building, which account for 25-30 per cent of overall capex -- with the expectation of future tie-ups. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
