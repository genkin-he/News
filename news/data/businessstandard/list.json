In a little more than two weeks since Trump took office, the world's richest man has created an alternative power structure inside the federal government for the purpose of cutting spending and pushing out employees.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNone of this is happening with congressional approval, inviting a constitutional clash over the limits of presidential authority.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tTrump says Musk is doing his bidding</h3>\n<p>\r\n\tMusk has been named as a special government employee, which subjects him to less stringent rules on ethics and financial disclosures than other workers. Trump has given Musk office space in the White House complex where he oversees a team of people at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe team has been dispersed throughout federal agencies to gather information and deliver edicts. Some of them were spotted on Monday at the Department of Education, which Trump has vowed to abolish.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tRepublicans defend Musk as simply carrying out Trump's slash-and-burn campaign promises. Trump made no secret of his desire to put Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur behind the electric automaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX, in charge of retooling the federal government.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tElon can't do and won't do anything without our approval, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Republican president also played downs concerns about Musk's conflict of interests as he flexes his power over the bureaucracy even though his businesses face regulatory scrutiny and have federal contracts.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhere we think there's a conflict or there's a problem, we won't let him go near it, but he has some very good ideas, Trump said.</p>\n<h3>\r\n\tMusk persists in spite of Democrats' outrage</h3>\n<p>\r\n\tDemocrats, for their part, accused Musk of leading a coup from within the government by amassing unaccountable and illegal power.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tWe will do everything in our power in the Senate and the House to stop this outrage, Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland said. And in the meantime, since we don't have many Republican colleagues who want to help us, we are doing everything we can with our colleagues through the courts to make sure that we uphold the rule of law.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe apex of Musk's work so far came on Monday at the Washington headquarters for the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, where yellow police tape blocked access to the lobby and hundreds of employees were locked out of computer systems. Musk said Trump had agreed to let him shutter the agency.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIt's not an apple with a worm in it, what we have is just a ball of worms, Musk said of the world's largest provider of humanitarian, development and security assistance. \"You've got to basically get rid of the whole thing. It's beyond repair.</p>\n<h3>\r\n\tFederal workers are in uncharted territory</h3>\n<p>\r\n\tMusk has also turned his attention to the General Services Administration, or GSA, which manages federal government buildings. An email sent last week from the Washington headquarters instructed regional managers to begin terminating leases on roughly 7,500 federal offices nationwide.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe initiative is being led by Nicole Hollander, according to an agency employee who requested anonymity to discuss internal matters. Hollander describes herself on LinkedIn as an employee at X, Musk's social media platform.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThis has gone beyond the pale. This is out of control. This is not a normal situation, said Keya Chatterjee, executive director of Free DC, a local advocacy organisation. She participated in a protest on Monday outside the Office of Personnel Management, which is one of the lesser-known federal agencies key to Musk's agenda.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMusk's work has unnerved federal employees who are being nudged toward the exits. On Sunday night, concerns swept through the workforce that they could be locked out of internal human resources system, denying them access to their own personnel files that showed pay history, length of service and qualifications.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tSupervisors in some agencies encouraged employees to download their records, called an SF-50, to personal computers so that they could prove their employment history in the event of disputes.</p>\n<h3>\r\n\tMusk's penchant for dabbling</h3>\n<p>\r\n\tMusk has been tinkering with things his entire life, learning to code as a child in South Africa and becoming rich with the online payment company PayPal. He bought the social media platform Twitter a little more than two years ago, renamed it X and slashed its workforce while turning it into his personal political megaphone.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNow Musk is popping open the hood on the federal government like it's one of his cars or rockets.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Silicon Valley playbook to disrupt the status quo by disregarding and disobeying rules that you don't like is in full effect here, said Rob Lalka, an expert on entrepreneurship and innovation in business at Tulane University.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOne of the most significant steps was gaining access to the US Treasury payment system, which is responsible for 1 billion payments per year totaling $5 trillion. It includes sensitive information involving bank accounts and Social Security payments.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNo one outside of the staff doing the work ever asked to have access to the payment files, said Richard Gregg, who spent four decades working for Treasury and oversaw the payment system as fiscal assistant secretary.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIt's unclear what Musk wants to do with the payment system. He's claimed that he could trim $1 trillion from the federal deficit just by addressing waste, fraud and abuse.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThat's the biggest data hack ever in the world, Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, told reporters in Madison. I am outraged about it.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent must revoke Musk's access to the payment system.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe must halt this unlawful and dangerous power grab, he said on Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tA group representing retirees and union workers sued Bessent and the Treasury Department on Monday to get them to stop sharing personal and financial information with DOGE.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_10-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tTrump rewards Musk's fealty</h3>\n<p>\r\n\tMusk's role is partially a reward for his work on behalf of Trump during the campaign. He spent roughly $250 million supporting Trump through America PAC, which included door-to-door canvassing and digital advertising.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAlthough the PAC has not announced its next plans, Musk has suggested that he could endorse primary challenges to Republican lawmakers who defy Trump's agenda.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe more I've gotten to know President Trump, the more I like him,\" Musk said in a conversation streamed live on X. \"Frankly, I love the guy. He's great.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMusk also described his work overhauling the federal government in existential terms, making it clear that he would push as hard and as far as he could.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIf it's not possible now, it will never be possible. This is our shot,\" he said. \"This is the best hand of cards we're ever going to have. If we don't take advantage of this best hand of cards, it's never going to happen.</p><p></p></div>",

The NSE Nifty 50 index rallied to 23,739 in-line with a recovery in global markets after Donald Trump decided to 'pause' hike in tariff on Canada-Mexico by a month.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> Since the start of the month, the US President Donald Trump imposed a 25 per cent tariff on Canada-Mexico, and 10 per cent duty on goods from China. In a retaliatory move, China too has sanctioned tariff hikes up to 15 per cent on select US imports.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> On the bourses on Tuesday, technically, the Nifty formed a big green candle of daily scale, indicating strength. Furthermore, the index crossed the barrier of 23,630 - 23,640 and remained above it, indicating fresh buying interest, said Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C.

Key levels here</a></strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> On the upside, 23,750 - 23,800 will act as an immediate hurdle for the index, where the trend line resistance is placed. Sustaining above 23,800 unlocks the door for 24,000 - 24,200. As long as the Nifty holds 23,630, traders are advised to follow a buy-on-dips strategy, a note from the analyst read.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <strong>FIIs, DIIs, Retail trading action in F&amp;O</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> According to data from the National Stock Exchange, FIIs net bought index futures to the tune of Rs 5,353.50 crore on Tuesday. They net purchased 30,713 contracts of index futures, primarily Nifty futures (26,750).<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> Pursuant to which, the FIIs long-short ratio in index futures dropped sharply from 8.5:1 to 5:1. This ratio now implies that FIIs hold 5 short positions in index futures for every long trade. As against the earlier ratio, wherein FIIs held 8.5 short bets in index futures.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <strong>ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/markets/news/here-s-why-feb-f-o-series-could-be-bullish-for-nifty-key-analysis-here-125013100290_1.html?1738725848\" target=\"_blank\">Here's why Feb F&amp;O series could be bullish for Nifty; key analysis here</a></strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> Among the other key participants, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) long-short ratio in index futures stands at 1.15, retail investors at 2.52 and proprietary traders at 1.42 - all three categories seen holding bullish bets on index futures.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <strong>Nifty options hint at further gains</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> The Nifty options data reflects a moderately bullish undertone, as put writers maintain a subtle edge over call writers, indicating a shift in seller positions, explains Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivatives Analyst at SAMCO Securities.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> The Nifty 24,000-call strike witnessed a sharp increase in open interest (1.56 crore contracts), reinforcing it as a strong resistance zone. Meanwhile, substantial put writing at the 23,000 strike (1.23 crore contracts) signals solid downside support.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> Noteworthy put additions between 23,300 and 23,500 further solidify the support base, while call unwinding at higher strikes hints at a potential bullish repositioning. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) ticked up to 0.94 from 0.74, suggesting growing bullish sentiment, while the 'max pain' level at 23,600 implies limited downside risk despite market swings, the analyst said in a note.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small><br/></div>",
