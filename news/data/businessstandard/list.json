Over the next two decades, Ms Pai explored her hometown, leading children and adults on heritage walks around the city and state, as part of her work with BangaloreWalks, the city’s first heritage walks company that she co-founded with her husband.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn a sense, she rediscovered her city by researching its history, walking its neighbourhoods, exploring its restaurants and cafes, and meeting its people. Filled with historical anecdotes and insightful observations, the essays in this collection are an outcome of this, capturing the unique essence of Bengaluru, and its evolution from being a small 16th-century settlement on a hill to the global metropolis that it is today.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOne of the first things that strikes visitors about Bengaluru is its pleasant climate through most of the year. Despite the traffic, the heart of the city has two large public parks, both of which are over 150 years old. In 1760, Hyder Ali set up Lalbagh, a botanical garden that continues to be a popular spot in the city. Then, British army officer Sir Mark Cubbon founded the Agri-horticultural Society in 1839 and Sir Richard Hieram Sankey designed Cubbon Park. Further, John Cameron, known as the father of horticulture in Karnataka, introduced apple cultivation to the city in 1887.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThrough the ages, rulers and administrators brought in expert gardeners, botanists and administrators to grow several varieties of flowers, fruit and vegetables. Not only did they plant native flora, they also imported exotic species from around the world, many of which still thrive over the centuries. In fact, it was German horticultural legend Hermann Krumbiege’s idea of “serial blossoming” that has ensured that there are always trees in bloom on Bengaluru’s streets, no matter what the season. “To this day, despite untrammelled growth and urbanisation, the city remains defiantly verdant,” writes Ms Pai.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe book brings to light several interesting facts and trivia, such as the fact that Bengaluru became one of the first cities in India and Asia to receive electric light in 1905. In 2023, the almost century-old palatial Russell Market was restored, in time for Ugadi, which marks the spring season, and is celebrated annually as New Year’s Day, in Bengaluru. “A one-stop shop for flowers, exotic ‘English’ fruits and vegetables, meat and fish to serve British homes and kitchens,” it was conceived by T B Russell, the municipal commissioner at the time. Merchant-philanthropist Sir Ismail Sait has a hospital, street and one of the city’s best-known mosques named after him, all located in the Fraser Town neighbourhood. Sait went on to establish a successful store, The English Warehouse, on St Mark’s Road, selling all kinds of goods imported from England.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPossibly two of Bengaluru’s most famous citizens are its homegrown infotech pioneer N R Narayana Murthy and his wife, bestselling-author Sudha Murty. Ms Pai dedicates a chapter to them, narrating their love story. “There is something very Bengalurean about the fact that it was books that brought the two together,” she writes. Ms Pai goes on to explain how libraries, book launches, author talks, book clubs and bookstores are all such an intrinsic part of the city’s culture. With a steady decline in reading habits across the country, it’s heartening to learn that in Bengaluru, both large chains and even independent bookstores, such as Atta Galatta, Champaca, Bahuroopi, Ankita Pustaka, Harivu Books, Lightroom and Funky Rainbow, continue to blossom.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMs Pai dedicates an entire chapter to the many sporting legends that have emerged from the city over the years, such as Rohan Bopanna, Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble, Mahesh Bhupathi and Prakash Padukone. She also points out that Bengaluru has more Olympic-sized pools than any other Indian city. No surprise then that many of the country’s 28 Olympians, including Nisha Millet, Shikha Tandon and Rehan Poncha are natives of the city. “Bengalurean engagement with sport, whether as players, audiences, patrons, coaches, enablers, or administrators, continues to grow, aided in large part by its beloved champion sportspersons, who invest time, money and talent in their own training centres of sporting excellence across the city,” she writes.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAlong the way, Ms Pai also salutes other well-known personalities who hail from the city, such as Udipi Ramachandra Rao, Sir Mirza Ismail and Dr Rajkumar. During the course of the book, she also pays tribute to various iconic institutions in the city, such as the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, the Kanteerava Stadium, the Indian Space Research Organisation, National Aerospace Laboratories, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, the Indian Institute of Science and the UR Rao Satellite Centre.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKnown today as a hub for pubs, cafes and restaurants, the first outlet of Cafe Coffee Day too opened in Bengaluru in 1996. “Years later, CCD would be hailed as the pioneer of Bangalore’s booming cafe society,” writes Ms Pai. However, few people probably know that Koshy’s or Parade Cafe, founded way back in 1952, was the city’s original Indian-owned cafe. Ms Pai also discusses Bengaluru’s homegrown newspaper  <em>Deccan Herald</em>,  which was founded in 1948, relating her special relationship with the daily where she got her first byline at the age of 17. In other essays, she talks about the rising trend of board game cafes in the city, the Bangalore Press and the vibrant Bangalore Literature Festival.</div>\n<div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<hr/>\n</div>\n<div>\n<em>The reviewer is a freelance writer based in New Delhi</em></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

The ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)’s campaign in Delhi has centred on how its schemes will help save up the poor and middle class families up to Rs 25,000 per month.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe PM said the current term of his government was only its third. “We have to achieve greater goals of modern and strong India. We will continue to work for many more years to realise the dream of Viksit Bharat by 2047,” Modi said. The PM said his government’s steps, including identifying non-existent beneficiaries, prevented wasteful expenditure that helped the treasury. In a reference to the controversy over the official bungalow constructed for the Delhi chief minister, Modi said the money saved was used for the welfare of the people, not to build “Sheeshmahal”.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to the Prime Minister’s Office, the PM will visit the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj on Wednesday and at around 11 am, he will take a holy dip at the Sangam.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile he did not name them directly, the PM’s speech was peppered with scathing attacks on first PM Jawaharlal Nehru’s foreign policy, urging people to read ‘JFK’s Forgotten Crises’ (a book by author Bruce Riedel published in 2015) and the “corruption” that marred Rajiv Gandhi’s tenure. Referring to Rajiv Gandhi’s tenure, Modi spoke of him as someone who did not understand the ground reality of the country and the challenges that its poor faced. He ridiculed Rajiv’s repeated references to preparing the country for the 21st Century while failing to deliver on the people’s needs.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn his speech on Monday, Rahul Gandhi had spoken of how the Rajiv Gandhi-led government prepared for the computer revolution of the late 1980s, unlike the present government that, he said, has failed to prepare the country for the current technological transformation.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn further reference to the AAP and Kejriwal, the PM said “some parties are like ‘AAP-da’ (calamitous) for the future of the youth” as they promise various kinds of doles at the type of elections but never fulfil them. He said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance secured historic wins in Maharashtra and Haryana and delivered on its promises, such as filling government vacancies.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe PM detailed his government’s measures for the poor, farmers, youth, and women, and for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes. He spoke of the Budget’s focus on creating jobs by supporting the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector, and the tax exemption announced in the budget, which has meant that the salaried class will have to pay no tax for income up to Rs 12.75 lakh.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWithout naming the Gandhi family, the PM bemoaned the “insult” to President Droupadi Murmu. In another reference to three members of the Gandhi family currently in Parliament, Modi asked whether three members of an SC or an ST family were MPs in Parliament. Currently, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra are MPs in the Lok Sabha and their mother, Sonia Gandhi, is an MP in the Rajya Sabha. The PM said those who entertain themselves by indulging in photo sessions done in huts of the poor will find the talk about the poor in Parliament boring. “Those who walk around with pockets in the Constitution, do they know how they forced Muslim women to live in hardship. We brought in the triple talaq law to give rights to them,” Modi said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCriticising Rahul Gandhi’s comments made at the inauguration of the Congress’ headquarters in the national capital on December 28, Modi said: “Today some people are openly speaking the language of urban naxals. The things that urban naxals say (are being said). These people who speak the language of urban naxals, who declare war against the Indian State, can neither understand the Constitution nor about the country's unity.” At that occasion, Rahul Gandhi had said: “We are now fighting the BJP, the RSS and the Indian State itself”.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe PM said his government did not give false slogans, but delivered real development to people. “Till five decades, slogans of garibi hatao were heard and now 250 million poor have come out of poverty,\" he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tLater, after the LS was adjourned for the day, Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said the PM has lost his connection with the people and their needs. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor termed it an election speech.</div></div>",

This includes the Rs 2,000 crore (approximately $230 million), and the $50 million secured from Matrix Partners India in early 2024.

Until now, Krutrim had not disclosed details about its GenAI models.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAmong the models released to the open-source community are Krutrim 2 and Krutrim 1, both large language models (LLMs). “While Krutrim 1 (India’s first LLM) was launched on January 24, it was a basic 7B model. We’re launching Krutrim 2 today as a much improved model,” said Aggarwal. The company claims that Krutrim 2 is a best-in-class LLM for Indic languages.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Krutrim-2 is a 12 billion parameters dense transformer model, built on the Mistral-NeMo architecture. Our team ensured that Krutrim-2 received comprehensive training on a rich dataset encompassing English, Indic languages (hundreds of billions of tokens), code snippets, mathematical concepts, literary works, and high quality synthetically generated content. It is natively multilingual (English and 22 Indian languages) and supports a context window of 128K tokens,” said the firm’s blog.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKrutrim also introduced Chitrarth 1, a vision-language model built on Krutrim 1, capable of interpreting images and documents. Additionally, the firm unveiled Dhwani 1, a speech-language model designed for tasks such as speech translation, and announced Vyakhyarth 1, an art Indic Embedding model for use cases like search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAggarwal further announced the development of benchmarks to assess Indian LLM performance. “Since there was no global benchmark for Indic performance, we’ve developed ‘BharatBench,’” he said. This evaluation tool is designed to assess AI models’ effectiveness in Indian languages and cultural contexts.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhether BharatBench will gain acceptance among other Indian AI developers remains to be seen.
