Tax cuts, Fitch Ratings said, may provide a modest consumption boost.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tS&amp;P said the slower growth in capital investments for FY26 does not suggest a deterioration in the quality of government spending. “India’s Union Budget remains in line with our expectation of gradual fiscal consolidation… We believe bottlenecks in executing infrastructure projects will ease as supply chain pressures lessen and general elections are over,” S&amp;P Global Ratings said in a press statement.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tS&amp;P said the Budget allocation for capital expenditure is 3.1 per cent of GDP, unchanged from last financial year and is an increase of 10 per cent year-on-year in absolute terms.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe central government has lowered its fiscal deficit estimate for FY25 to 4.8 per cent of GDP from 4.9 per cent while budgeting a fiscal deficit of 4.4 per cent of GDP for FY26.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tS&amp;P has projected that, combined with central government deficits that may trend down to 4.2 per cent of GDP by FY28, the general government fiscal deficit could gradually decrease to 6.8 per cent of GDP from 7.8 per cent in FY25.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tS&amp;P also said the upgrade trigger for its sovereign ratings rests on a meaningful narrowing of India’s fiscal deficits, such that the net change in its general government debt falls below 7 per cent of GDP on a structural basis. “But a lower debt-to-GDP ratio for India would not necessarily lead to an improved debt burden score. This is due to the country’s very high ratio of government interest servicing to revenue,” S&amp;P said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNoting that fiscal deficit projections seemed realistic, Fitch Ratings said there was a risk of modest slippage in revenue collection targets amid a recent moderation in economic growth. “We expect government capex to remain relatively high, but overall, the fiscal deficit reduction is likely to be slightly contractionary,” Fitch Ratings said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHighlighting that the Budget promotes private and state investments in infrastructure and energy transition, Moody's Ratings said the boost to spending due to rising disposable income would benefit makers of two-wheelers, passenger vehicles and white goods, and ride-hailing service providers.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The latest budget signals a slowing pace of fiscal consolidation, as the government seeks to provide firmer support for economic growth amid a dampened macroeconomic backdrop compared to recent years. Still, we expect the government is within reach of its near-term deficit target of 4.5 per cent by FY26,” Moody’s Ratings said.</div></div>",

He added that university education, in its current form, is a 20th-century creation.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"The way we give out education in the lecture format, which is still the dominant format of education, especially for the higher end of high school and certainly for most universities, is outdated. I personally cannot see how we do not have to completely restructure this,\" he said.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSanyal stated that universities need to focus on creating new knowledge through research and development (R&amp;D). \"Universities will increasingly focus on finding new frontiers of knowledge. Interestingly, their competitors will not be other universities but private or government R&amp;D labs and other spheres that enable new knowledge creation,\" he said. He also suggested that universities could evolve into innovation or startup hubs.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAcknowledging that some disciplines may be exceptions, he said, \"We cannot teach surgery in this particular (AI) format, and there must be other subjects as well. But for a very large part of the education system, you can now essentially automate.\" He elaborated that AI can facilitate personalised learning based on an individual's level of understanding and pace.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDiscussing the perils of AI, he cautioned that in subjects like humanities, there is potential for monoculture, leading to the perpetuation of ideological or preconceived notions.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe also emphasised that AI technology may struggle to create new areas of knowledge that require non-standardised ways of thinking. \"The way AI exists today, it is essentially mining information in various ways. So, if I came up with a completely radical new way of thinking about something, AI would definitely mark me down,\" he explained.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
