Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters last week, \"We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance.\" \"Labor demand is softening but not collapsing,\" said Eugenio Aleman, chief economist at Raymond James.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tJob openings, a measure of labor demand, decreased 556,000 to 7.6 million on the last day of December, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said.

The job openings rate dropped to 4.5 per cent from 4.9 per cent in November.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tLayoffs fell 29,000 to 1.771 million as increases in transportation, warehousing and utilities as well as mining and logging were more than offset by decreases in professional and business services. There were also fewer leisure and hospitality layoffs.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe layoffs rate was unchanged at 1.1 per cent for a fourth straight month. It is, however, becoming harder for laid-off workers to find new jobs as employers remain cautious about adding headcount.
