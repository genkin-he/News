Malhotra took charge as the 26th RBI governor in December. The government is yet to announce an economist deputy governor in the RBI after Michael Patra’s term ended in mid-January. An economist deputy governor takes charge of the monetary policy department and hence a member of the monetary policy committee.

Headline inflation sprinted above 5 per cent in the past four months, while core inflation was relatively stable. The rate cut cycle could be shallow given the inflation concerns, particularly the sharp depreciation of the rupee in recent times. “We are expecting a dovish tone, and a shallow rate cut cycle because we have to look in the context of how much the RBI has raised rates, it was 250 bps, so there is not much room to cut interest rate,” said Sakshi Gupta, principal economist at HDFC Bank. “A 50 bps to 75 basis points rate cut should be able to achieve the neutral rate,” Gupta said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe rupee has come under pressure in recent months, the first after the rate cut by the US Federal Reserve in September, and then the return of Donald Trump as the US President with the threat of imposing import tariffs.
