It attributed the shortfall to a sharp decline in international student enrolments, necessitating cost-cutting measures, including a voluntary redundancy scheme.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, last week, QUB confirmed plans to open a campus in Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City), in 2025. The new facility will initially offer five postgraduate programmes tailored to the Indian economy. QUB claims the expansion will enhance international partnerships and innovation opportunities between India and Northern Ireland, the report said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe report mentioned that the UCU has strongly criticised the university’s decision, arguing that QUB receives significant funding from Stormont’s Department for the Economy and should prioritise job retention in Northern Ireland.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“It is scandalous that QUB is investing heavily in a new campus halfway across the world while axing jobs in Belfast,” said UCU General Secretary Jo Grady.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKatharine Clarke from UCU added that the university was “prioritising expansion abroad rather than safeguarding jobs in Belfast,” while also raising concerns about increased workloads for remaining staff. The union has called an emergency general meeting on Thursday to discuss the issue further.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to the <em>BBC</em>, in response, QUB stated that the financial pressures affecting UK’s higher education had forced it to take “proactive” measures to ensure long-term sustainability. Interim Vice-President Alistair Finlay defended the voluntary redundancy scheme, insisting it provides staff with an opportunity to explore new career paths, with no obligation to apply.</div></div>",
