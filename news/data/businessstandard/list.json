            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tOla founder Bhavish Aggarwal on Tuesday announced an investment of Rs 2,000 crore in his artificial intelligence (AI) firm, Krutrim, with a commitment to invest an additional Rs 10,000 crore by next year.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFurthermore, he announced the launch of KritrimAI lab and said that India’s first AI unicorn has released its work to the open-source community, while publishing several technical reports. This move follows DeepSeek’s recent decision to open-source its own generative AI (GenAI) model.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWith this latest investment, Krutrim has raised close to $280 million. This includes the Rs 2,000 crore (approximately $230 million), and the $50 million secured from Matrix Partners India in early 2024. According to sources, the latest funds were raised through a mix of equity and debt. The company declined to comment on the specifics of the fundraising.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn India's GenAI ecosystem, Sarvam AI is the only other player to have secured funding, raising $41 million in 2023 in a round led by Lightspeed, with participation from Peak XV Partners and Khosla Ventures. Hanooman, another firm developing small language models (SLMs), has also been exploring funding opportunities.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t In a X post, Aggarwal said: “We’ve been working on AI for a year; today we’re releasing our work to the open source community and also publishing a bunch of technical reports. Our focus is on developing AI for India -- to make AI better on Indian languages, data scarcity, cultural context, etc.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe further noted that Krutrim has deployed India’s first GB200 system in partnership with Nvidia, which will be operational by March. “…and we will make it the largest supercomputer in India by end of year,” stated the founder of Ola Electric and Ola Mobility.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn a separate post on January 31, Aggarwal noted that Krutrim is utilising the DeepSeek model. “India can’t be left behind in AI. @Krutrim has accelerated efforts to develop world-class AI… Our cloud now has DeepSeek models live, hosted on Indian servers. Pricing lowest in the world,” he wrote. He added that thousands of developers have already accessed DeepSeek models hosted on Krutrim’s cloud.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTuesday’s announcement of the AI lab is a milestone for Krutrim, marking the first time the company has shared its models with the open-source community. Until now, Krutrim had not disclosed details about its GenAI models.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAmong the models released to the open-source community are Krutrim 2 and Krutrim 1, both large language models (LLMs). “While Krutrim 1 (India’s first LLM) was launched on January 24, it was a basic 7B model. We’re launching Krutrim 2 today as a much improved model,” said Aggarwal. The company claims that Krutrim 2 is a best-in-class LLM for Indic languages.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Krutrim-2 is a 12 billion parameters dense transformer model, built on the Mistral-NeMo architecture. Our team ensured that Krutrim-2 received comprehensive training on a rich dataset encompassing English, Indic languages (hundreds of billions of tokens), code snippets, mathematical concepts, literary works, and high quality synthetically generated content. It is natively multilingual (English and 22 Indian languages) and supports a context window of 128K tokens,” said the firm’s blog.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKrutrim also introduced Chitrarth 1, a vision-language model built on Krutrim 1, capable of interpreting images and documents. Additionally, the firm unveiled Dhwani 1, a speech-language model designed for tasks such as speech translation, and announced Vyakhyarth 1, an art Indic Embedding model for use cases like search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAggarwal further announced the development of benchmarks to assess Indian LLM performance. “Since there was no global benchmark for Indic performance, we’ve developed ‘BharatBench,’” he said. This evaluation tool is designed to assess AI models’ effectiveness in Indian languages and cultural contexts.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhether BharatBench will gain acceptance among other Indian AI developers remains to be seen. Krutrim argued that existing benchmarks in English and Chinese, such as MMLU, ARC, and TruthfulQA, fail to capture India's linguistic and cultural nuances. \"There is a specific need for a benchmark that addresses the diversity of India,” explained the startup.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tAs artificial intelligence (AI) becomes a central driver of innovation, venture capital (VC) investors are stepping up to help portfolio companies navigate the complexities of AI adoption. From advising on strategic integrations to connecting with top-tier AI talent, VCs are offering more than just capital; they are providing the guidance and resources needed to harness AI’s full potential.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tExperts said the rapid rise of AI tools like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Qwen 2.5 has left many startups scrambling to keep up as the pace of disruption accelerates.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“AI is evolving at such an unprecedented pace—what was relevant yesterday may be outdated tomorrow. Given this rapid evolution, the best strategy is to focus on what will remain constant: the need for adaptability,” said Preeti Sampat, partner, Eximius Ventures, a leading VC firm that backs companies across fintech, software-as-a-service (SaaS), frontier tech, and consumer tech.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSampat said most Indian software companies operate in the application layer rather than the infrastructure layer, unlike China, which has made significant strides in foundational AI models like DeepSeek and Qwen. To stay ahead, she said Indian companies must design flexible architectures that can seamlessly integrate multiple AI models as technology advances.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“This is particularly critical now, as the cost of AI is decreasing, making intelligent software development more accessible,” said Sampat. “By maintaining adaptability and focusing on customer needs, application-layer companies can capitalise on these advancements.”</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhen asked how Eximius is supporting its portfolio companies in adopting an AI strategy, Sampat pointed out that it is about enhancing existing software solutions by layering AI capabilities on top to improve functionality. The other aspect is developing AI-native modules, which can be built in a modular fashion. These modules can vary in automation levels, ranging from fully automated to human-in-the-loop systems.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The key is to identify where AI can provide the most value and implement it strategically, ensuring that it enhances efficiency, automation, and user experience in a meaningful way,” said Sampat.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor instance, one of Eximius’ portfolio companies, DecoverAI, is transforming the legal tech space by automating legal service providers (LSPs) in the litigation sector, a trillion-dollar market. DecoverAI focuses on litigation support, making legal workflows more efficient through AI-driven copilots and autonomous agents. Initially, they built copilots to assist lawyers in case preparation and real-time courtroom support. However, with the rise of AI agents, they are now incorporating autonomous workflows that can handle certain tasks independently.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“This balance between AI-assisted and AI-driven automation not only enhances efficiency but also reduces costs, making DecoverAI a standout player in legal AI,” said Sampat.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>AI adoption must be strategic</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnil Joshi, managing partner at Unicorn India Ventures, believes AI may not be applicable as it is to all businesses. However, he said Unicorn India actively evaluates the potential impact of AI on respective businesses and accordingly advises companies on their AI goals.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis includes firms using AI for internal operations to gain an edge over competitors. The other goal is making product offerings AI-compatible so that customers can benefit from cutting-edge solutions.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOne of Unicorn India’s portfolio firms, Genrobotic, recently worked on a robo-arm leveraging AI. It is helping eliminate risks to humans in difficult tasks while improving productivity.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tJoshi said having an AI strategy is crucial, as it involves engaging quality resources for building AI solutions, which is expensive. He also stressed the importance of continuously monitoring and evaluating AI’s impact. Otherwise, companies may end up spending excessive man-hours and resources on solutions that lack practical use cases.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Timely intervention will certainly help companies build the right solutions needed by customers,” said Joshi. “We strongly encourage companies to build in-house AI capabilities or intellectual property. It will certainly help in keeping pace with changes in the tech space.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>AI specialists: A necessity or an option?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSonal Saldanha, vice president for investments at 3one4, said his firm insists that companies experiment with and embrace new AI tools with urgency—not just for marketing.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Because we’re seeing so many real-world examples of impact,” said Saldanha.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t3one4 counts fresh meat and seafood delivery startup Licious, shared electric vehicle mobility company Yulu, and Ayurvedic consumer products firm Kapiva among its portfolio companies.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs far as building AI-enabled products is concerned, Saldanha said teams at various companies already have too much on their plates. Using closed-source foundational model APIs (application programming interfaces) is often the easiest way to get started. Moving to self-hosting open-source models, which provide more flexibility but require greater technical expertise, can be adopted later in the product’s life cycle.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“When it comes to consuming AI products internally, again, the best product wins. Building and maintaining a home-grown implementation of something is often not worth the effort at startups, where focus is especially important,” said Saldanha.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, Saldanha does not buy into the notion that companies need ‘AI specialists’ to succeed. He believes it is as simple as hiring smart engineers who are willing to tinker and learn practical tooling, at least in the beginning. Later, more specialists can be recruited to solve specific growth-related problems.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Helping startups integrate AI</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGowri Shankar Nagarajan, associate partner at Antler India, said his firm provides advisory support to enable portfolio companies to adopt AI.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We have a bunch of AI practitioners who are available to any founder to brainstorm how they should think about using AI and the right tech stack for AI,” said Shankar.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAntler is also actively working with major tech companies to give startups access to AI tools to experiment before setting up a full-fledged product roadmap.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGenerative AI (GenAI) has the potential to add a cumulative $1.2–1.5 trillion to India’s gross domestic product (GDP) over the next seven years, according to a report by EY.
