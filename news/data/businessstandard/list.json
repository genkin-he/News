The rate has dropped from a high of 6.88 per cent last month to align with the benchmark policy repurchase rate of 6.50 per cent. Local swaps have also eased, with the one-year rate falling by as much as 26bps below the RBI’s key rate. \r\n\t<div style=\"float:left\">\n<span class=\"fixed-height-container\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box;display:block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0\"><img alt=\"Charts\" class=\"zoomimg\" data-nimg=\"fill\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;background-size:cover;background-position:0% 0%;filter:blur(20px);background-image:url(\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNk0AAAAC4AKhMfIC0AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\")'/><noscript><img alt=\"Charts\" class=\"zoomimg\" data-nimg=\"fill\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2025-02/05/full/1738739381-9542.png?im=Resize=(640,480)\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%\"/></noscript></span></span></div></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFactors including a pick-up in government spending at the start of the month have also helped shrink the cash shortage, which had risen to Rs 3 trillion late last month, the highest in at least 14 years. The central bank’s dollar sales to protect the rupee from volatility, tax outflows and larger cash withdrawals from banks had added to the tight liquidity.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“There is a need for further liquidity infusion because the pressure on the rupee continues, which necessitates some amount of RBI intervention and that is a drag on liquidity,” said Sakshi Gupta, an economist at HDFC Bank. “As we move into March, there will be tax outflows again.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOf the $18 billion that the RBI plans to inject, it has so far pumped in a little more than $7 billion via open market bond purchases and a foreign-exchange swap.

This has been implemented without diluting margins.

At stake are potentially billions of dollars withheld from Iran through crushing sanctions and the future of a programme on the precipice of enriching weapons-grade uranium.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAnd even when signing an executive order to reimpose his maximum pressure on Iran on Tuesday, Trump suggested he wanted to deal with Tehran.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tMeanwhile, ordinary Iranians worry what all this could mean for them.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt encourages hard-liners inside Iran to continue repressions because they feel the US would have less capability in supporting Iranian people who seek freedom, said Maryam Faraji, a 27-year-old waitress in a coffee shop in northern Tehran.</p>\n<h3>\r\n\tIranian media say Trump's cuts could stop the opposition in Iran</h3>\n<p>\r\n\tThe state-run IRNA news agency said that cutting the budget of foreign-based opposition could affect the sphere of relations between Tehran and Washington.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tNewspapers, like the conservative Hamshhari daily, described Iran's opposition as counterrevolutionaries who had been celebrating\" Trump's election as heralding the \"last days of life of the Islamic Republic.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThey then \"suddenly faced the surprise of cut funding from their employer, the newspaper crowed.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEven the reformist newspaper Hammihan compared it to a cold shower for opponents of Iran's theocracy abroad, an idea also expressed by the Foreign Ministry.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThose financial resources are not charity donations,\" Esmail Bagahei, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, said during a briefing with reporters on Monday. They are wages paid in exchange for services.\"<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\t\"This is a clear sign of America's interventionist policy particularly during the Biden administration, which tried to pressure Iran and meddle in its domestic affairs through financial aid, Bagahei added.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIt remains unclear how funding for Iranian activists and opposition figures would be affected by the USAID decision.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe lion's share of money for civil society in Iran has come through the U.S. State Department's Near East Regional Democracy fund, known by the acronym NERD, which grew as an American response to the Green Movement protests in 2009.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn 2024, the Biden administration requested $65 million for NERD after over $600 million had been appropriated by Congress for the fund, according to the Congressional Research Service. That money and other funding had gone in the past toward training journalists and activists on how to report on human rights abuses, funding access to the internet amid government shutdowns and other issues.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe State Department did not respond to a request for comment over the NERD funding and its future. American officials for years have kept the awardees of NERD grants secret due to what they describe as the risk activists face from Iran, particularly after Iranian intelligence officers have allegedly targeted in kidnapping or assassination plots, US prosecutors say.</p>\n<h3>\r\n\tIran repeatedly hints it's ready to talk to Trump</h3>\n<p>\r\n\tIran also noticed that the US avoided direct criticism of the Islamic Republic during a review by the United Nations Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva last week. For those in Iran's government, there's anticipation this could mean that Trump is willing to negotiate, something he repeatedly brought up in his election campaign as a possibility.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tEven Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, in a speech in September opened the door to talks with the US, saying there is no harm in engaging with the enemy. More recently, he tempered that, warning that sinister plots could still be concealed behind diplomatic smiles.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe must be careful about who we are dealing with, who we are negotiating with, and who we are speaking to,\" Khamenei said last week.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhile Bagahei, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, acknowledged Iran hasn't seen any green light yet for talks, Iran is trying to do everything it can to signal it wants them.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe country's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, who campaigned on outreach to the West, urged officials on Monday to listen to dissent from the Iranian people and avoid further crackdowns like those that followed the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe enemies are hoping that by stirring up disputes within the country, they will throw people into the streets and then ride the wave of protests themselves,\" Pezeshkian said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAs he signed the executive order on Iran on Tuesday, Trump warned the country would be obliterated if he was assassinated by Tehran. But he still left the door open for talks.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tI'm going to sign it, but hopefully we're not going to have to use it very much, he said from the Oval Office. We will see whether or not we can arrange or work out a deal with Iran.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe don't want to be tough on Iran. We don't want to be tough on anybody,\" Trump added. \"But they just can't have a nuclear bomb.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, factions within Iran's theocracy are still likely to oppose talks, whether out of their own self interest or over anger that Trump ordered the 2020 drone strike that killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the country's top general and a revered figure.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThat killing fueled Iranian calls for Trump's assassination and alleged plots against him. In November, the Justice Department disclosed an Iranian murder-for-hire plot to kill Trump. While Iran denied being involved, Tehran has a history of plotting the killing of opponents abroad.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"This will not have any impact on the factions that oppose talks with the U.S. but maybe some moderates find it as an excuse to say that Trump is taking some steps, Iranian political analyst Ahmad Zeiabadi said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFor now though, much of this can seem as conjecture and theorising to many of Iran's over 80 million people who continue to struggle in the grips of the country's ailing economy.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_10-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tTehran taxi driver Gholanhossein Akbari, 27, insisted Iranians like him never benefitted from US support of Iran's pro-democracy activists abroad.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"We did not see any result from the funds the US paid to foreign-based Iranian activists who only make comments in the media, Akbari said.</p><p></p></div>",

He gave a ringing endorsement to India's efforts in building on AI at all levels of the stack, chips, models and \"the incredible applications\".</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"India is an incredibly important market for AI in general, for OpenAI in particular, it's our second biggest market. Tripled users here in the last year, but mostly seeing what people in India are building with AI at all levels of the stack, chips, models, you know, all of the incredible applications,\" Altman, who is on a whirlwind India tour, said.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAltman advocated India to go all out in its AI play. \"I think India should be one of the leaders of the AI revolution. But it's really quite amazing to see what the country has done... embraced the technology and is building the entire stack of things on top of it,\" Altman said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAsked about his advice, as India looks to have a global voice in AI and take a leadership position, Altman said \"it seems to me like it's working\". Altman's bullish view on India's AI efforts is a telling statement given that he had faced a backlash in 2023, when he had expressed doubts about powerful AI models emerging outside of the United State.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tDuring the fireside chat on Wednesday, IT Minister Vaishnaw said that innovation can come from anywhere in the world \"why shouldn't it come from India\".</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAltman's visit, his second one in two years, comes at an interesting juncture when OpenAI's (and indeed the western world's) dominance in artificial intelligence has abruptly been challenged by Chinese upstart DeepSeek, which turned heads with its low-cost AI model R1, built at less than $6 million and guzzling a fraction of compute power when compared to popular models like ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDeepseek overtook ChatGPT as the top-ranked free app on Apple's App Store, as the US tech industry -- that has long-justified injecting billions of dollars into AI investments -- watched in sheer disbelief last week.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAI chipmaker and Wall Street superstar Nvidia shed $590 billion in market capitalisation last Monday, suffering the single greatest one-day value wipeout of any firm in history.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAhead of Altman's visit, a 2023 video of him -- where he had expressed doubts about powerful AI models emerging outside of the United States -- has also resurfaced.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe US has been accelerating its AI efforts and just last month, President Donald Trump announced up to $500 billion private sector investment to fund artificial intelligence infrastructure.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe new company, Stargate, which is being created in partnership with Oracle, SoftBank and Microsoft-backed Open AI, would add to tech companies' large investments in US data centres, huge buildings full of servers that provide massive computing power.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tOn Monday, Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group and OpenAI stepped up their AI partnership with a 50:50 held company -- SB OpenAI Japan.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAltman's visit also assumes significance as OpenAI is facing legal hurdles in India, including cases involving claims of copyright breaches. OpenAI has, however, reportedly maintained it only uses publicly available data and has argued that Indian courts have no jurisdiction to hear the matter.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWith the global tech landscape becoming increasingly dynamic and complex, India is fortifying its sovereign interests with its own AI model.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLast week, India outlined global AI ambitions with plans to build its own 'foundational model' that could take on the might of ChatGPT, DeepSeek R1, and others, as it lined up \"most affordable\" common compute facility powered by 18,693 GPUs to be used by startups and researchers, for creating Artificial Intelligence applications, and new algorithms.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced that India is all set to launch its own safe and secure indigenous AI model at an affordable cost. He said compared to global models costing $2.5-3 per hour of usage, India's AI Model will cost less than Rs 100 per hour ($1.16 per hour) after 40 per cent government subsidy.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe minister had exuded confidence that India will build a foundational model that is world class, and that it will be able to compete with best models across the globe.</p><p></p></div>",
