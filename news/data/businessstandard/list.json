That was where Halep lost in the first round to Daria Snigur of Ukraine 6-2, 0-6, 6-4 and tested positive for the banned drug Roxadustat.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tRoxadustat was approved for use in the European Union in 2021 to treat the symptoms of anemia caused by chronic kidney failure. It stimulates the body to produce more of the natural hormone erythropoietin, or EPO, which has long been a doping product favored by cyclists and distance runners to boost stamina.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHalep initially was given a four-year ban that would have expired in 2026. But she appealed, and the Court of Arbitration for Sport reduced the penalty to nine months in March 2024.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tShe argued that she was exposed to a contaminated supplement that caused her failed test. CAS determined that Halep bore some level of fault or negligence for not exercising sufficient care while using the supplement, but she bore no significant fault or negligence. So that is why, CAS said, her anti-doping rule violations were not intentional.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHalep made her return to the tour later that month at the Miami Open but has played a total of only six matches since then.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tShe leaves the sport with 24 singles titles and more than $40 million in prize money.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTo be competitive again requires much more, and at this moment, it's no longer possible, Halep said Tuesday. I don't want to cry this is something beautiful. I reached world No. 1, I won Grand Slams; it's everything I ever wanted.</p><p></p></div>",
