As the voting winds up, all eyes will be on the exit poll results, set to be released shortly after the polls close. Exit polls have often had hits and misses when it comes to predicting the victory of parties, with more misses in recent elections. Here is a look back on the last two elections in the national capital and how accurate pollsters were in predicting the outcomes.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tWhat are exit polls?</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tExit polls aim to capture the sentiments of voters as they leave polling stations. Conducted right after voters cast their ballots, these surveys offer an initial insight into possible election outcomes. The primary goal is to forecast results ahead of the official count, sparking anticipation and fuelling speculation in the days preceding the official announcement.</div></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tWhile exit polls are widely used by media organisations and political analysts to predict outcomes, they are not always an exact science. Factors such as sample selection, margin of error, and even the willingness of respondents to provide truthful answers can skew results.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tSome of the prominent pollsters that are commonly involved in conducting these exit polls include:</div>\n<div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n\t\tAxis My India  </li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tCVoter  </li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tIPSOS  </li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tJan Ki Baat  </li>\n<li>\r\n\t\tToday’s Chanakya  </li>\n</ul>\n<strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></strong>\n<h2>\r\n\tDelhi elections 2025: AAP vs BJP vs Congress</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe 2025 Delhi Assembly elections will see a three-way contest between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and Congress.</div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tFor the AAP, the elections represent an opportunity to secure a third consecutive term, building on its previous successes in the city. Meanwhile, BJP, which has been riding high on victories in states like Haryana and Maharashtra, is aiming to reclaim ground in the Delhi Assembly. The Congress party is working hard to revive its influence in Delhi.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tLandslide win for AAP in 2015</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIn 2015, exit polls forecast an AAP victory but failed to grasp the magnitude of its win. The average of six major exit polls estimated that AAP would secure around 45 seats, with the BJP projected to win 24 and the Congress one. The actual results, however, saw AAP sweep 67 of the 70 seats, leaving the BJP with just three and Congress with none.</div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tNo poll anticipated AAP crossing the 60-seat mark, and only one (Axis My India) predicted the party could exceed 50, estimating 53 seats. Meanwhile, most pollsters significantly overestimated the BJP’s strength, with all but one placing it above 20 seats.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tExit polls more accurate in 2020</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIn 2020, exit polls got closer to reality but still underestimated AAP’s final tally. The average of eight polls projected 54 seats for AAP and 15 for BJP. The actual results? AAP won 62, surpassing predictions by eight seats, while the BJP secured only eight. Congress was once again wiped out, an outcome correctly predicted by five of the eight exit polls.</div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe India Today-Axis My India poll came closest, forecasting an AAP victory in the range of 59-68 seats and the BJP in the 2-11 range. However, other polls remained overly optimistic about the BJP’s chances, with some predicting over 20 seats.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tExit polls: Hits and misses</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tDelhi’s elections are not the only instances where exit polls have missed the mark. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, nearly every major exit poll forecast a sweeping victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP-led coalition, predicting over 350 seats. The actual results painted a different picture – BJP and its allies secured only 293 seats, leading to public apologies from some polling firms and calls for investigations into their methods.</div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tLikewise, exit polls of Haryana elections last year widely projected a Congress victory, only for the final results to defy expectations. These repeated inaccuracies highlight the challenges of exit polling, including limited sample sizes, non-response biases, and shifts in voter behaviour that are difficult to capture in real time.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tA total of 699 candidates are contesting in the 70 constituencies of the Delhi Assembly. The counting of votes will take place on February 8.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small> <small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tCristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have long been regarded as the two greatest football players of their generation. Since 2007, the duo has set football alight with their extraordinary talent, goal-scoring feats, and longevity in the game. Both have dominated football, breaking countless records, but there are a number of remarkable feats that the Portuguese football sensation has accomplished that are unlikely to be replicated by Messi which is why the 40-year-old can never be . Let’s take a look at five of these outstanding records.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>5. Winning Every Trophy at Two Top Clubs</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRonaldo made history when he became the first player to win every available team and individual honor at two different clubs. He first achieved this feat with Manchester United, and then went one step further by doing the same with Real Madrid. While Messi accomplished similar success with Barcelona, the challenge of winning every major title at two different clubs is something Ronaldo has done that Messi will never replicate—especially due to Messi’s long-standing commitment to Barcelona.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <strong>ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/sports/football-news/birthday-boy-ronaldo-proclaims-himself-best-footballer-in-history-125020500572_1.html\">Birthday boy Ronaldo proclaims himself 'best footballer in history'</a></strong></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>4. Scoring 50+ Goals for Six Consecutive Seasons</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFrom the 2010/11 season to the 2015/16 season, Ronaldo managed to score at least 50 goals in every competition for six consecutive seasons with Real Madrid. This incredible achievement has yet to be matched by any other player, including Messi, who only managed to reach the 50-goal mark three times in a row. Ronaldo’s remarkable consistency in front of goal makes this record seem all but unbreakable for Messi.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>3. Top Scorer in the Champions League for Six Consecutive Seasons</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCristiano Ronaldo has dominated the Champions League over the years, particularly in terms of goal-scoring. He has been the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons—a record that Messi has never come close to matching. Messi’s personal best is three consecutive top scorer titles, which is impressive but far from Ronaldo's unparalleled achievement. With Messi now in his early thirties, this record seems safe in Ronaldo’s hands.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>2. Scoring 40+ Goals in a Season for Two Top Clubs</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRonaldo achieved the feat of scoring 40+ goals in a single season with two different clubs: Manchester United and Real Madrid. In the 2007/08 season, Ronaldo netted 40 goals for United and replicated the performance with 53 goals for Real Madrid in 2010/11. This record could have been a potential target for Messi had he moved to another top league. However, Messi’s refusal to leave Barcelona means that this extraordinary record will likely remain untouched.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <strong>ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/sports/other-sports-news/simona-halep-announces-her-retirement-after-two-grand-slam-titles-125020500184_1.html\">Simona Halep announces her retirement after two Grand Slam titles</a></strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>1. Being the First Player to Feature in the FIFA World XI for Three Separate Teams</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCristiano Ronaldo made history by becoming the first player to be named in the FIFA World XI while playing for three different clubs: Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Juventus. This achievement, which was first recorded at the end of 2018, marks a level of consistency and excellence across multiple teams that Messi is unlikely to replicate. Given Messi's long association with Barcelona and his eventual move to Paris Saint-Germain, this unique record remains beyond his reach.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCristiano Ronaldo has set numerous records throughout his illustrious career, and while Lionel Messi is undoubtedly one of the greatest to ever play the game, there are a few milestones that seem destined to remain solely within Ronaldo's domain. From winning every major trophy at two clubs to consistently dominating the Champions League, these incredible feats have solidified Ronaldo's place in football history.</div></div>",

One has been granted registration while four others are being verified, they said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOn January 27, the BJP-ruled Uttarakhand became the first state in Independent India to implement the Uniform Civil Code, which promotes equal laws for every citizen across all religions and standardises personal laws on marriage, divorce and property.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOn the occasion, Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami launched a portal designed for the mandatory online registration of marriages, divorce and live-in relationships.

evading taxes of $155 million by misclassifying component imports but the carmaker has denied wrongdoing, the latest fight by a foreign automaker with New Delhi over tariffs, according to a document and two sources.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tKia competes with Hyundai and Maruti Suzuki in the world's third-largest auto market, where it has a share of 6 per cent of roughly 4 million units a year, and its Kia Seltos and Sonet SUVs are among the top sellers.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tForeign companies in India face headaches from high taxes and long-drawn-out investigations.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFor example, Tesla has publicly complained about high taxes on imported EVs and Volkswagen last week sued over a demand for a record $1.4 billion in back taxes that it called \"impossibly enormous\".</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tTax officers sent a confidential notice to Kia's Indian unit in April

class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe offence centred on incorrect declaration of imports of components for the assembly of the carmaker's luxury Carnival minivan, the notice showed.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn a statement to Reuters, Kia India said it made \"a detailed response, supported by comprehensive evidence and documentation to substantiate\" its stand and the authorities were still reviewing the matter.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tKia India is committed to complying with all regulations and has \"consistently cooperated with\" authorities, it added.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIndia's finance ministry and customs officials did not respond to Reuters queries.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn its 432-page notice, the government said tax authorities found Kia's Carnival \"car model was being imported in parts or components in separate lots\" via different ports, with the \"intent to discharge lesser customs duty\".</p>\n<p>\r\n\tKia devised the strategy to ensure the imports \"could not (be) detected by customs,\" it added in the notice, issued by a customs commissioner in the southern city of Chennai.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTwo sources said Kia's case was similar to that of Volkswagen, accused of evading a higher tax of 30 per cent to 35 per cent applicable on parts imported in \"completely knocked down\" or CKD form in a single shipment, instead shipping separate parts over days, making them eligible for a tax rate of just 10 per cent to 15 per cent.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tDuring the investigation, Kia's website showed the Carnival model sold in India as being in \"CKD\" form, with retail sales of 9,887 units between 2020 and 2022, the tax notice said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Volkswagen investigation spanned 14 car models from the Skoda Kodiaq to the Audi A3 and the Volkswagen Tiguan.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn contrast, Kia's case concerns only the Carnival model, a seven-seater priced around $73,500, which is among its most expensive cars in India.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Kia could face $310 mn payout</strong></p>\n<p>\r\n\tIndian tax rules could require Kia to pay up to $310 million if it loses the dispute, or roughly double the amount evaded, due to penalty and interest.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe latest available corporate filings in India show Kia's domestic annual sales of $4.45 billion in fiscal 2022/23 were its highest ever, up 53 per cent on the year, for net profit of $243 million.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLast week, India slashed import duties on fully-built high-end motorcycles to 30 per cent, in a move widely seen as looking to placate US President Donald Trump, who has in the past called India a \"tariff king\".</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBut fully-assembled imported cars still attract a levy of more than 100 per cent.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tKia has deposited Rs 278 crore ($32 million) \"under protest\" as it continues to fight the Indian tax notice, which is still proceeding, said a government source who declined to be named as the matter is private.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIn 2022, authorities searched Kia offices and a factory in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh and took statements from India executives, some of whom the document identifies as Chief Procurement Officer Lee Sang Hwa, and Chief Finance Officer Kiho Yoo.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDuring the investigation, Kia executives \"changed their stance and have made efforts to mislead,\" the tax notice stated, referring to statements on imports, manufacturing and taxation.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tKia was accused of importing more than 90 per cent of the parts for Carnival, constituting a car in CKD form, which attracts higher tax, it added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIndia's head of indirect taxes, Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, told Reuters the law was clear and some automakers were flouting it by not paying applicable CKD duties.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\t\"If they are on the wrong side, then the department will have to issue a notice,\" he said in an interview on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\n<p>\r\n\t </p><p></p></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p>\r\n\tIndia has accused South Korea's Kia of evading taxes of $155 million by misclassifying component imports but the carmaker has denied wrongdoing, the latest fight by a foreign automaker with New Delhi over tariffs, according to a document and two sources.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tKia competes with Hyundai and Maruti Suzuki in the world's third-largest auto market, where it has a share of 6 per cent of roughly 4 million units a year, and its Kia Seltos and Sonet SUVs are among the top sellers.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tForeign companies in India face headaches from high taxes and long-drawn-out investigations.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFor example, Tesla has publicly complained about high taxes on imported EVs and Volkswagen last week sued over a demand for a record $1.4 billion in back taxes that it called \"impossibly enormous\".</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tTax officers sent a confidential notice to Kia's Indian unit in April 2024, flagging alleged tax evasion of Rs 1,350 crore, according to a government notice Reuters is reporting for the first time.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe offence centred on incorrect declaration of imports of components for the assembly of the carmaker's luxury Carnival minivan, the notice showed.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn a statement to Reuters, Kia India said it made \"a detailed response, supported by comprehensive evidence and documentation to substantiate\" its stand and the authorities were still reviewing the matter.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tKia India is committed to complying with all regulations and has \"consistently cooperated with\" authorities, it added.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIndia's finance ministry and customs officials did not respond to Reuters queries.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn its 432-page notice, the government said tax authorities found Kia's Carnival \"car model was being imported in parts or components in separate lots\" via different ports, with the \"intent to discharge lesser customs duty\".</p>\n<p>\r\n\tKia devised the strategy to ensure the imports \"could not (be) detected by customs,\" it added in the notice, issued by a customs commissioner in the southern city of Chennai.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTwo sources said Kia's case was similar to that of Volkswagen, accused of evading a higher tax of 30 per cent to 35 per cent applicable on parts imported in \"completely knocked down\" or CKD form in a single shipment, instead shipping separate parts over days, making them eligible for a tax rate of just 10 per cent to 15 per cent.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tDuring the investigation, Kia's website showed the Carnival model sold in India as being in \"CKD\" form, with retail sales of 9,887 units between 2020 and 2022, the tax notice said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Volkswagen investigation spanned 14 car models from the Skoda Kodiaq to the Audi A3 and the Volkswagen Tiguan.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn contrast, Kia's case concerns only the Carnival model, a seven-seater priced around $73,500, which is among its most expensive cars in India.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Kia could face $310 mn payout</strong></p>\n<p>\r\n\tIndian tax rules could require Kia to pay up to $310 million if it loses the dispute, or roughly double the amount evaded, due to penalty and interest.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe latest available corporate filings in India show Kia's domestic annual sales of $4.45 billion in fiscal 2022/23 were its highest ever, up 53 per cent on the year, for net profit of $243 million.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLast week, India slashed import duties on fully-built high-end motorcycles to 30 per cent, in a move widely seen as looking to placate US President Donald Trump, who has in the past called India a \"tariff king\".</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBut fully-assembled imported cars still attract a levy of more than 100 per cent.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tKia has deposited Rs 278 crore ($32 million) \"under protest\" as it continues to fight the Indian tax notice, which is still proceeding, said a government source who declined to be named as the matter is private.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIn 2022, authorities searched Kia offices and a factory in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh and took statements from India executives, some of whom the document identifies as Chief Procurement Officer Lee Sang Hwa, and Chief Finance Officer Kiho Yoo.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDuring the investigation, Kia executives \"changed their stance and have made efforts to mislead,\" the tax notice stated, referring to statements on imports, manufacturing and taxation.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tKia was accused of importing more than 90 per cent of the parts for Carnival, constituting a car in CKD form, which attracts higher tax, it added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIndia's head of indirect taxes, Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, told Reuters the law was clear and some automakers were flouting it by not paying applicable CKD duties.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\t\"If they are on the wrong side, then the department will have to issue a notice,\" he said in an interview on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\n<p>\r\n\t </p><p></p></div>",
