To make public sector units (PSUs) financially viable, the Union Cabinet approved a second revival plan for BSNL and MTNL (the telcos) amounting to Rs 1.64 trillion on July 27, 2022. Revival plan is aimed at upgrading services, rolling out 4G services, augmenting the telecom network, and de-stressing balance sheets.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs BSNL is handling MTNL's operations, fund infusion per revival package has taken place in BSNL, which is managing combined capex for the telcos. Progress on monetisation of MTNL’s certain identified land assets has also been slow, which has since been transferred from the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) to the Department of Public Enterprise (DPE), CARE Ratings said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",
