Meanwhile, BJP, which has been riding high on victories in states like Haryana and Maharashtra, is aiming to reclaim ground in the Delhi Assembly. The Congress party is working hard to revive its influence in Delhi.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tLandslide win for AAP in 2015</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIn 2015, exit polls forecast an AAP victory but failed to grasp the magnitude of its win. The average of six major exit polls estimated that AAP would secure around 45 seats, with the BJP projected to win 24 and the Congress one. The actual results, however, saw AAP sweep 67 of the 70 seats, leaving the BJP with just three and Congress with none.</div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tNo poll anticipated AAP crossing the 60-seat mark, and only one (Axis My India) predicted the party could exceed 50, estimating 53 seats. Meanwhile, most pollsters significantly overestimated the BJP’s strength, with all but one placing it above 20 seats.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tExit polls more accurate in 2020</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIn 2020, exit polls got closer to reality but still underestimated AAP’s final tally. The average of eight polls projected 54 seats for AAP and 15 for BJP. The actual results? AAP won 62, surpassing predictions by eight seats, while the BJP secured only eight. Congress was once again wiped out, an outcome correctly predicted by five of the eight exit polls.</div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe India Today-Axis My India poll came closest, forecasting an AAP victory in the range of 59-68 seats and the BJP in the 2-11 range. However, other polls remained overly optimistic about the BJP’s chances, with some predicting over 20 seats.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tExit polls: Hits and misses</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tDelhi’s elections are not the only instances where exit polls have missed the mark. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, nearly every major exit poll forecast a sweeping victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP-led coalition, predicting over 350 seats. The actual results painted a different picture – BJP and its allies secured only 293 seats, leading to public apologies from some polling firms and calls for investigations into their methods.</div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tLikewise, exit polls of Haryana elections last year widely projected a Congress victory, only for the final results to defy expectations. These repeated inaccuracies highlight the challenges of exit polling, including limited sample sizes, non-response biases, and shifts in voter behaviour that are difficult to capture in real time.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tA total of 699 candidates are contesting in the 70 constituencies of the Delhi Assembly.

The Congress party is working hard to revive its influence in Delhi.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tLandslide win for AAP in 2015</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIn 2015, exit polls forecast an AAP victory but failed to grasp the magnitude of its win. The average of six major exit polls estimated that AAP would secure around 45 seats, with the BJP projected to win 24 and the Congress one. The actual results, however, saw AAP sweep 67 of the 70 seats, leaving the BJP with just three and Congress with none.</div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tNo poll anticipated AAP crossing the 60-seat mark, and only one (Axis My India) predicted the party could exceed 50, estimating 53 seats. Meanwhile, most pollsters significantly overestimated the BJP’s strength, with all but one placing it above 20 seats.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tExit polls more accurate in 2020</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIn 2020, exit polls got closer to reality but still underestimated AAP’s final tally. The average of eight polls projected 54 seats for AAP and 15 for BJP. The actual results? AAP won 62, surpassing predictions by eight seats, while the BJP secured only eight. Congress was once again wiped out, an outcome correctly predicted by five of the eight exit polls.</div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe India Today-Axis My India poll came closest, forecasting an AAP victory in the range of 59-68 seats and the BJP in the 2-11 range. However, other polls remained overly optimistic about the BJP’s chances, with some predicting over 20 seats.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tExit polls: Hits and misses</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tDelhi’s elections are not the only instances where exit polls have missed the mark. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, nearly every major exit poll forecast a sweeping victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP-led coalition, predicting over 350 seats. The actual results painted a different picture – BJP and its allies secured only 293 seats, leading to public apologies from some polling firms and calls for investigations into their methods.</div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tLikewise, exit polls of Haryana elections last year widely projected a Congress victory, only for the final results to defy expectations. These repeated inaccuracies highlight the challenges of exit polling, including limited sample sizes, non-response biases, and shifts in voter behaviour that are difficult to capture in real time.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tA total of 699 candidates are contesting in the 70 constituencies of the Delhi Assembly. The counting of votes will take place on February 8.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small> <small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tCristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have long been regarded as the two greatest football players of their generation. Since 2007, the duo has set football alight with their extraordinary talent, goal-scoring feats, and longevity in the game. Both have dominated football, breaking countless records, but there are a number of remarkable feats that the Portuguese football sensation has accomplished that are unlikely to be replicated by Messi which is why the 40-year-old can never be . Let’s take a look at five of these outstanding records.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>5. Winning Every Trophy at Two Top Clubs</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRonaldo made history when he became the first player to win every available team and individual honor at two different clubs. He first achieved this feat with Manchester United, and then went one step further by doing the same with Real Madrid. While Messi accomplished similar success with Barcelona, the challenge of winning every major title at two different clubs is something Ronaldo has done that Messi will never replicate—especially due to Messi’s long-standing commitment to Barcelona.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <strong>ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/sports/football-news/birthday-boy-ronaldo-proclaims-himself-best-footballer-in-history-125020500572_1.html\">Birthday boy Ronaldo proclaims himself 'best footballer in history'</a></strong></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>4. Scoring 50+ Goals for Six Consecutive Seasons</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFrom the 2010/11 season to the 2015/16 season, Ronaldo managed to score at least 50 goals in every competition for six consecutive seasons with Real Madrid. This incredible achievement has yet to be matched by any other player, including Messi, who only managed to reach the 50-goal mark three times in a row. Ronaldo’s remarkable consistency in front of goal makes this record seem all but unbreakable for Messi.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>3. Top Scorer in the Champions League for Six Consecutive Seasons</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCristiano Ronaldo has dominated the Champions League over the years, particularly in terms of goal-scoring. He has been the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons—a record that Messi has never come close to matching. Messi’s personal best is three consecutive top scorer titles, which is impressive but far from Ronaldo's unparalleled achievement. With Messi now in his early thirties, this record seems safe in Ronaldo’s hands.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>2. Scoring 40+ Goals in a Season for Two Top Clubs</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRonaldo achieved the feat of scoring 40+ goals in a single season with two different clubs: Manchester United and Real Madrid. In the 2007/08 season, Ronaldo netted 40 goals for United and replicated the performance with 53 goals for Real Madrid in 2010/11. This record could have been a potential target for Messi had he moved to another top league. However, Messi’s refusal to leave Barcelona means that this extraordinary record will likely remain untouched.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <strong>ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/sports/other-sports-news/simona-halep-announces-her-retirement-after-two-grand-slam-titles-125020500184_1.html\">Simona Halep announces her retirement after two Grand Slam titles</a></strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>1. Being the First Player to Feature in the FIFA World XI for Three Separate Teams</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCristiano Ronaldo made history by becoming the first player to be named in the FIFA World XI while playing for three different clubs: Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Juventus. This achievement, which was first recorded at the end of 2018, marks a level of consistency and excellence across multiple teams that Messi is unlikely to replicate. Given Messi's long association with Barcelona and his eventual move to Paris Saint-Germain, this unique record remains beyond his reach.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCristiano Ronaldo has set numerous records throughout his illustrious career, and while Lionel Messi is undoubtedly one of the greatest to ever play the game, there are a few milestones that seem destined to remain solely within Ronaldo's domain. From winning every major trophy at two clubs to consistently dominating the Champions League, these incredible feats have solidified Ronaldo's place in football history.</div></div>",

One has been granted registration while four others are being verified, they said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOn January 27, the BJP-ruled Uttarakhand became the first state in Independent India to implement the Uniform Civil Code, which promotes equal laws for every citizen across all religions and standardises personal laws on marriage, divorce and property.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOn the occasion, Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami launched a portal designed for the mandatory online registration of marriages, divorce and live-in relationships. He was the first to register his marriage on the UCC portal.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe UCC's provision for mandatory registration of live-in relationships has been much criticised for its potential to infringe upon people's right to privacy.
