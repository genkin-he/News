            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tThe<strong><a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/telecom-regulatory-authority-of-india-trai\" target=\"_blank\"> Telecom Regulatory Authority of India </a></strong>(Trai) has recommended the auction of several 5G high-band or millimetre wave (mmWave) spectrum in upcoming spectrum auctions. On Tuesday, TRAI said spectrum in the 37-37.5 GHz and 37.5-40 GHz frequency ranges should be auctioned, while it has recommended against auctions for the 42.5-43.5 GHz frequency range.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe move is expected to find support from telecom service providers who have pushed for access to it. MmWave or spectrum bands above 24 gigahertz (GHz) are a valuable resource when targeting densely populated urban areas. The high band offers an opportunity for service providers to offer unprecedented peak rates, low latency, and high capacity.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTRAI has said telcos will have the option to pay for the spectrum upfront or in 20 equal annual instalments. While mmWave is limited due to signals not being able to travel as far as mid- and low-band signals—often travelling less than a mile and being more susceptible to interference from trees, buildings, and even glass—it offers significant benefits. If the signal remains unencumbered, users can achieve connection speeds between 1 Gbps and 3 Gbps or even higher.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe regulator has recommended that, in addition to access service providers, internet service providers and machine-to-machine service providers should also be permitted to participate in the auction.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTRAI had issued a consultation paper on the issue back in April last year. Subsequently, 12 stakeholders submitted comments, and four stakeholders furnished counter-comments. On Tuesday, it also released its recommendations on block sizes for the spectrum bands and the reserve prices for MHz in the 37-40 GHz band. The prices range from a high of Rs 76 lakh in the metro circle of Delhi to Rs 3 lakh in Jammu &amp; Kashmir and the North East.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, TRAI has pointed out that some bands cannot be opened up. \"Owing to the non-availability of the device ecosystem in the 42.5-43.5 GHz frequency range, it will be prudent that the frequency range 42.5-43.5 GHz is not put to auction in the forthcoming spectrum auction. DoT may send a separate reference for seeking the Authority’s recommendations for the 42.5-43.5 GHz frequency range for IMT at an appropriate time,\" TRAI said. Telcos had earlier pushed for opening up spectrum in this band.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile the 37-37.5 GHz band has been globally earmarked for broadband mobile use, the 37.5-40 GHz and 40-42.5 GHz bands have both mobile use and satellite gateway link uses. Similarly, while the 40-42.5 GHz band is only for satellite usage, the 42.5-43.5 GHz band has both usage types. While telcos have called for flexible use between terrestrial and satellite-based networks, arguing that there would be no interference, TRAI has not clarified its stance on the matter.</div></div>",
