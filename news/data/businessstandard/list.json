            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tGold loan portfolio of banks rose by 71.3 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) till December of the current financial year (FY25) to Rs 1.72 trillion, compared to 17 per cent growth a year ago, on the back of rising prices of the yellow metal and slowdown in unsecured loan following increase in risk weights last year.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Over the last year, gold loan growth has sharply increased, with a 68 per cent rise from April 2024 to December 2024 (M9FY25), while gold prices increased by around 21 per cent during the time,” said Ajit Velonie, senior director, Crisil Ratings.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“There has also been a partial slowdown in unsecured loan growth due to stricter regulations. The growth in gold loans has coincided with this period. Personal loans grew by only 5-6 per cent, compared to 16.5 per cent in the previous year. The slower growth in unsecured loans has likely led borrowers to turn to gold loans as an alternative,” said Velonie.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn November 2023, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) increased risk weight for unsecured loans by 25 percentage points to 125 per cent.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe personal loans segment showed 9.7 per cent growth in December 2024, compared to 20.8 per cent in December 2023. Credit card loans also saw moderation in growth at 15.6 per cent in December 2024, down from 32.6 per cent a year ago.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBank credit growth in the retail loan segment, including housing, vehicle, credit cards, and personal loans, dropped to 14.9 per cent Y-o-Y in December 2024, down from 17.6 per cent in December 2023.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe gold loan prices increased by 20.4 per cent to Rs 75,857 per 10 gram in December 2024 from Rs 62,993 per 10 gram in the year-ago period.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Factors contributing to the rise in gold loans include rising prices of the yellow metal, as the value of loans taken against jewellery also increases amid rise in gold prices. People with gold jewellery are also borrowing more to refinance their loans as the value of gold increases,” said Kirti Timmanagoudar, head of strategy and co-lending, IIFL Finance.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The crackdown on unsecured lending and stress in the MFI space might also be contributing factors. It is likely a cumulative effect of these elements, rather than one factor being responsible,” said Timmanagoudar.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording RBI data, since May 2024, one bank has changed the classification of agricultural loan into “Loans against gold jewellery” under the retail segment.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Loans previously classified as agricultural are now being treated as gold loans. This reclassification might explain the slower growth in agricultural loans, which have only grown by 8 per cent compared to previous years,” Timmanagoudar added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The slowdown in supply of unsecured lending might give an impetus but gold loan has been witnessing an upward trajectory due to its own features. Today it is a popular choice among customers, especially for short-term requirements, and acts as a vital financial inclusion tool,” said Shaji Varghese, chief executive officer (CEO), Muthoot FinCorp.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe December edition of the financial stability report (FSR) of the RBI observed the rapid increase in gold loan disbursals during the period ending September 2024 compared to the same time period last year.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo address the non-adherence to prudential guidelines by the supervised entities (SEs) in grant of loans against pledge of gold ornaments and jewellery, the RBI has advised SEs to comprehensively review their policies, identify gaps, and implement corrective measures within a specified timeframe.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

Along with the Rs 2,000 crore (around $230 million) and the $50 million the firm raised from Matrix Partners India in early 2024. According to sources, the Rs 2,000 crore have been raised via equity and debt. The company did not respond to the query of fund raise.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe only other player in the Indian AI ecosystem to raise funds is Sarvam AI, which raised $41 million in 2023, which was led by Lightspeed along with participation from Peak XV Partners and Khosla Venture.

The announcement to open source its model comes at the back of DeepSeek’s announcement to open source its own model.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn a X post, Aggarwal said: “We’ve been working on AI for a year, today we’re releasing our work to the open source community and also publishing a bunch of technical reports.

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tThe<strong><a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/telecom-regulatory-authority-of-india-trai\" target=\"_blank\"> Telecom Regulatory Authority of India </a></strong>(Trai) has recommended the auction of several 5G high-band or millimetre wave (mmWave) spectrum in upcoming spectrum auctions. On Tuesday, TRAI said spectrum in the 37-37.5 GHz and 37.5-40 GHz frequency ranges should be auctioned, while it has recommended against auctions for the 42.5-43.5 GHz frequency range.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe move is expected to find support from telecom service providers who have pushed for access to it. MmWave or spectrum bands above 24 gigahertz (GHz) are a valuable resource when targeting densely populated urban areas. The high band offers an opportunity for service providers to offer unprecedented peak rates, low latency, and high capacity.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTRAI has said telcos will have the option to pay for the spectrum upfront or in 20 equal annual instalments. While mmWave is limited due to signals not being able to travel as far as mid- and low-band signals—often travelling less than a mile and being more susceptible to interference from trees, buildings, and even glass—it offers significant benefits. If the signal remains unencumbered, users can achieve connection speeds between 1 Gbps and 3 Gbps or even higher.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe regulator has recommended that, in addition to access service providers, internet service providers and machine-to-machine service providers should also be permitted to participate in the auction.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTRAI had issued a consultation paper on the issue back in April last year. Subsequently, 12 stakeholders submitted comments, and four stakeholders furnished counter-comments. On Tuesday, it also released its recommendations on block sizes for the spectrum bands and the reserve prices for MHz in the 37-40 GHz band. The prices range from a high of Rs 76 lakh in the metro circle of Delhi to Rs 3 lakh in Jammu &amp; Kashmir and the North East.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, TRAI has pointed out that some bands cannot be opened up. \"Owing to the non-availability of the device ecosystem in the 42.5-43.5 GHz frequency range, it will be prudent that the frequency range 42.5-43.5 GHz is not put to auction in the forthcoming spectrum auction. DoT may send a separate reference for seeking the Authority’s recommendations for the 42.5-43.5 GHz frequency range for IMT at an appropriate time,\" TRAI said. Telcos had earlier pushed for opening up spectrum in this band.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile the 37-37.5 GHz band has been globally earmarked for broadband mobile use, the 37.5-40 GHz and 40-42.5 GHz bands have both mobile use and satellite gateway link uses. Similarly, while the 40-42.5 GHz band is only for satellite usage, the 42.5-43.5 GHz band has both usage types. While telcos have called for flexible use between terrestrial and satellite-based networks, arguing that there would be no interference, TRAI has not clarified its stance on the matter.</div></div>",

Triveni was a collaborative experiment bringing ancient mantras in a global bed of music — and the fact that it succeeded is extremely gratifying.\" </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe 71-year-old business leader made history alongside South African flutist Wouter Kellerman and Japanese cellist Eru Matsumoto, triumphing over notable contenders like Anoushka Shankar and Ricky Kej. About her Indian-origin competitors, Tandon said: \"We had such fantastic fellow nominees in our category with awesome music — it was great to have the Indian roots reflected in full force.\" </div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTandon began her professional career as a Citibank banker in Beirut during the Lebanese Civil War. As one of just eight women in her IIM-A batch, she later became the first Indian-American woman elected partner at McKinsey &amp; Company in the 1980s. In 1992, she founded the New York-based consultancy, Tandon Capital Associates.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSo, is the corporate world still an integral part of her life? <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\t\"Indeed it is,\" she said, \"but it is not only my corporate life but also my work in the US academic sphere as a Trustee of New York University (the largest private global university) and Chair of the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, and other organisations like the New York Academy of Sciences. Keeps both sides of the brain active and engaged.\" </div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFrom Prime Minister Narendra Modi to business leaders like Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw and Harsh Goenka, as well as expatriate organisations such as India in New York, many extended their felicitations. “Congratulations to @chandrikatandon on winning the Grammy. We take great pride in her accomplishments as an entrepreneur, philanthropist, and, of course, musician! It is commendable how she has remained passionate about Indian culture and has worked to popularise it,” Modi posted on X, recalling his 2023 meeting with her in New York.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tA trained vocalist in Carnatic and Hindustani classical music, Tandon was previously nominated for a Grammy in 2011 in the Contemporary World Music category for her debut album, “Soul Call”.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe older sister of former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi, Tandon grew up in Chennai, attended Madras Christian College (MCC), and later earned a master’s degree from the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad. “This remarkable achievement reflects her exceptional talent and dedication to the arts,” MCC’s alumni association posted on X.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDuring an interview for CNBC’s The Brave Ones series, Tandon spoke about a pivotal moment in her career when, despite rapid business growth, she felt unfulfilled. “I started to think… ‘Is this what my life’s going to be? One deal after another?’” she recalled. In the same series, her daughter, Lita Tandon, shared that this turning point led her mother to fully embrace music and the things that brought her joy. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tInspired by her passion, Tandon produced her first album, “Soul Call”, as a gift for her father-in-law’s 90th birthday, featuring recordings of his favourite chants. The album later earned a Grammy nomination for Contemporary World Music in 2011.</div></div>",
