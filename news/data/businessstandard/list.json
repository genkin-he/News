We have a Constitution, Rubio said at a news conference Tuesday in San Jose with Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves. But it's a very generous offer. No one's ever made an offer like that and to outsource, at a fraction of the cost, at least some of the most dangerous and violent criminals that we have in the United States. But obviously, the administration will have to make a decision.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tRubio discussed immigration with Chaves a Trump administration priority as America's top diplomat also faces major upheaval at the US Agency for International Development that has left many at the aid agency and the State Department fearful for their jobs.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhile Rubio has been on a five-country visit in Central America this week, USAID staffers and Democratic lawmakers were blocked from its Washington headquarters Monday after Elon Musk, who is running a budget-slashing Department of Government Efficiency, announced Trump had agreed with him to shut the aid agency.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThousands of USAID employees already had been laid off and programs worldwide shut down after Trump imposed a sweeping freeze on foreign assistance after taking office. Rubio later offered a waiver for life-saving programmes, but confusion over what is exempt from stop-work orders and fear of losing US aid permanently is still freezing aid and development work globally.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tI would say if some organisation is receiving funds from the United States and does not know how to apply a waiver, then I have real questions about the competence of that organization,\" he told reporters. Or I wonder whether they're deliberately sabotaging it for purposes of making a political point.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe also said he has long supported foreign aid. I continue to support foreign aid. But foreign aid is not charity. He noted that every dollar the US spends must advance its national interest.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOne programme hit is an HIV/AIDS programme started by Republican President George W Bush credited with saving more than 20 million lives in Africa and elsewhere. Aid contractors spoke of millions of dollars in medication and other goods stuck in port that they were forbidden to deliver.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAmid the turmoil back home, Rubio met in San Salvador with Bukele, who confirmed the deportation offer in a post on X, saying El Salvador has offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBukele said his country would accept only convicted criminals and would charge a fee that would be relatively low for the US but significant for us, making our entire prison system sustainable.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe State Department describes El Salvador's overcrowded prisons as harsh and dangerous. Its country information webpage says, In many facilities, provisions for sanitation, potable water, ventilation, temperature control, and lighting are inadequate or nonexistent.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tEl Salvador has lived under a state of emergency since March 2022, when the country's powerful street gangs went on a killing rampage. Bukele responded by suspending fundamental rights like access to lawyers, and authorities have arrested more than 83,000 people with little to no due process.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn 2023, Bukele opened a massive new prison with capacity for 40,000 gang members and cut prisoners' meals to twice a day. Prisoners there do not receive visits, and there are no programmes preparing them for reinsertion into society after their sentences and no workshops or educational programmes.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEl Salvador, once one of the most dangerous countries in the world, closed last year with a record low 114 homicides, a newfound security that has propelled Bukele's soaring popularity in the country of about 6 million residents.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tMigration has been the top issue for Rubio on his trip spanning Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic. But he was dogged by other changes that the Trump administration has been making soon after taking office.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tRubio told reporters in San Salvador that he was now the acting administrator of USAID but had delegated that authority so he would not be running its day-to-day operations.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn a letter Rubio sent to lawmakers that was obtained by The Associated Press, he said the State Department would work with Congress to reorganise and absorb certain bureaus, offices and missions of USAID.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tHe said the processes at the agency, which has been hit by Trump's freeze on all foreign assistance, are not well coordinated and that undermines the President's ability to carry out foreign relations.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn consultation with Congress, USAID may move, reorganise, and integrate certain missions, bureaus and offices into the Department of State, and the remainder of the Agency may be abolished consistent with applicable law, Rubio wrote.</p><p></p></div>",
