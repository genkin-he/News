Operating profit (Ebitda) plunged 20.4 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 1,636.7 crore, as against Rs 2,056.1 crore in Q3FY24. Consequently, Ebitda margin contracted 350 basis points Y-o-Y to 19.1 per cent, from 22.6 per cent a year ago..</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn weak performance amid challenging conditions, Amit Syngle, managing director &amp; CEO of Asian Paints, said, “The paint industry continued to be impacted by subdued demand conditions during the quarter, especially in urban centres. We registered a 6.6 per cent decline in overall coatings business in India, including Industrial. The domestic decorative business delivered a 1.6 per cent volume growth, but standalone revenues declined 7.5 per cent, impacted by weak festive season demand.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSyngle also noted that while the company saw sequential improvements in operating margins, the adverse product mix, coupled with higher sales and distribution expenses, affected profitability compared to the previous year.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, not all was bleak. The company’s Industrial Business showed strength, posting a 3.8 per cent Y-o-Y revenue growth, boosted by strong performances in the General Industrial and Refinish segments. Additionally, Asian Paints saw continued expansion in its Home Décor business, along with a 5 per cent growth in its international portfolio, which surged 17.1 per cent in constant currency (CC) terms, driven by robust performance in the Middle East and a recovery in key Asian markets.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDespite these positive indicators, Asian Paints remains cautious. Syngle added, “In the near term, we remain cautiously optimistic on a recovery in demand conditions while we continue to invest in our brand and focus on innovation and customer centricity.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe muted results by Asian Paints have led analysts to raise concerns about the company’s near-term outlook. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tICICI Securities predicts that Asian Paints will face subdued growth in CY25, despite a favourable base in Q4FY25. They expect the stress in urban markets, which has resulted in downtrading, to persist, hurting profitability. Furthermore, the competitive landscape is expected to intensify majorly by H1FY26 as Grasim expands its plants and distribution network, pressuring Asian Paints to prioritise market share over margins. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAdditionally, rising commodity prices and the depreciation of the rupee add further challenges, analysts noted. Thus, ICICI Securities has reduced its FY25-26 earnings estimates by 3 per cent, maintaining a ‘Reduce’ rating. The brokerage has also revised the target price to Rs 2,200.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile, Nuvama has set a revised target price of Rs 3,000 (down from Rs 3,185) while maintaining a ‘Buy’ rating. Despite Q3FY25 results falling below expectations, with a 6.1 per cent decline in revenue and a 20.4 per cent drop in Ebitda, Nuvama highlights growth in the international business and the industrial sector as positives. They’ve also lowered their earnings per share (EPS) estimates for FY25-27 due to a weak demand outlook.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tInCred Equities has set a target price of Rs 2,340 and maintained a ‘Reduce’ rating, citing weak sales. According to reports, Goldman Sachs, with a more cautious stance, has a Sell’ rating, lowering its target to Rs 2,275, primarily due to subdued demand and increasing competitive intensity in the market.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAmong other brokerages, Morgan Stanley reportedly maintained an ‘Underweight’ rating and lowered the target price to Rs 2,358 per share. Jefferies also maintained an ‘Underperform’ rating, setting a target price of Rs 2,000. CLSA shared a similar outlook with an ‘Underperform’ rating and a target price of Rs 2,047. On the other hand, Macquarie remains more optimistic, maintaining an ‘Outperform’ rating with a target price of Rs 2,650.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThat said, as the paint industry grapples with subdued demand and rising costs, Asian Paints' near-term prospects remain uncertain, with analysts forecasting continued struggles in the coming months.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAsian Paints is India’s leading paint and decor company, ranked among the top 8 global coatings companies, with a consolidated turnover of Rs 35,382 crore. The company operates in 15 countries, with 27 manufacturing facilities, and serves consumers in over 60 countries through brands like Asian Paints, Apco Coatings, Asian Paints Berger, and more.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAsian Paints share settled 2.69 per cent higher at Rs 2,355.25 per share, on Tuesday, February 4, 2025.

The NSE Nifty 50 index rallied to 23,739 in-line with a recovery in global markets after Donald Trump decided to 'pause' hike in tariff on Canada-Mexico by a month.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> Since the start of the month, the US President Donald Trump imposed a 25 per cent tariff on Canada-Mexico, and 10 per cent duty on goods form China. In a retaliatory move, China too has sanctioned tariff hike up to 15 per cent on select US imports.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> On the bourses on Tuesday, technically, the Nifty formed a big green candle of daily scale, indicating strength. Furthermore, the index crossed the barrier of 23,630 - 23,640 and remained above it, indicating fresh buying interest, said Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C.

Key levels here</a></strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> On the upside, 23,750 - 23,800 will act as immediate hurdle for index, where the trend line resistance is placed. Sustaining above 23,800 unlocks the door for 24,000 - 24,200. As long as the Nifty holds 23,630, traders are advised to follow a buy-on-dips strategy, a note from the analyst read.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <strong>FIIs, DIIs, Retail trading action in F&amp;O</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> According to data from the National Stock Exchange, FIIs net bought index futures to the tune of Rs 5,353.50 crore on Tuesday. They net purchased 30,713 contracts of index futures, primarily Nifty futures (26,750).<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> Pursuant to which, the FIIs long-short ratio in index futures dropped sharply from 8.5:1 to 5:1. This ratio now implies that FIIs hold 5 short positions in index futures for every long trade. As against the earlier ratio, wherein FIIs held 8.5 short bets in index futures.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <strong>ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/markets/news/here-s-why-feb-f-o-series-could-be-bullish-for-nifty-key-analysis-here-125013100290_1.html?1738725848\" target=\"_blank\">Here's why Feb F&amp;O series could be bullish for Nifty; key analysis here</a></strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> Among the other key participants, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) long-short ratio in index futures stands at 1.15, retail investors at 2.52 and proprietary traders at 1.42 - all three categories seen holding a bullish bets on index futures.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <strong>Nifty options hint at further gains</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> The Nifty options data reflects a moderately bullish undertone, as put writers maintain a subtle edge over call writers, indicating a shift in seller positions, explains Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivatives Analyst at SAMCO Securities.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> The Nifty 24,000-call strike witnessed a sharp increase in open interest (1.56 crore contracts), reinforcing it as a strong resistance zone. Meanwhile, substantial put writing at the 23,000 strike (1.23 crore contracts) signals solid downside support.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> Noteworthy put additions between 23,300 and 23,500 further solidify the support base, while call unwinding at higher strikes hints at a potential bullish repositioning. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) ticked up to 0.94 from 0.74, suggesting growing bullish sentiment, while the 'max pain' level at 23,600 implies limited downside risk despite market swings, the analyst said in a note.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small><br/></div>",

Nobody else would want to hold it back. Look, we have to tell the teachers union we’re rated last in the world in education.”</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrump said his primary concern was improving education after tests showed students lagging well behind historical standards, as well as other Western nations, despite federal spending on students. He said he believed that giving states more control over education while dismantling federal oversight would benefit more students.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe president’s comments come amid reports that the White House was preparing an executive action intending to dismantle the department. White House officials have said only that preparations were being made to fulfill Trump’s campaign promise to do so.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tStill, any effort is likely to face resistance from teachers unions, which have historically viewed efforts to turn control over to the states skeptically in part because they could funnel funds to private and charter schools staffed by educators without similar certifications. Those unions have historically backed Democratic presidential candidates, making the prospect of collaborating with Trump a long shot.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAbolishing the Department of Education would also be a challenging task. The agency has broad responsibilities: last year it distributed approximately $121 billion in federal grants, loans and work-study programs to nearly 10 million people, according to a fiscal year report. An annual application, known as FAFSA, managed by the agency has also become a fixture in the college application process, used by universities to help determine eligibility for scholarships. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrump has nominated Linda McMahon, the onetime CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment who also ran the Small Business Administration in his first term, to head the agency. McMahon is awaiting confirmation, but the president has already moved to rein in the department, part of a broad assault aimed at reducing government spending and responsibilities and shrinking the size of the federal workforce.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“I told Linda: ‘Linda, I hope you do a great job and put yourself out of a job,’” Trump said Tuesday.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAt least 70 employees were placed on leave at the Education Department in recent days, according to Brittany Holder, a spokesperson for the American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents some staffers at the agency. But that figure only accounts for members and employees who fall under the union, according to Holder, and the actual figure could be higher.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSome Education Department employees put on leave were caught in the administration’s efforts to purge federal workers involved in diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Overall, the department has around 4,200 employees, according to its website.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We are evaluating staffing in line with the commitment to prioritizing meaningful learning ahead of divisive ideology in schools and putting student outcomes above special interests,” Madison Biedermann, an Education Department spokesperson, said in a statement.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDespite longstanding pressure from conservatives to shrink or do away with the Education Department, lawmakers have balked at eliminating it before. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tStill, that pressure has intensified with Trump’s reelection after a campaign in which many issues dealing with education became political flash points, including former President Joe Biden’s student-loan debt relief, and criticism over teachings on race, gender and sexuality in schools.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

He said he believed that giving states more control over education while dismantling federal oversight would benefit more students.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe president’s comments come amid reports that the White House was preparing an executive action intending to dismantle the department. White House officials have said only that preparations were being made to fulfill Trump’s campaign promise to do so.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tStill, any effort is likely to face resistance from teachers unions, which have historically viewed efforts to turn control over to the states skeptically in part because they could funnel funds to private and charter schools staffed by educators without similar certifications. Those unions have historically backed Democratic presidential candidates, making the prospect of collaborating with Trump a long shot.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAbolishing the Department of Education would also be a challenging task. The agency has broad responsibilities: last year it distributed approximately $121 billion in federal grants, loans and work-study programs to nearly 10 million people, according to a fiscal year report. An annual application, known as FAFSA, managed by the agency has also become a fixture in the college application process, used by universities to help determine eligibility for scholarships. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrump has nominated Linda McMahon, the onetime CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment who also ran the Small Business Administration in his first term, to head the agency. McMahon is awaiting confirmation, but the president has already moved to rein in the department, part of a broad assault aimed at reducing government spending and responsibilities and shrinking the size of the federal workforce.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“I told Linda: ‘Linda, I hope you do a great job and put yourself out of a job,’” Trump said Tuesday.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAt least 70 employees were placed on leave at the Education Department in recent days, according to Brittany Holder, a spokesperson for the American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents some staffers at the agency. But that figure only accounts for members and employees who fall under the union, according to Holder, and the actual figure could be higher.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSome Education Department employees put on leave were caught in the administration’s efforts to purge federal workers involved in diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Overall, the department has around 4,200 employees, according to its website.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We are evaluating staffing in line with the commitment to prioritizing meaningful learning ahead of divisive ideology in schools and putting student outcomes above special interests,” Madison Biedermann, an Education Department spokesperson, said in a statement.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDespite longstanding pressure from conservatives to shrink or do away with the Education Department, lawmakers have balked at eliminating it before. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tStill, that pressure has intensified with Trump’s reelection after a campaign in which many issues dealing with education became political flash points, including former President Joe Biden’s student-loan debt relief, and criticism over teachings on race, gender and sexuality in schools.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

There are nearly 2.3 million civilian federal employees, but perhaps half of those — including civilian defense and intelligence employees, postal workers, law enforcement personnel and certain other sensitive positions — are ineligible for the offer.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThose 20,000 employees could also include many people who were already planning to retire in the coming months. An average of 62,000 federal workers have retired each year over the past decade, according to data provided by the US Office of Personnel Management. Some 298,000 employees will become eligible for retirement within the next two years.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnd federal employee unions have urged members to be skeptical of the offers, which they said were not guaranteed. The National Treasury Employees Union said the program was “designed to entice or scare you into resigning,” and the American Federation of Government Employees said the intent was “to turn the federal government into a toxic environment where workers cannot stay even if they want to.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs a result, the Office of Personnel Management has given increasingly detailed guidance on the offer, and put its key terms in writing.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOPM’s acting director and top lawyer also defended the legality of the plan in a memo to agencies Tuesday, assuring employees that any signed departure agreement was “binding on the government.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Were the government to backtrack on its commitments, an employee would be entitled to request a rescission of his or her resignation,” OPM Acting Director Charles Ezell wrote.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThough colloquially known as a “buyout,” the deferred resignation plan is structured differently than those often found in the private sector. Employees have until Thursday to accept and could leave their jobs by the end of February. They’re free to take other jobs as long as they don’t conflict with their continued federal employment. They also have to agree not to sue the government.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p>\r\n\tOne of the next moves in President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's sweeping effort to fire government employees and curtail operations is using the agency that manages thousands of federal employee worksites around the country to cut down on office space.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLast week, regional managers for the General Services Administration, or GSA, received a message from the agency's Washington headquarters to begin terminating leases on all of the roughly 7,500 federal offices nationwide, according to an email shared with The Associated Press by a GSA employee.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe order seems to contradict Trump's own return-to-office mandate for federal employees, adding confusion to what was already a scramble by the GSA to find workspace, internet connections and office building security credentials for employees who had been working remotely for years.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tBut it may reflect the Trump administration's belief that it won't need as many offices due to its efforts to fire employees or encourage them to resign.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHere's what to know about the GSA and how Trump's Republican administration is using it in its pursuit of changes with other federal agencies:</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tWhat is the General Services Administration?</h3>\n<p>\r\n\tAn independent agency, the GSA in essence acts like the federal government's real estate broker, managing federal property for various agencies. President Harry S Truman established the GSA in 1949, streamlining administrative duties of procuring workplaces for federal employees that had to that point been handled by a variety of entities.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tInitially, in the wake of World War II, the GSA was tasked with disposing of war surplus goods and stockpiling strategic supplies for use in wartime. These days, it handles the acquisition of workplaces for more than 1 million federal civilian workers, oversees preservation of hundreds of historic buildings and manages government purchases from commercial vendors.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAs of last fall, the GSA owned and leased more than 363 million square feet of space in 8,397 buildings in more than 2,200 communities nationwide, according to the agency's website. Those properties include courthouses, post offices and data processing centres.</p>\n<h3>\r\n\tWhat does Trump want the GSA to do?</h3>\n<p>\r\n\tMusk and his Department of Government Efficiency have homed in on the GSA.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAn email sent last week from GSA headquarters in Washington instructed regional managers to begin terminating leases on roughly 7,500 federal offices nationwide.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLease terminations are the clear priority at this time, according to a Jan 29 email from a senior GSA manager, a copy of which was provided to the AP by a GSA employee.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn a follow-up meeting, GSA regional managers were told the goal is to terminate as many as 300 leases per day, according to the employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.</p>\n<h3>\r\n\tWho is leading Trump's moves concerning the GSA?</h3>\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to the employee who spoke to the AP, the initiative is being led by Nicole Hollander, who has been embedded in the GSA's headquarters in recent days.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tOn her LinkedIn profile, Hollander describes herself as an X employee with a background in real estate, in the Washington area. Hollander's X account which shows that she joined in March 2015 but where posts date only to September 2023 is full of posts related to X's real estate acquisitions, as well as information about auctions of items from Twitter's former offices after Musk purchased the platform.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTrump has ordered the GSA to make sure it promotes beautiful federal civic architecture as the president dislikes styles that are less traditional.</p>\n<h3>\r\n\tHas Trump had a dustup with the GSA before?</h3>\n<p>\r\n\tYes. During the transition period following his November win, Trump declined to sign an agreement with the GSA that would have given his team access to secure government offices and email accounts. That refusal came in part because it would have required that the then-president-elect limit contributions to $5,000 and reveal who was donating to his transition effort.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIn late November, nearly two months past the deadline, Trump did reach an agreement with President Joe Biden's White House to allow transition staff to coordinate with the existing federal workforce before taking office on Jan 20.</p><p></p></div>",
