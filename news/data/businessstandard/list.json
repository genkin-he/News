On Wednesday, the Nifty 50 index quoted on a flat note around 23,750 levels in a choppy trade. Meanwhile, the broader Nifty 500 index has rallied 5.3 per cent from its low of 20,758, and was seen quoting around 20,820 levels in today's session.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> Technically, the Nifty 50 index was seen favourably placed above its short-term moving average and the super trend line on the daily scale. On the other hand, the Nifty 500 index was seen testing resistance around its super trend line on the daily scale at 23,820, a close above the same will strengthen the trend for the broader index.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> The daily chart shows that the Nifty 500 index is likely to trade with a favourable bias as long as the index holds above 21,475. On the upside, the index can potentially rally to 22,700 levels, with interim resistance seen at 22,000 and 22,250.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> Among individual stocks in the broader market, 65 out of the Nifty 500 stocks have gained over 10 per cent in the last eight days; with 5 surging more than 20 per cent. Beaten down <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/markets/kalyan-jewellers-india-ltd-share-price-42402.html\" target=\"_blank\">Kalyan Jewellers</a> tops the gainers chart with a 29 per cent gain. Syrma SGS Technology, Inox Wind, Westlife Foodworld, Phoenix Mills, DOMS Industries, Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company, TVS Motor, Aptus Value Housing Finance, Aditya Birla Real Estate and UPL were the other major gainers - up over 18 per cent each.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <strong>ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/markets/news/nifty-may-target-24-300-post-budget-trump-tariff-rbi-policy-key-triggers-125020101053_1.html?1738738548\" target=\"_blank\">Nifty may target 24,300 post Budget; Trump tariff, RBI policy key triggers</a></strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> Amid this recent pullback, select stocks are now seen trading in overbought territory on the basis of the RSI indicator. The 14-day RSI (Relative Strength Index) indicator is plotted on a scale of 0 - 100; a reading above 70 implies an overbought position; whereas, a reading below 30 implies oversold zone.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> Just being overbought or oversold does not necessarily mean a likely change in director. The underlying index or stock can also consolidate or trade sideways for the RSI indicator to cool-down. However, analysts do caution on venturing into stocks that are overbought, as they may tend to fall sharper in case of adverse market reaction.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <strong>ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/markets/news/jubilant-food-devyani-will-budget-led-consumption-boost-pop-their-stocks-125020500450_1.html?1738738548\" target=\"_blank\">Jubilant Food, Devyani: Will Budget-led consumption boost pop their stocks?</a></strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/markets/upl-ltd-share-price-2461.html\" target=\"_blank\">UPL</a> and <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/markets/bajaj-finance-ltd-share-price-3722.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bajaj Finance</a> with a 14-day RSI reading above 78 are two leading stocks in the overbought zone among the Nifty 500.

They are wages paid in exchange for services.\"<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\t\"This is a clear sign of America's interventionist policy particularly during the Biden administration, which tried to pressure Iran and meddle in its domestic affairs through financial aid, Bagahei added.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIt remains unclear how funding for Iranian activists and opposition figures would be affected by the USAID decision.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe lion's share of money for civil society in Iran has come through the U.S. State Department's Near East Regional Democracy fund, known by the acronym NERD, which grew as an American response to the Green Movement protests in 2009.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn 2024, the Biden administration requested $65 million for NERD after over $600 million had been appropriated by Congress for the fund, according to the Congressional Research Service. That money and other funding had gone in the past toward training journalists and activists on how to report on human rights abuses, funding access to the internet amid government shutdowns and other issues.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe State Department did not respond to a request for comment over the NERD funding and its future. American officials for years have kept the awardees of NERD grants secret due to what they describe as the risk activists face from Iran, particularly after Iranian intelligence officers have allegedly targeted in kidnapping or assassination plots, US prosecutors say.</p>\n<h3>\r\n\tIran repeatedly hints it's ready to talk to Trump</h3>\n<p>\r\n\tIran also noticed that the US avoided direct criticism of the Islamic Republic during a review by the United Nations Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva last week. For those in Iran's government, there's anticipation this could mean that Trump is willing to negotiate, something he repeatedly brought up in his election campaign as a possibility.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tEven Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, in a speech in September opened the door to talks with the US, saying there is no harm in engaging with the enemy. More recently, he tempered that, warning that sinister plots could still be concealed behind diplomatic smiles.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe must be careful about who we are dealing with, who we are negotiating with, and who we are speaking to,\" Khamenei said last week.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhile Bagahei, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, acknowledged Iran hasn't seen any green light yet for talks, Iran is trying to do everything it can to signal it wants them.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe country's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, who campaigned on outreach to the West, urged officials on Monday to listen to dissent from the Iranian people and avoid further crackdowns like those that followed the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe enemies are hoping that by stirring up disputes within the country, they will throw people into the streets and then ride the wave of protests themselves,\" Pezeshkian said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAs he signed the executive order on Iran on Tuesday, Trump warned the country would be obliterated if he was assassinated by Tehran. But he still left the door open for talks.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tI'm going to sign it, but hopefully we're not going to have to use it very much, he said from the Oval Office. We will see whether or not we can arrange or work out a deal with Iran.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe don't want to be tough on Iran. We don't want to be tough on anybody,\" Trump added. \"But they just can't have a nuclear bomb.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, factions within Iran's theocracy are still likely to oppose talks, whether out of their own self interest or over anger that Trump ordered the 2020 drone strike that killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the country's top general and a revered figure.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThat killing fueled Iranian calls for Trump's assassination and alleged plots against him. In November, the Justice Department disclosed an Iranian murder-for-hire plot to kill Trump. While Iran denied being involved, Tehran has a history of plotting the killing of opponents abroad.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"This will not have any impact on the factions that oppose talks with the U.S. but maybe some moderates find it as an excuse to say that Trump is taking some steps, Iranian political analyst Ahmad Zeiabadi said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFor now though, much of this can seem as conjecture and theorising to many of Iran's over 80 million people who continue to struggle in the grips of the country's ailing economy.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_10-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tTehran taxi driver Gholanhossein Akbari, 27, insisted Iranians like him never benefitted from US support of Iran's pro-democracy activists abroad.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"We did not see any result from the funds the US paid to foreign-based Iranian activists who only make comments in the media, Akbari said.</p><p></p></div>",
