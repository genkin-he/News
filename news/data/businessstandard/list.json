In comparison, the Nifty 50 today was up 0.14 per cent at 23,733.65 at 10:50 AM.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMotilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL), KFin Technologies (KFintech), 360 One Wam, Nuvama Wealth Management, Computer Age Management Services(CAMS), Angel One, Anand Rathi Wealth, and Central Depository Services (India) were up in the range of 3 per cent to 12 per cent. These stocks had corrected up to 40 per cent from their respective 52-week highs.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGiven the low penetration of financial savings and the rising mutual fund folios, as well as demat accounts, analysts expect the growth trajectory of these market intermediaries to continue in the coming years. On the other side, broking industry will also see further consolidation in the hands of the larger players due to many reasons, including increasing compliance costs and norms. Hence, analysts believe the full-service brokerage houses benefit from this consolidation.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"/markets/news/here-s-why-stock-broking-firm-angel-one-share-price-gained-6-in-trade-125020500291_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Here's why stock broking firm Angel One share price gained 6% in trade</a></strong></div></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFY26 Budget, meanwhile, marked a decisive change by offering tax breaks to individuals in the income class earning Rs 12 lakh annually. This will incentivise more people to adopt the new tax regime over old tax regime and thus, tax saving value proposition reduces materially for customers. For capital market players, higher disposable incomes could support systematic investment plan (SIP), future &amp; options (F&amp;O) and cash volumes, analysts at Elara Capital said.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe cut in income taxes, boost to global capability centers in tier II cities, scheme for procurement of pulses and higher interest exemption for senior citizens may stabilise the portfolios of MFI/NBFCs – through repayment of existing liabilities and/or demand for higher loans as disposable incomes rise, the brokerage firm said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAmong individual stocks, MOFSL share price zoomed 12 per cent to Rs 720.55 amid heavy volumes.

Importantly, there will be a higher share of financial savings, allocation to equities, exposure to alternates and greater concentration of wealth.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis, the brokerage firm believes, is really the mega trend that is driving multiple businesses of the Motilal Oswal group, whether it's the asset management business, wealth management business, private wealth business, alternate assets or capital markets.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tShares of KFintech, on the other hand, rallied 9 per cent to Rs 1,201, surging 13 per cent in two days.

The company's consolidated revenue saw a 3 per cent increase, reaching Rs 15,793 crore, up from Rs 15,294 crore in the previous year. Meanwhile, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (Ebitda) rose 7 per cent to Rs 3,481 crore, compared to Rs 3,250 crore in the corresponding period.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equites, adjusting for one-off in Q3FY25 and Q3FY24, <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/companies/results/tata-power-q3-results-net-profit-rises-8-2-to-rs-1-031-cr-revenue-up-5-125020400954_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tata Power's net profits</a> saw a 9 per cent Y-o-Y growth, falling short of their estimates. Meanwhile, the company’s renewable business PAT grew 60 per cent Y-o-Y  led by manufacturing income from the newly built 4.3GW solar module and cell plant. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn the revenue front, however, the renewable energy (RE) segment fell 15 per cent Y-o-Y, but the transmission &amp; distribution segment rose 5 per cent Y-o-Y, while power generation revenues were largely flat on a Y-o-Y basis, analysts at Elara Capital noted. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We remain optimistic on Tata Power's long-term RE transition (65 per cent mix by FY28), solar manufacturing (50 per cent external by FY27) and optionality in solar rooftops, nuclear endeavours and potential UP Discom acquisition. While Tata Power is targeting 2.5x its FY24 PAT to Rs 100 billion by FY30, we fear most of this growth is back-ended with RE fully contributing by FY28,” Subhadip Mitra, Vikram Datwani, and CFA Vijay Bhasin Of Nuvama Institutional Equities said in a report.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe brokerage added that it finds risks outweighing rewards as the current market price of Tata Power stock more than bakes in these triggers, given its valuation of 23 times its FY26 price to earnings (PE) ratio.
