            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\n<strong>By Andy Mukherjee</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tFor multinationals looking to reduce their reliance on China, the top alternative locations in Asia so far have been Vietnam and Indonesia. Both economies have witnessed a boom in exports and foreign investments over the past few years. But now someone new wants to play: Singapore. To gauge the city’s seriousness, look no further than to its largest lender. <small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tDBS Group Holdings Ltd. may want to purchase 29 per cent of Alliance Bank Malaysia Bhd., one of the country’s smallest publicly traded banks, from its top investor. It may even consider raising the stake to 49 per cent, Bloomberg News has reported. If the Malaysian monetary authority approves the proposal, DBS will be able to upgrade its presence, currently restricted to a branch serving corporate clients, to full-fledged banking operations.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe motivation is plain to see. The Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone, greenlighted recently by Malaysia’s Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and Singapore’s Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, could shape up as “an ideal candidate” for companies attempting to diversify supply chains away from mainland China, say economists at ANZ Group Holdings Ltd. Indeed, it’s the prospect of this economic zone that may be “increasing the urgency” for DBS to gain a firmer foothold in Malaysia, analysts for CreditSights, a Fitch Group unit, note. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBut why has DBS, no slouch when it comes to building franchises in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and India, done so little in a market that’s geographically and culturally the closest to its home turf? </div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThat answer lies in history. Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. and United Overseas Bank Ltd., two of the three local Singaporean banks, were established in the 1930s British Malaya. They rank among the top 10 banks in Malaysia. DBS came into being in 1968, three years after the city’s acrimonious exit from the Malaysian federation. So it faced a problem expanding in the neighbouring economy — not because it didn’t want to, but because it wasn’t welcome. “The Malaysians have always said there are already two big Singapore banks over there, why do we need a third one?” Piyush Gupta, the outgoing chief executive of DBS, said on an earnings call in November. “With the current administration, there might be a bit more flexibility.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe reason Malaysians may be rethinking their stance is that they see a once-in-a-generation chance to build an alternative to Shenzhen, a fishing village in southern China turned into an economic powerhouse in less than half a century. Hong Kong drove the success of the Shenzhen special economic zone by routing financial capital to it, a role that Singapore can reprise. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThere was a time when Singapore was competitive in large-scale manufacturing. No longer. Services — especially finance — have guided its economic destiny over the past two decades. The city-state is nine times richer than Vietnam or Indonesia. With a population of 6 million, and just about 300 square miles of land, the island lacks the natural resources to plug itself back into global supply chains.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThat’s where its larger northern neighbour comes in. At $500 a month, wages in the southernmost Malaysian state of Johor are a seventh of Singapore. Johor is 26 times bigger than Singapore by land area, and every day 300,000 people use the six-lane, 100-year-old causeway connecting them, making it one of the busiest land crossings in the world. A light-rail shuttle link, coming up by next year, will allow easy immigration clearance. Harmonising customs procedures will ease the flow of goods.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHong Kong’s proximity to Shenzhen has always made Singapore fret about what it’s lacking: a low-cost hinterland. A couple of Indonesian islands where Singaporean government-linked companies set up industrial enclaves failed to make a meaningful impression on the city-state’s economy. Singapore tried to narrow the gap with Hong Kong in 1994 with Suzhou Industrial Park, its first government-to-government project in China. It didn’t quite work as intended. Then, about 10 years ago, the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh lured the Singaporeans to help build a new capital city complete with manufacturing hubs, universities and skyscrapers. But the state’s chief minister lost power, and his successor scrapped the plan. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe most obvious choice for a hinterland has always been to Singapore’s north. But there, history — and personalities — got in the way. Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia’s prime minister from 1981 to 2003, promptly withdrew support to a high-speed train project between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore when he returned to power between 2018 to 2020. The 99-year-old leader’s departure from the political scene has opened a new window of trust. The aborted high-speed link is expected to get revived.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAn even stronger indicator of cooperation is coming from bankers.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Alliance Bank stake that DBS might want is currently with a Malaysian holding company, 49 per cent owned by Singaporean state investor Temasek Holdings Pte, which also controls roughly 32 per cent of DBS. A deal, backed by Temasek and blessed by the Malaysian central bank, will signal that authorities on both sides are keen to gatecrash the so-called China+1 party. Kuala Lumpur has already thrown in a concessional 5 per cent corporate tax rate for the first 15 years. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDBS can help bring financing to projects inside the zone, which may also be able to ride the benefits of Singapore’s bilateral free-trade agreements with the US, the EU and the UK, ANZ economists note. Johor is already flooded with data-center investments by the likes of Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. To ramp up its appeal, the state will have to draw talent from other parts of the country — and from around the world.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThat’s Malaysia’s challenge. Singapore will welcome a new group of affluent customers, arriving passport-free to its restaurants and malls over the weekends. As long it keeps its own immigration policy tight, locals won’t have to worry about more competition for jobs. Little wonder then that fresh infrastructure for the zone includes plans for something crucial to its success: an airconditioned travellator along the causeway.  <small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<hr/>\n<div>\r\n\t\tDisclaimer: This is a Bloomberg Opinion piece, and these are the personal opinions of the writer.

This came after the pharma company delivered robust third quarter results for the financial year 2024-25 (Q3FY25), surprising the street on its margin and net profit performance driven by an improved product mix and a lower tax rate due to the company’s transition to the new tax regime. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile most brokerages remained optimistic about the company’s growth trajectory, some once again raised concerns over valuation and the stock’s potential upside, as seen in previous quarters.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDivis Laboratories share price surged 5.36 per cent at Rs 6,205 per share on the BSE in the intraday trade of Tuesday. </div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Q3 growth was led by its Custom Synthesis (CS) business that grew for the eighth quarter in a row, up 42 per cent year-on-year, and contributing 53 per cent to the revenues, followed by generics business adding 40 per cent and growing 7 per cent Y-o-Y. Nutraceuticals also grew 10 per cent Y-o-Y, contributing 7 per cent to the sales. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The company indicated ongoing efforts to add new products/clients, which we have been highlighting through our monthly data series. GLP-1 remains a growth opportunity while it also expects margin benefits in the mid-term due to backward integration at Kakinada.

With zero tax liability for those earning below Rs 12 lakh and substantial tax savings of up to Rs 1.1 lakh for high earners, the proposed changes encourage individuals to opt for the simplified structure. If you fall within the affected income range, consider assessing your tax planning strategy to maximise savings under the new structure,\" said Value Research in a note.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Other key changes:</strong></div>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tLimit of Total Income for Rebate u/s 87A has been increased from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- under new regime and in consequently the Limit of Rebate enhanced from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs.60,000/- (except for income taxed at special rates).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tUnder the new tax regime, Section 87A tax rebate will not available on any special rate income (such as S. 111A, 112 etc). Whereas, for the old tax regime, Section 87A tax rebate is still available on special rate income like STCG covered in Section 111A,LTCG covered in Section 112. Section 87A Rebate was never available on long term capital gain on equity (covered in Section 112A) under both regimes and no changes are made in the budget for the same.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tLimit of TDS on interest for senior citizens increased from Rs. 50,000/- to Rs. 1,00,000/- which will provide greater financial relief to retirees. Further, Limit on Rent enhanced from Rs. 2,40,000/- to Rs.6,00,000/- benefitting small tax payers earning rental income.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tTime limit to file updated return increased from 2 to 4 Years which will allow taxpayers correcting errors or omissions or allows to file ITR if they have not filed ITR.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tPeriod of Registration of smaller trusts has been increased from 5 to 10 Years on the condition that Total income without giving tax benefit does not exceed Rs. 5 Crore during preceding 2 years.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t As per NPS Vatsalaya scheme Started from 18th September 2024, parents/guardian can open account for minor child future benefit. It is now proposed to provide deduction u/s 80CCD(1B) of Rs.50,000 for contribution made to NPS Vatsalya Account which will be similar to deduction available as per current provisions for employer contribution to NPS available under new old regime.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tProvision of higher TDS rate will be applicable only in case PAN is not available and accordingly, provision of higher TDS on payment to non-filers (of return of income)</div>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tis removed.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tThe TCS threshold on remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) has been raised from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 10 lakh and no TCS will be applicable on goods but TDS on sale goods will continue to apply.

The net result for the Nifty remains tepid. The NSE data shows that the Nifty February futures has gained 0.1 per cent in this period, while the open interest (OI) has declined by 1 per cent.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> Interestingly, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been net sellers in the last three trading sessions in index futures in the derivatives segment; with net sales of 11,108 contracts.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> As per the NSE derivatives data, FIIs long-short ratio in index futures is at the lowest point at 0.12 in more than a year. This ratio implies that FIIs now hold 8.5 short bets in index futures for every long position. In comparison, for much of the January series FIIs were seen holding 5 short positions in index futures for every long bet.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> Meanwhile, among other participants retail investors' long-short ratio in index futures stand at 2.5; proprietary trades at 1.8 and domestic institutional investors (DIIs) at 1.4.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <strong>ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/markets/news/nifty-metal-eyes-15-fall-if-it-breaks-7-900-these-stocks-may-be-worst-hit-125020300361_1.html?1738639343\" target=\"_blank\">Nifty Metal eyes 15% fall if it breaks 7,900; these stocks may be worst hit</a></strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> On Monday, the NSE Nifty slipped 0.5 per cent amid the global sell-off in a volatile trading session.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <strong>Technical outlook on Nifty</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> Technically, despite of high volatility, the Nifty defended its 21-day Simple Moving Average (21-DSMA) support and formed a hammer candle on a daily scale, indicating strength, says Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C. Mehta Investment Interrmediates.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> The 21-DSMA is placed near 23,270 levels, which will act as immediate support for index followed by 23,000 levels, while 23,640 will serve as short-term resistance for index. As long as the index holds 23,000, traders are advised to follow a buy-on-dips strategy, the analyst said in a note.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <strong>Stocks with long-short bets</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> According to the NSE derivatives data, United Breweries (UBL), HFCL and ITC are the three stocks with significant long build-up. Data shows that <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/markets/united-breweries-ltd-share-price-23220.html\" target=\"_blank\">UBL stock</a> futures has gained nearly 6 per cent in the first three trading sessions of February, while the OI has increased by almost 67 per cent; thus implying likely long build-up.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> Similarly, HFCL and ITC have rallied around 5 per cent each in the same period, while the OI have risen by 50.6 per cent and 42.3 per cent, respectively.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <strong>ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/markets/news/itc-zomato-bata-india-5-stocks-to-buy-for-upto-22-gain-post-budget-2025-125020100822_1.html?1738639343\" target=\"_blank\">ITC, Zomato, Bata India: 5 stocks to buy for up to 22% gain post Budget 2025</a></strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> On the other hand, HUDCO has seen a notable short build-up, with the February stock contract down 7 per cent alongside a near 87 per cent surge in OI. Engineering major, ABB has slumped almost 15 per cent in these three days, while the OI has shot-up by 56 per cent. Thus, implying likely short build-up at these counters.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> Among others, there are 8 F&amp;O stocks which have witnessed an over 5 per cent fall in the first three trading sessions of the February series, coupled with significant rise in OI. APL Apollo, NCC, IRFC, Larsen &amp; Toubro (L&amp;T), Jindal Stainless, JSW Energy, HPCL and Ambuja Cement are the 8 stock futures.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small><br/></div>",
