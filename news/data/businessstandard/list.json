However, farm equipment and auto businesses together are the key revenue and profitability drivers for it.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tM&amp;M continued with its outperformance in the domestic passenger vehicle (PV) space, with total sales growing 17.6 per cent year-on-year (YoY), to 50,659 units in January 2025.

Further, continued government support on various rural schemes and on Agri subsidies are positives that may boost tractor demand going forward, according to the management.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile, the government has announced the biggest ever overhaul in personal income tax structure, thereby increasing the tax exempt income from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 12 lakh in the Union Budget 2025-26. This tax relief is expected to increase the disposable income, between the range of Rs 30,000 and 110,000, in the hands of taxpayers, thereby providing a big booster for the auto space given people will upgrade their standard of living by potentially buying new vehicles which can either be a 2-wheeler or PV, ICICI Securities said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFurther, a better outlook for the rural segment and the coming of Chaitra Navratri in March-end 2025 would support tractor sales in Q4FY25.

However, the brokerage firm believes that the automobiles segment would substantially contribute to profitability in the coming period. Mirae Asset Sharekhan maintains 'Buy' rating on the stock with an SOTP-based revised price target of Rs 3,600, due to healthy traction in its PV segment, market leadership in the tractor segment, opportunity to grow in the farm machinery segment, and its roadmap to play in the electric vehicle (EV) space.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small></div>",
