Offering his views on the team’s key players, Raina highlighted the roles of Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Ravindra Jadeja in India’s quest for success.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Rohit Sharma: The Aggressive Leader</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRaina emphasised the importance of Rohit maintaining his attacking mindset as both a batter and captain. \"I think Rohit should play aggressively. You saw how he batted in the ODI World Cup—he was attacking even in the final. That approach is vital,\" said Raina.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/cricket/champions-trophy/points-table\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Check ICC Champions Trophy 2025 points table here</strong></a></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPraising Rohit’s leadership, he added, \"Rohit is an attacking captain. The way he utilises his bowlers, like bringing in Mohammad Shami during critical phases or strategically using spinners, is commendable. This could be his last ICC trophy as captain. Winning the Champions Trophy would make him the first Indian player to win four ICC trophies—a phenomenal feat.\"</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRaina also pointed out Rohit’s recent batting transformation. \"After the ODI World Cup, his strike rate has soared to 119-120. When Rohit scores, it amplifies his captaincy as well. Scoring runs will be crucial for him to lead India effectively.\"</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Virat Kohli: A Master of White-Ball Cricket</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\tRaina expressed confidence in Virat Kohli’s ability to deliver in the upcoming series. \"When it comes to white-ball cricket, Virat knows how to switch on and switch off. His record against England is unmatched, and playing at high-scoring venues like Nagpur, Ahmedabad, and Cuttack will elevate his energy levels,\" Raina said.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/cricket/champions-trophy\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Check latest news on ICC Champions Trophy 2025 here</strong></a></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe also emphasized the complementary relationship between Rohit and Virat. \"Both have the skill to score big runs.

Kuldeep Yadav is returning from injury, and Axar Patel has been in great form. The pitches in Dubai may offer seam movement, but spin will be critical. Kuldeep, Axar, and Jadeja must be at their best,\" he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tRaina concluded by underscoring the importance of team balance. \"Rohit’s choice of team combination will play a crucial role in these matches and the tournament ahead.\"</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs India prepares to face England, Raina’s words shed light on the key players and strategies that could define the team's success in both the ODI series and the Champions Trophy.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/cricket/champions-trophy/schedule\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Check ICC Champions Trophy 2025 full schedule, match timings (IST) here</strong></a></div><div id=\"between_article_content_10-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",

Both carriers are conventionally powered and utilise ski-jump ramps for aircraft take-offs. INS Vikrant, India's first indigenous carrier, was built by Cochin Shipyard Ltd, while INS Vikramaditya, originally from Russia, has been in service since 2014.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEach carrier can accommodate 25-30 fixed-wing aircraft along with 10 helicopters.

The proposed carrier was designed to accommodate a 54-fighter air wing, with considerations reportedly given to nuclear propulsion and electromagnetic catapults.

Aircraft carriers are seen as capital-intensive assets, not only due to their own costs but also because of the expenses associated with the Carrier Battle Group and fighter aircraft.
