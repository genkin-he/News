The pharmaceutical company guided for net debt of Rs 2,100 crore/1,750 crore by FY25/H1FY26 as against Rs 3,000 crore as of FY24.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile, the board of directors of Eris is scheduled to meet on Friday, February 07, 2025, to consider the declaration of interim dividend for the financial year 2024-25. </div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"In the event of the declaration of interim dividend as aforesaid, the proposed record date for the purpose of determining the members eligible for receiving the said interim dividend shall be Monday, February 10, 2025,\" Eris said in an exchange filing.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAt 11:46 AM, Eris Life share price was quoting 11 per cent higher at Rs 1,363.35, as compared to 0.22 per cent decline in the BSE Sensex. The stock had hit a record high of Rs 1,593 on December 11, 2024. </div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn Q3FY25, Eris reported 42.6 per cent Y-o-Y growth in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) at Rs 250 crore. Margins, however, contracted to 34.4 per cent from 36.1 per cent.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Y-o-Y impact on gross margins was largely on account of change in product and business mix due to integration of new businesses. Depreciation and finance charges came in higher due to consolidation of new businesses. Resultant profit after tax came in at Rs 87 crore, down 14.3 per cent Y-o-Y.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEris Life has opted for an inorganic route to diversify and scale up its existing portfolio. This has been implemented without diluting margins. Analysts at PL Capital, thus, expect margins to sustain at over 35 per cent as revenue scales up from recent acquisitions, which are currently operating at sub-optimal profitability. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"The company has multiple growth levers such as broad-based offerings in the derma segment, opportunities in the cardiometabolic market with patent expirations and benefits of operating leverage, as revenue scales up from these acquisitions,\" the brokerage firm said in its result update report. It maintained its 'buy' rating on Eris Life stock with a revised target price of Rs 1,450 per share.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEris Lifesciences is engaged in the manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. The company holds a dominant position in key specialty areas such as Diabetologists, Cardiologists, Neurologists, Gynecologists, Dermatologists and Consulting Physicians. The company derives 40 per cent of Branded Formulations revenue from seven emerging specialties of Dermatology, Insulins, Women’s Health, CNS, Oncology, Critical Care and Nephrology, giving us significant headroom for disruptive growth in these segments.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"The acquisition of Swiss Parenterals and Biocon's domestic branded formulations business will provide a strong launch platform to make deeper inroads in the Indian Injectables market. A number of major molecules will lose exclusivity in the cardio metabolic segment in the next 3-5 years. On the back of its established position in this market, Eris is well positioned to leverage these opportunities as has been demonstrated over the last 3 years with Top-5 market positions in several molecules,\" the company said in its Annual Report.</div></div>",

More than half the voters surveyed by AP VoteCast said support for transgender rights in government and society has gone too far.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe leaned into the rhetoric before the election, pledging to get rid of the transgender insanity, though his campaign offered little in the way of details.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tWednesday's order which coincides with National Girls and Women in Sports Day will involve how his administration will interpret Title IX, the law best known for its role in pursuing gender equity in athletics and preventing sexual harassment on campuses.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThis executive order restores fairness, upholds Title IX's original intent, and defends the rights of female athletes who have worked their whole lives to compete at the highest levels, said US Rep. Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEvery administration has the authority to issue its own interpretations of the landmark legislation. The last two presidential administrations including Trump's first offer a glimpse at the push-pull involved.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBetsy DeVos, the education secretary during Trump's first term, issued a Title IX policy in 2020 that narrowed the definition of sexual harassment and required colleges to investigate claims only if they're reported to certain officials.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Biden administration rolled back that policy last April with one of its own that stipulated the rights of LGBTQ+ students would be protected by federal law and provided new safeguards for victims of campus sexual assault. The policy stopped short of explicitly addressing transgender athletes. Still, more than a half-dozen Republican-led states immediately challenged the new rule in court.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAll Trump has to say is, We are going to read the regulation traditionally,' said Doriane Lambelet Coleman, a professor at Duke Law School.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHow this order could affect the transgender athlete population a number that is incredibly difficult to pin down is uncertain.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Associated Press reported in 2021 that in many cases, the states introducing a ban on transgender athletes could not cite instances where their participation was an issue. When Utah state legislators overrode a veto by Gov. Spencer Cox in 2022, the state had only one transgender girl playing in K-12 sports who would be affected by the ban. It did not regulate participation for transgender boys.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis is a solution looking for a problem, Cheryl Cooky, a professor at Purdue University who studies the intersection of gender, sports, media and culture, told the AP after Trump was elected.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYet the actual number of transgender athletes seems to be almost immaterial. Any case of a transgender female athlete competing or even believed to be competing draws outsized attention, from Lia Thomas swimming for the University of Pennsylvania to the recently completed season of the San Jose State volleyball team.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",

The company's board members are expected to meet soon to deliberate on the next steps regarding the potential partnership.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIf called off, the decision would cast doubt on a deal that could have formed the world's third-largest automaker by sales. It also raises concerns about Nissan’s ability to navigate its ongoing financial and operational challenges without external support.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNews of the possible breakdown in talks had a positive impact on both companies' stock prices. On Wednesday, Honda’s shares rose over 2 per cent, while Nissan’s gained 1.6  per cent , contrasting with a slight dip in the broader Nikkei 225 index.  </div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tMerger talks faced growing differences  </h3>\n<div>\r\n\tHonda and Nissan, Japan's second- and third-largest automakers, respectively, announced last year that they were exploring a merger amid intensifying competition from China's BYD and emerging electric vehicle manufacturers. However, discussions have reportedly been strained by increasing disagreements, the news report said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNissan’s board is now set to review the situation following Honda’s suggestion that Nissan operate as its subsidiary — a move that deviates from the initial terms of their discussions, one source revealed.  </div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tHonda’s concerns over Nissan’s turnaround  </h3>\n<div>\r\n\tWith a market value nearly five times greater than Nissan’s, Honda has expressed concerns about its smaller rival’s progress in executing its turnaround strategy, a source noted.  </div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEarlier, Japan's Asahi Shimbun reported that the merger was at risk of falling apart.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNissan has faced significant challenges in adapting to the shift toward electric vehicles, struggling to recover from years of turmoil following the arrest of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn in 2018.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCompounding these difficulties, the company also faces potential trade disruptions, particularly from proposed US tariffs under former President Donald Trump. Analysts believe such tariffs could impact Nissan more severely than Honda or Toyota, given its reliance on production in Mexico.  </div>\n<h3>\r\n\tRenault's stance on the merger  </h3>\n<div>\r\n\tRenault, Nissan’s long-time alliance partner, had previously indicated openness to a potential deal with Honda. The French automaker holds a 36 per cent stake in Nissan, including 18.7 per cent through a French trust.  </div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\n<strong>Titan share price:</strong> Watch and eyewear brand Titan share price took a hit on Wednesday, February 5, 2025, falling as much as 3.53 per cent to an intraday low of Rs 3,472.05 per share despite reporting a decent overall performance for Q3FY25. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe primary concern weighing on the Titan share was weaker-than-expected margin in Q3 results, analysts said. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDomestic brokerage InCred Equities cited weaker-than-expected margin in Q3 in its ‘First Cut’ note. The brokerage, however, maintained an ‘Add’ rating with a target price of Rs 3,840. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThose at Motilal Oswal, too, noted while revenue growth was strong, margins were impacted by a lower studded share and a contraction in gross margin. Therefore, they maintained a ‘Buy’ rating with a target price of Rs 3,588. </div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTitan’s Ebitda margin contracted 170 basis points (bps) to 9.4 per cent in Q3FY25, from 11.1 per cent in the same quarter the previous year (Q3FY24). However, Ebitda grew 7 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) to Rs 1,674 crore, from Rs 1,565 crore in Q3FY24. </div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAmong other brokerages, JM Financial retained a ‘Hold’ rating, highlighting strong jewellery demand but noting margin pressure. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGlobal brokerages, meanwhile, remained positive on Titan. Goldman Sachs reportedly maintained a ‘Buy’ rating with a target price of Rs 3,900. Macquarie kept an ‘Outperform’ rating, with a target price of Rs 4,150. Similarly, Morgan Stanley maintained an ‘Overweight’ rating on the company, with a target price of Rs 3,876.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOverall, Titan’s profit remained nearly flat, at Rs 1,047 crore, compared to Rs 1,053 crore a year ago, while revenue surged 25.2 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 17,740 crore, up from Rs 14,164 crore in Q3FY24. The growth in revenue was driven by strong performances in the jewellery and eyecare segments.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Titan Q3 results (segment-wise)</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe jewellery division posted a strong total income of Rs 14,697 crore, growing 26 per cent over Q3FY24. The India business itself grew 25 per cent during the same period. The festive quarter boosted consumer demand, with secondary sales growing 28 per cent, wedding-related purchases up by 29 per cent, and same-store sales growing by 22 per cent. Gold jewellery and coins continued to perform well, with a 27 per cent growth compared to the previous year. The Ebit margin for the jewellery division stood at 9.5 per cent, and after normalising for the impact of custom duties, the margin improved to 11.2 per cent. During the quarter, the company expanded its presence by opening 11 new Tanishq stores and 13 Mia stores in the domestic market.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe watches and wearables division recorded a total income of Rs 1,128 crore, reflecting a 15 per cent increase over Q3FY24. The domestic business grew 14 per cent during the same period, with the analog segment seeing a robust 20 per cent growth. Titan brand itself recorded an 18 per cent increase, while international brands saw a 30 per cent growth in retail sales. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, the wearables segment saw a 20 per cent decline, with both average selling prices and volumes decreasing 8 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively. Ebit for the division was Rs 111 crore, with a margin of 9.8 per cent. The company added 23 new stores, including 12 Titan World stores, 10 Helios stores, and 1 Fastrack store.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEyecare showed promising growth, with total income rising 16 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 194 crore. International brand sales grew 56 per cent, while sunglasses sales outpaced other product categories, growing 35 per cent. Frames and lenses also posted solid growth in the mid-double digits. The division recorded an Ebit of Rs 21 crore, with a margin of 10.8 per cent. During the quarter, Titan Eye+ opened 3 new stores.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn the international front, Titan's jewellery business in North America grew 64 per cent, fuelled by new store openings and solid regional demand. The international presence of Tanishq expanded with two new stores in Dubai and Seattle, bringing the global count to 20 stores (18 Tanishq and 2 Mia). Titan Eye+ also made strides with four international locations.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe festive quarter firmly established a strong growth trajectory for FY25, after a subdued Q1 and healthy Q2. C K Venkataraman, managing director of Titan, noted that the quarter saw the strongest jewellery performance yet for the fiscal year, with retail growth in gold, watches, and eyewear. Despite the profitability being impacted by customs duties, the company is focused on scaling its businesses, especially emerging ones, and remains optimistic for a strong finish to FY25.</div></div>",
