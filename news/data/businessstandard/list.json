It's not living up to that potential right now. ... They've got to get their act together.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tHe said the UN needs to be fair to countries that deserve fairness, adding that there are some countries, which he didn't name, that are outliers, that are very bad and they're being almost preferred.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBefore Trump's announcement, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric reiterated the Human Rights Council's importance and UNRWA's work in delivering critical services to Palestinians.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTrump also pulled the US out of the Human Rights Council in June 2018. His ambassador to the UN at the time, Nikki Haley, accused the council of chronic bias against Israel and pointed to what she said were human rights abusers among its members.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tPresident Joe Biden renewed support for the Human Rights Council, and the US won a seat on the 47-nation body in October 2021. But the Biden administration announced in late September that the United States would not seek a second consecutive term.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTrump's order on Tuesday has little concrete effect because the United States is already not a council member, said council spokesperson Pascal Sim. But like all other UN member countries, the US automatically has informal observer status and will still have a seat in the council's ornate round chamber at the UN complex in Geneva.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tUNRWA was established by the UN General Assembly in 1949 to provide assistance for Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes before and during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war that followed Israel's establishment, as well as for their descendants. It provides aid, education, health care and other services to some 2.5 million Palestinians in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as 3 million more in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tBefore the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, UNRWA ran schools for Gaza's 650,000 children as well as health facilities, and helped deliver humanitarian aid. It has continued to provide health care and been key to the delivery of food and other aid to Palestinians during the war.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe first Trump administration suspended funding to UNRWA in 2018, but Biden restored it. The U.S. had been the biggest donor to the agency, providing it with $343 million in 2022 and $422 million in 2023.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFor years, Israel has accused UNRWA of anti-Israeli bias in its education materials, which the agency denies.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIsrael alleged that 19 of UNRWA's 13,000 staff in Gaza participated in the Hamas attacks. They were terminated pending a UN investigation, which found nine may have been involved.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIn response, 18 governments froze funding to the agency, but all have since restored support except the United States. Legislation ratifying the US decision halted any American funding to UNRWA until March 2025, and Trump's action Tuesday means it will not be restored.</p><p></p></div>",

It's not living up to that potential right now. ... They've got to get their act together.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tHe said the UN needs to be fair to countries that deserve fairness, adding that there are some countries, which he didn't name, that are outliers, that are very bad and they're being almost preferred.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBefore Trump's announcement, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric reiterated the Human Rights Council's importance and UNRWA's work in delivering critical services to Palestinians.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTrump also pulled the US out of the Human Rights Council in June 2018. His ambassador to the UN at the time, Nikki Haley, accused the council of chronic bias against Israel and pointed to what she said were human rights abusers among its members.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tPresident Joe Biden renewed support for the Human Rights Council, and the US won a seat on the 47-nation body in October 2021. But the Biden administration announced in late September that the United States would not seek a second consecutive term.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTrump's order on Tuesday has little concrete effect because the United States is already not a council member, said council spokesperson Pascal Sim. But like all other UN member countries, the US automatically has informal observer status and will still have a seat in the council's ornate round chamber at the UN complex in Geneva.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tUNRWA was established by the UN General Assembly in 1949 to provide assistance for Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes before and during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war that followed Israel's establishment, as well as for their descendants. It provides aid, education, health care and other services to some 2.5 million Palestinians in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as 3 million more in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tBefore the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, UNRWA ran schools for Gaza's 650,000 children as well as health facilities, and helped deliver humanitarian aid. It has continued to provide health care and been key to the delivery of food and other aid to Palestinians during the war.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe first Trump administration suspended funding to UNRWA in 2018, but Biden restored it. The U.S. had been the biggest donor to the agency, providing it with $343 million in 2022 and $422 million in 2023.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFor years, Israel has accused UNRWA of anti-Israeli bias in its education materials, which the agency denies.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIsrael alleged that 19 of UNRWA's 13,000 staff in Gaza participated in the Hamas attacks. They were terminated pending a UN investigation, which found nine may have been involved.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIn response, 18 governments froze funding to the agency, but all have since restored support except the United States. Legislation ratifying the US decision halted any American funding to UNRWA until March 2025, and Trump's action Tuesday means it will not be restored.</p><p></p></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to cut interest rates for the first time in nearly five years in Governor Sanjay Malhotra’s first monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting on Wednesday.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe meeting of the six-member MPC, which will culminate on Friday, aims to boost sluggish economic growth, which is seen falling to a four-year low. Malhotra took charge as the 26th RBI governor in December. The government is yet to announce an economist deputy governor in the RBI after Michael Patra’s term ended in mid-January. An economist deputy governor takes charge of the monetary policy department and hence a member of the monetary policy committee. Following Patra’s exit, the monetary policy department is now under M Rajeshwar Rao who looks after regulation, among others. </div></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“Markets will be closely monitoring the statement of the newly appointed RBI governor, and we expect the policy statement to have a dovish undertone even while remaining cautious on the global front,” economists at CareEdge Ratings said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThey expect a rate cut of 25 basis points (bps), while retaining a neutral stance. “We anticipate that the RBI could revise its growth projections of 6.6 per cent for FY25 marginally downwards to bring it in line with the First Advance Estimate (FAE).” The FAE projects GDP growth to slow to 6.4 per cent in FY25 compared to 8.2 per cent growth in FY24.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe RBI emphasised on the need for headline inflation reaching the 4 per cent target for any rate action and highlighted the slow pace of the last mile disinflation. Headline inflation sprinted above 5 per cent in the past four months, while core inflation was relatively stable. The rate cut cycle could be shallow given the inflation concerns, particularly the sharp depreciation of the rupee in recent times. “We are expecting a dovish tone, and a shallow rate cut cycle because we have to look in the context of how much the RBI has raised rates, it was 250 bps, so there is not much room to cut interest rate,” said Sakshi Gupta, principal economist at HDFC Bank. “A 50 bps to 75 basis points rate cut should be able to achieve the neutral rate,” Gupta said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe rupee has come under pressure in recent months, the first after the rate cut by the US Federal Reserve in September, and then the return of Donald Trump as the US President with the threat of imposing import tariffs. The rupee depreciated 1.31 per cent in December and 1.26 per cent in January. “The rupee is under pressure, and with the ongoing strength of the dollar, further depreciation is likely. While a rate cut could weigh on the rupee, the broader weakness in emerging market currencies, driven by external factors like Trump's trade policies, is impacting the rupee,” said the treasury head at a private bank.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“The MPC will likely focus more on the inflation-growth dynamics rather than currency factors, with currency weakness being influenced more by global trade tensions,” the treasury head added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tRBI’s intervention in the foreign exchange market to curb also made the liquidity situation tight, prompting measures like open market operation to purchase bonds to ease the situation. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tA section of market participants expects clarity on the liquidity issue since the system is still in deficit.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\"I expect a rate cut along with some clarity on the proposed liquidity guidelines. While a rate cut could impact the rupee, external factors are already influencing its movement, and growth remains a key concern,\" said Anshul Chandak, head of treasury at RBL Bank.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tRBI had reduced banks’ cash reserve ratio requirement by 50 bps to 4 per cent in the December policy, which released Rs 1.16 trillion. A further Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) cut is not seen in the February policy.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\"We expect the central bank to prioritise durable liquidity infusion, primarily through OMO and bond buy-sell mechanisms, rather than a CRR cut—at least not in February,” said Gaura Sen Gupta, chief economist at IDFC FIRST Bank.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“However, a CRR cut later in the year cannot be ruled out if additional liquidity is needed,” she said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe latest data shows the liquidity deficit fell to Rs 1.08 trillion on Monday, from over Rs 3 trillion before the RBI announced measures like open market operation.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div style=\"float:left\">\n<span class=\"fixed-height-container\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box;display:block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0\"><img alt=\"Chart\" class=\"zoomimg\" data-nimg=\"fill\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;background-size:cover;background-position:0% 0%;filter:blur(20px);background-image:url(\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNk0AAAAC4AKhMfIC0AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\")'/><noscript><img alt=\"Chart\" class=\"zoomimg\" data-nimg=\"fill\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2025-02/04/full/1738691911-1434.jpg\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%\"/></noscript></span></span></div>\n</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
