            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tThe Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai)'s decision to open up several 5G high-band or millimetre wave (mmWave) spectrum will not compensate for the lack of 5G spectrum in mid-bands (1-6 GHz), telco officials said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe government needs to free up at least an additional 1200 MHz of spectrum to allocate a total of 2 GHz of radio waves across the mid-band, and especially in the 6 GHz band for mobile telephony, private sector telco officials told Business Standard.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn Tuesday, Trai recommended spectrum in the 37-37.5 GHz and 37.5-40 GHz frequency ranges should be auctioned, while it has recommended against auctions for the 42.5-43.5 GHz frequency range.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMmwave or spectrum bands above 24 gigahertz (GHz) are a valuable resource when targeting densely populated urban areas. The high band offers an opportunity for service providers to offer unprecedented peak rates, low latency, and high capacity. But this isn't enough, telcos believe.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"High bands like the 37.5 GHz band have certain targeted use cases for 5G. But its limitations include not being able to travel as far as mid and low-band signals, and being more susceptible to interference. On a national level, access to the 6GHz band is required for large-scale 5G coverage,\" a private sector telco official said.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe pointed to a report by the global mobile industry body GSM Association (GSMA), arguing India can save as much as $10 billion annually in 5G network deployment through the use of 6 GHz spectrum.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAn official at another telco echoed Jio's earlier submission to Trai that the entire 6 GHz band should be earmarked for telecom purposes, so that around 300-400 MHz are available to each of the telecom operators for the growth of 5G and the introduction of 6G services.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe 6 GHz band represents the largest block of unused spectrum and is being fought over by telcos and tech companies.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Cellular Operators Association of India (Coai), which counts Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, and Vodafone Idea among its members, has said only 720 MHz is available in the mid-band in India.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndia needs an additional 2 GHz of mid-band spectrum to meet the international standard of 'IMT-2020' user experience to ensure data rates of 100 megabit per second (mbps) on downlink and 50 mbps on an uplink in densely-populated cities, it recently said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile, the Broadband India Forum (BIF), which represents tech majors like Google, Meta, and Microsoft and telecom equipment makers such as Ericsson, Cisco, and Huawei, have pushed for the 6GHz band to be delicensed, thereby opening it up for Wi-Fi in India.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tDepartment of Telecommunication (DoT) officials, however, indicate no decision has been taken on opening up 6 GHz airwaves as yet.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn December 2023, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) set aside 6.425-7.125GHz for licensed, mobile operations. The decision was taken at the 10th World Radiocommunication Conference held every 3-4 years to review and revise international agreements on the use of radio spectrum.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGlobally, the move by the United States to make the 6 GHz band available for unlicensed use has created a trend in many countries like Brazil and Saudi Arabia. On the other hand, China will use 1200 MHz in the 6 GHz band for 5G, while Europe has split the band, with the upper part considered for 5G and a new 500 MHz tranche available for Wi-Fi.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn 2023, Trai said the lower end of the 6 GHz spectrum band can be allocated for unlicensed use such as WiFi, while the upper end is licensed for IMT. It said this would be in line with global precedents. It noted that India has far less spectrum devoted to unlicensed use than other major economies.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\to9 Solutions is a US-based company that uses artificial intelligence (AI) for supply-chain planning and forecasting for international enterprises that include Marelli, Marks and Spencer, PepsiCo and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. The company is valued at more than $3.7 billion and in India it has offices in Bengaluru and Coimbatore where 1,980 employees and 23 interns work. <strong>CHAKRI GOTTEMUKKALA</strong>, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of o9 Solutions, met with <strong>Pranjal Sharma</strong> in Davos during the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting. Edited excerpts from an interview:</div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What challenges in supply chains is o9 is trying to address?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOne major issue is value leakage, which occurs when silo-ed functions, planning horizons and technologies prevent organisations from making synchronised decisions at the optimal speed required. This fragmentation leads to inefficiencies, reactive processes, and lost value. Another critical challenge is external volatility. Companies must navigate disruptions caused by geopolitical events, supply chain shocks, climate change, and more, requiring them to act quickly and with agility.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSupply-chain complexity continues to grow. Multi-tier supplier networks, higher product variability and evolving customer needs make it increasingly difficult to maintain end-to-end visibility and operational efficiency. Organisations are also under pressure to embed sustainability in their operations. Meeting ESG (environmental, social, governance) goals while maintaining efficiency requires integrating sustainability metrics directly into planning and decision-making. Lastly, outdated and fragmented IT systems remain a significant barrier. Without real-time data access and collaboration, businesses struggle to respond optimally.</div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>How does o9 work and support decision-making?</strong></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe o9 Digital Brain is an AI-powered platform that centralises and enhances planning and decision-making across an organisation. At its core is the Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG), which acts as a digital twin of the company’s value chain. EKG integrates data from ERP (enterprise resource planning) systems, IoT (internet of things) devices, spreadsheets and external market intelligence to create a unified data model. This allows for fast, bi-directional propagation of plans and decisions between commercial, demand, supply and finance functions, as well as an organisation’s external partners. It enables businesses to simulate scenarios, predict risks, reap opportunities and make informed decisions faster with greater accuracy.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEKG enhances planning and decision-making by modeling complex interdependencies and providing near real-time scenario planning to assess financial, operational and environmental impacts. By ensuring all decision-makers work from a single source of truth it eliminates inefficiencies caused by silo-ed data. Additionally, its flexibility allows businesses to adapt as market conditions evolve, ensuring plans and decisions remain dynamic and data-driven.</div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What kind of technologies support your solutions?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\to9’s platform is built on advanced technologies designed for scalability, flexibility, and seamless integration. It leverages AI and machine learning technologies to deliver predictive and prescriptive analytics, improving forecasting accuracy and enabling real-time demand-supply synchronization. Digital Brain is compatible with major Cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIntegration with existing ERP systems like SAP and Oracle is designed to be seamless. o9’s open architecture supports multiple integration methods, including APIs, Kafka streams, and low-code/no-code pipelines, ensuring businesses can connect their existing systems without requiring an IT overhaul. This modular approach allows companies to adopt o9’s capabilities at their own pace, minimizing disruption and implementation complexity while maximizing long-term flexibility.</div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Integrating supply- and demand-side decisions can be challenging within existing structures of enterprises. What is the advantage of such integration?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIntegrating supply- and demand-side decision-making creates a single, unified view of business operations, allowing companies to respond more effectively to shifting demand and supply constraints. This alignment reduces inefficiencies such as trapped inventory and costly expedited shipping while improving overall planning accuracy. When marketing, production, and logistics operate in sync, organisations can optimise service levels, enhance customer satisfaction, and increase profitability.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis integration also supports proactive planning by enabling companies to identify risks earlier and simulate response strategies before disruptions occur. Additionally, businesses can achieve their sustainability goals more effectively by optimising resources, minimising waste and reducing their carbon footprint. Synchronising supply and demand ensures that products are available where and when they’re needed, helping companies build resilience, drive growth and enhance customer loyalty.</div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>If decisions are made by the platform, what role would managers have?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEven as platforms like o9 automate planning and decision-making, managers remain central to strategic oversight. Their role shifts from manual tasks to guiding higher-level business strategies and policies, ensuring that platform-driven decisions align with company objectives. Managers shift their focus to exception management, addressing high-stakes or complex situations that require human judgment.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAdditionally, managers act as change agents, driving the adoption of new technologies and fostering collaboration across teams. By breaking down silos and ensuring alignment across departments, they help organisations maximise the platform’s impact. Managers also focus on continuous improvement, using insights from the platform to refine processes, optimize operations, and identify new growth opportunities. Ultimately, they transform data-driven insights into actionable business strategies, ensuring the organisation fully capitalises on its digital transformation.</div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What kind of growth are you targeting in five years?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\to9 aims to become the most value-creating enterprise planning platform, leading the digital transformation of integrated business planning and decision-making. The company’s vision is to help organisations solve their most complex supply-chain challenges through AI-driven, scalable solutions. Over the next five years, o9 plans to expand its global client base beyond the enterprises it currently serves, entering new industries. The company is focused on advancing generative AI and agentic AI, automation, and sustainability planning to further enhance its platform’s capabilities.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\to9 is also accelerating the adoption of touchless planning, ESG metrics, multi-tier supply chain visibility (SRM), and revenue growth management (RGM) to help companies navigate increasing complexity and volatility. By continuing to innovate and deliver measurable value, o9 is positioning itself as the go-to platform for enterprise planning and decision-making.</div></div>",

Some of the prominent pollsters include:  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t- Axis My India  </div>\n<div>\r\n\t- CVoter  </div>\n<div>\r\n\t- IPSOS  </div>\n<div>\r\n\t- Jan Ki Baat  </div>\n<div>\r\n\t- Today's Chanakya  </div>\n<h3>\r\n\tDelhi elections 2025: Key constituencies and candidates</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tSome constituencies in Delhi are drawing attention due to the participation of prominent leaders.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>New Delhi constituency:</strong> AAP patron Arvind Kejriwal, BJP’s Parvesh Verma, and Congress candidate Sandeep Dixit, son of former Chief Minister Sheila Dixit, will compete for this high-profile seat.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Patparganj seat:</strong> AAP’s new entrant Avadh Ojha is contesting against BJP’s Ravinder Singh Negi, while Anil Chaudhary represents Congress.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Rohini seat:</strong> In this key North-West Delhi constituency, AAP’s Pradeep Mittal is up against BJP’s sitting MLA Vijender Gupta.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Kalkaji seat:</strong> A three-way contest is expected between incumbent Delhi Chief Minister Atishi Kapoor (AAP), former BJP MP Ramesh Bidhuri, and Congress leader Alka Lamba.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Jangpura constituency:</strong> BJP’s Sardar Tarvinder Singh Marwah is set to challenge AAP’s Manish Sisodia, with Congress fielding Farhad Suri.  </div>\n<h3>\r\n\tDelhi elections 2025: A three-way battle  </h3>\n<div>\r\n\tThe 70-seat Delhi Assembly elections are crucial for AAP, which is aiming for a third consecutive term. Meanwhile, the BJP, riding high on recent victories in Haryana and Maharashtra, is looking to gain ground.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Congress, a part of the INDIA bloc along with AAP at the national level, is also vying to revive its influence in the capital, where it once dominated the political landscape.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWith 699 candidates in the fray across 70 constituencies, the elections will serve as a referendum on AAP’s governance, while also shaping the future of BJP and Congress in Delhi for the next five years. The results on February 8 will determine whether AAP retains power or if BJP and Congress manage to stage a comeback.  </div>\n<h3>\r\n\tDelhi Assembly elections 2020  </h3>\n<div>\r\n\tIn the 2020 Assembly elections, the AAP secured a decisive victory, winning 62 out of 70 seats. The BJP, its closest rival, won only eight seats, while the Congress failed to win any.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAAP’s dominance was even more pronounced in 2015 when it won 67 seats, leaving BJP with just three and Congress with none.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\tDelhi Elections 2025: Were exit polls right In 2020?</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tDuring the 2020 elections, exit polls overwhelmingly predicted an AAP victory, with most forecasts giving the party over 50 seats.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndia Today-Axis My India projected the highest range for AAP at 59-68 seats. Meanwhile, Jan Ki Baat, NewsX-Neta, and India News Nation estimated 55 seats for AAP.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTimes Now was one of the few polls to predict a slightly closer contest, giving AAP 47 seats and BJP 23.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tUltimately, the actual results closely aligned with the predictions, as AAP won 62 seats and BJP secured eight. Notably, exit polls in 2020 were more accurate compared to 2015, when predictions had significantly underestimated AAP’s landslide victory.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor live updates and thorough coverage of exit polls, please visit <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com\"><em>Business Standard</em></a>.</div></div>",
