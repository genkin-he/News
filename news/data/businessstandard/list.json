At present, the stock looks weak on the charts, but is seen trading in a fairly oversold zone. Hence, some pullback at the counter can be anticipated.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> As such, key support for the stock stands at Rs 4,900 levels, with near support likely around Rs 5,200 levels. On the upside, the stock needs to break and trade consistently above Rs 5,780 for a likely rally towards Rs 6,125 levels. Interim resistance for the stock exists at Rs 5,665 and Rs 6,000-mark. <a href=\"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/data/general-file-upload/2025-02/NUVAMA_040225.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART</strong></a><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small><br/></div>",
