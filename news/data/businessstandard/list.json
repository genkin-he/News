In the third quarter (Q3FY25) brokerages tracked by Business Standard expect ITC's adjusted net profit to decline 3.5 per cent in the quarter ended December 31, 2024, on average, to Rs 5,151.12 crore as compared to Rs 5,340 crore a year ago. PAT is likely to decline due to the low tax rate in the base quarter.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, on a sequential basis, the PAT is expected to rise 3.2 per cent.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn Q3, the revenue of ITC, on average, is pegged at Rs 18,395.42 crore as compared to Rs 19,484.5 crore a year ago which implies a slip of 5.5 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y). On a quarter-on-quarter (Q-o-Q) basis, the revenue is estimated to slip 3.9 per cent.
