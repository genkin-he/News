            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tAs artificial intelligence (AI) becomes a central driver of innovation, venture capital (VC) investors are stepping up to help portfolio companies navigate the complexities of AI adoption. From advising on strategic integrations to connecting with top-tier AI talent, VCs are offering more than just capital; they are providing the guidance and resources needed to harness AI’s full potential.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tExperts said the rapid rise of AI tools like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Qwen 2.5 has left many startups scrambling to keep up as the pace of disruption accelerates.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“AI is evolving at such an unprecedented pace—what was relevant yesterday may be outdated tomorrow. Given this rapid evolution, the best strategy is to focus on what will remain constant: the need for adaptability,” said Preeti Sampat, partner, Eximius Ventures, a leading VC firm that backs companies across fintech, software-as-a-service (SaaS), frontier tech, and consumer tech.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSampat said most Indian software companies operate in the application layer rather than the infrastructure layer, unlike China, which has made significant strides in foundational AI models like DeepSeek and Qwen. To stay ahead, she said Indian companies must design flexible architectures that can seamlessly integrate multiple AI models as technology advances.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“This is particularly critical now, as the cost of AI is decreasing, making intelligent software development more accessible,” said Sampat. “By maintaining adaptability and focusing on customer needs, application-layer companies can capitalise on these advancements.”</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhen asked how Eximius is supporting its portfolio companies in adopting an AI strategy, Sampat pointed out that it is about enhancing existing software solutions by layering AI capabilities on top to improve functionality. The other aspect is developing AI-native modules, which can be built in a modular fashion. These modules can vary in automation levels, ranging from fully automated to human-in-the-loop systems.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The key is to identify where AI can provide the most value and implement it strategically, ensuring that it enhances efficiency, automation, and user experience in a meaningful way,” said Sampat.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFor instance, one of Eximius’ portfolio companies, DecoverAI, is transforming the legal tech space by automating legal service providers (LSPs) in the litigation sector, a trillion-dollar market. DecoverAI focuses on litigation support, making legal workflows more efficient through AI-driven copilots and autonomous agents. Initially, they built copilots to assist lawyers in case preparation and real-time courtroom support. However, with the rise of AI agents, they are now incorporating autonomous workflows that can handle certain tasks independently.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“This balance between AI-assisted and AI-driven automation not only enhances efficiency but also reduces costs, making DecoverAI a standout player in legal AI,” said Sampat.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>AI adoption must be strategic</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnil Joshi, managing partner at Unicorn India Ventures, believes AI may not be applicable as it is to all businesses. However, he said Unicorn India actively evaluates the potential impact of AI on respective businesses and accordingly advises companies on their AI goals.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis includes firms using AI for internal operations to gain an edge over competitors. The other goal is making product offerings AI-compatible so that customers can benefit from cutting-edge solutions.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOne of Unicorn India’s portfolio firms, Genrobotic, recently worked on a robo-arm leveraging AI. It is helping eliminate risks to humans in difficult tasks while improving productivity.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tJoshi said having an AI strategy is crucial, as it involves engaging quality resources for building AI solutions, which is expensive. He also stressed the importance of continuously monitoring and evaluating AI’s impact. Otherwise, companies may end up spending excessive man-hours and resources on solutions that lack practical use cases.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Timely intervention will certainly help companies build the right solutions needed by customers,” said Joshi. “We strongly encourage companies to build in-house AI capabilities or intellectual property. It will certainly help in keeping pace with changes in the tech space.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>AI specialists: A necessity or an option?</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSonal Saldanha, vice president for investments at 3one4, said his firm insists that companies experiment with and embrace new AI tools with urgency—not just for marketing.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Because we’re seeing so many real-world examples of impact,” said Saldanha.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t3one4 counts fresh meat and seafood delivery startup Licious, shared electric vehicle mobility company Yulu, and Ayurvedic consumer products firm Kapiva among its portfolio companies.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAs far as building AI-enabled products is concerned, Saldanha said teams at various companies already have too much on their plates. Using closed-source foundational model APIs (application programming interfaces) is often the easiest way to get started. Moving to self-hosting open-source models, which provide more flexibility but require greater technical expertise, can be adopted later in the product’s life cycle.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“When it comes to consuming AI products internally, again, the best product wins. Building and maintaining a home-grown implementation of something is often not worth the effort at startups, where focus is especially important,” said Saldanha.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, Saldanha does not buy into the notion that companies need ‘AI specialists’ to succeed. He believes it is as simple as hiring smart engineers who are willing to tinker and learn practical tooling, at least in the beginning. Later, more specialists can be recruited to solve specific growth-related problems.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Helping startups integrate AI</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGowri Shankar Nagarajan, associate partner at Antler India, said his firm provides advisory support to enable portfolio companies to adopt AI.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We have a bunch of AI practitioners who are available to any founder to brainstorm how they should think about using AI and the right tech stack for AI,” said Shankar.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAntler is also actively working with major tech companies to give startups access to AI tools to experiment before setting up a full-fledged product roadmap.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tGenerative AI (GenAI) has the potential to add a cumulative $1.2–1.5 trillion to India’s gross domestic product (GDP) over the next seven years, according to a report by EY. The report, titled AIdea of India: Generative AI’s Potential to Accelerate India’s Digital Transformation, states that in 2029-30 alone, GenAI could contribute an additional $359–438 billion to India’s GDP.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",

He was previously in India in June 2023. The current visit is seen by many as a rush to counter the impact of DeepSeek's achievement. The Chinese firm has demonstrated that foundational models can be built at a fraction of the cost of what OpenAI has managed.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn January 4, OpenAI announced that it would develop AI products for South Korea with chat app operator Kakao.

But it's your responsibility to try anyway. I genuinely believe in both those aspects. I reckon it's quite a futile pursuit,\" Altman had said at an event.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFollowing backlash over his comments, Altman later clarified that his remarks had been taken out of context.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"This is really taken out of context! The question was about competing with us with $10 million, which I really do think is not going to work. But I still said try!

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tGold loan portfolio of banks rose by 71.3 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) till December of the current financial year (FY25) to Rs 1.72 trillion, compared to 17 per cent growth a year ago, on the back of rising prices of the yellow metal and slowdown in unsecured loan following increase in risk weights last year.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Over the last year, gold loan growth has sharply increased, with a 68 per cent rise from April 2024 to December 2024 (M9FY25), while gold prices increased by around 21 per cent during the time,” said Ajit Velonie, senior director, Crisil Ratings.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“There has also been a partial slowdown in unsecured loan growth due to stricter regulations. The growth in gold loans has coincided with this period. Personal loans grew by only 5-6 per cent, compared to 16.5 per cent in the previous year. The slower growth in unsecured loans has likely led borrowers to turn to gold loans as an alternative,” said Velonie.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn November 2023, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) increased risk weight for unsecured loans by 25 percentage points to 125 per cent.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe personal loans segment showed 9.7 per cent growth in December 2024, compared to 20.8 per cent in December 2023. Credit card loans also saw moderation in growth at 15.6 per cent in December 2024, down from 32.6 per cent a year ago.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBank credit growth in the retail loan segment, including housing, vehicle, credit cards, and personal loans, dropped to 14.9 per cent Y-o-Y in December 2024, down from 17.6 per cent in December 2023.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe gold loan prices increased by 20.4 per cent to Rs 75,857 per 10 gram in December 2024 from Rs 62,993 per 10 gram in the year-ago period.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Factors contributing to the rise in gold loans include rising prices of the yellow metal, as the value of loans taken against jewellery also increases amid rise in gold prices. People with gold jewellery are also borrowing more to refinance their loans as the value of gold increases,” said Kirti Timmanagoudar, head of strategy and co-lending, IIFL Finance.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The crackdown on unsecured lending and stress in the MFI space might also be contributing factors. It is likely a cumulative effect of these elements, rather than one factor being responsible,” said Timmanagoudar.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAccording RBI data, since May 2024, one bank has changed the classification of agricultural loan into “Loans against gold jewellery” under the retail segment.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Loans previously classified as agricultural are now being treated as gold loans. This reclassification might explain the slower growth in agricultural loans, which have only grown by 8 per cent compared to previous years,” Timmanagoudar added.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The slowdown in supply of unsecured lending might give an impetus but gold loan has been witnessing an upward trajectory due to its own features. Today it is a popular choice among customers, especially for short-term requirements, and acts as a vital financial inclusion tool,” said Shaji Varghese, chief executive officer (CEO), Muthoot FinCorp.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe December edition of the financial stability report (FSR) of the RBI observed the rapid increase in gold loan disbursals during the period ending September 2024 compared to the same time period last year.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo address the non-adherence to prudential guidelines by the supervised entities (SEs) in grant of loans against pledge of gold ornaments and jewellery, the RBI has advised SEs to comprehensively review their policies, identify gaps, and implement corrective measures within a specified timeframe.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tOla founder Bhavish Aggarwal today announced investment of Rs 2,000 crore in its artificial intelligence (AI) firm Krutrim. He also committed an investment of Rs 10,000 crore by next year.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWith this investment, the first AI unicorn in India has managed to have raise investments of close to $280 million. Along with the Rs 2,000 crore (around $230 million) and the $50 million the firm raised from Matrix Partners India in early 2024. According to sources, the Rs 2,000 crore have been raised via equity and debt. The company did not respond to the query of fund raise.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe only other player in the Indian AI ecosystem to raise funds is Sarvam AI, which raised $41 million in 2023, which was led by Lightspeed along with participation from Peak XV Partners and Khosla Venture. Hanooman, the other player which is also building SMLs, had plans to raise funds.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe founder of Ola Electric and Ola Mobility also announced KritrimAI lab. More importantly, he also announced that the company is releasing Krutrim’s work to the open source community and also published a few of its technical reports. The announcement to open source its model comes at the back of DeepSeek’s announcement to open source its own model.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn a X post, Aggarwal said: “We’ve been working on AI for a year, today we’re releasing our work to the open source community and also publishing a bunch of technical reports. Our focus is on developing AI for India - to make AI better on Indian languages, data scarcity, cultural context etc.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe further added that they have deployed India’s first GB200 deployment in partnership with NVIDIA, and will be live by March, “…and we will make it the largest supercomputer in India by end of year,” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIn a X post on January 31, Aggarwal also said that Kritrim is also using the DeepSeek model. “India can’t be left behind in AI. @Krutrim has accelerated efforts to develop world class AI. As a first step, our cloud now has DeepSeek models live, hosted on Indian servers. Pricing lowest in the world,” he had posted on X. He also added that thousands of developers have already used DeepSeek models hosted on Kritrim cloud.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tToday’s announcement of AI labs is crucial for Krutrim, as for the first time the company is sharing its models with the open source community. So far the company has not shared details about its models.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSome of the models that Krutirm has released to the Open Source community include Krutrim 2 and Krutrim 1 LLMs. “While Krutrim 1 (India’s first LLM) was launched on Jan 24, it was a basic 7B model. We’re launching Krutrim 2 today as a much improved model,” said Aggarwal. The company claims that Krutrim 2 is a best-in-class LLM for Indic.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Krutrim-2 is a 12 billion parameters dense transformer model, built on the Mistral-NeMo architecture. Our team ensured that Krutrim-2 received comprehensive training on a rich dataset encompassing English, Indic languages (hundreds of billions of tokens), code snippets, mathematical concepts, literary works, and high quality synthetically generated content. It is natively multilingual (English and 22 Indian languages) and supports a context window of 128K tokens,” said the firm's blog.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe company also released Chitrarth 1, vision language model built on top of Krutrim 1 capable of understanding images and documents.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThey also released the speech language model, Dhwani 1built on top of Krutrim 1 capable of tasks like Speech translations.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tKrutrim also announced Vyakhyarth 1, an art Indic Embedding model for use cases like Search and RAG.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAggarwal also added that in addition to these releases they have also developed benchmarks for Indian LLM performance. “Since there was no global benchmark for Indic performance, we’ve developed “BharatBench”…” he added. It is a special evaluation tool designed to test how well AI models understand and perform in Indian languages and cultural contexts.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhether these benchmarks’ will be accepted by other builders of AI models in India is debatable. “Existing benchmarks in English and Chinese, such as MMLU, ARC, TruthfulQA and others, do not adequately capture the unique linguistic and cultural nuances of India. There is a specific need for a benchmark that addresses the diversity of India,” explained Krutrim on the need for benchmarking Indic languages.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\r\n\tThe<strong><a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/topic/telecom-regulatory-authority-of-india-trai\" target=\"_blank\"> Telecom Regulatory Authority of India </a></strong>(Trai) has recommended the auction of several 5G high-band or millimetre wave (mmWave) spectrum in upcoming spectrum auctions. On Tuesday, TRAI said spectrum in the 37-37.5 GHz and 37.5-40 GHz frequency ranges should be auctioned, while it has recommended against auctions for the 42.5-43.5 GHz frequency range.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe move is expected to find support from telecom service providers who have pushed for access to it. MmWave or spectrum bands above 24 gigahertz (GHz) are a valuable resource when targeting densely populated urban areas. The high band offers an opportunity for service providers to offer unprecedented peak rates, low latency, and high capacity.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTRAI has said telcos will have the option to pay for the spectrum upfront or in 20 equal annual instalments. While mmWave is limited due to signals not being able to travel as far as mid- and low-band signals—often travelling less than a mile and being more susceptible to interference from trees, buildings, and even glass—it offers significant benefits. If the signal remains unencumbered, users can achieve connection speeds between 1 Gbps and 3 Gbps or even higher.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe regulator has recommended that, in addition to access service providers, internet service providers and machine-to-machine service providers should also be permitted to participate in the auction.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTRAI had issued a consultation paper on the issue back in April last year. Subsequently, 12 stakeholders submitted comments, and four stakeholders furnished counter-comments. On Tuesday, it also released its recommendations on block sizes for the spectrum bands and the reserve prices for MHz in the 37-40 GHz band. The prices range from a high of Rs 76 lakh in the metro circle of Delhi to Rs 3 lakh in Jammu &amp; Kashmir and the North East.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, TRAI has pointed out that some bands cannot be opened up. \"Owing to the non-availability of the device ecosystem in the 42.5-43.5 GHz frequency range, it will be prudent that the frequency range 42.5-43.5 GHz is not put to auction in the forthcoming spectrum auction. DoT may send a separate reference for seeking the Authority’s recommendations for the 42.5-43.5 GHz frequency range for IMT at an appropriate time,\" TRAI said. Telcos had earlier pushed for opening up spectrum in this band.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile the 37-37.5 GHz band has been globally earmarked for broadband mobile use, the 37.5-40 GHz and 40-42.5 GHz bands have both mobile use and satellite gateway link uses. Similarly, while the 40-42.5 GHz band is only for satellite usage, the 42.5-43.5 GHz band has both usage types. While telcos have called for flexible use between terrestrial and satellite-based networks, arguing that there would be no interference, TRAI has not clarified its stance on the matter.</div></div>",
