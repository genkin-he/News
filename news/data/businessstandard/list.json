In the first nine months of FY25, the company achieved revenue of Rs 698 crore, nearly equalling the revenue from operations of the entire previous financial year. This performance was driven by a strong ramp-up in contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) business and consistent growth in advanced pharmaceutical intermediates, the company said.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe company’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was up 159 per cent YoY at Rs 68.7 crore; margins expanded to 25.0 per cent from 15.9 per cent in Q3FY24.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe management said the company’s pipeline of CDMO projects is progressing well, with several initiatives nearing commercialization by FY26, solidifying the foundation for sustained long-term growth.

That’s exactly what OmniHuman-1, the latest breakthrough from ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, aims to achieve. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis AI framework is designed to generate lifelike human motion and speech from minimal input—just an image and an audio sample—solving a key challenge in AI-driven video creation. Previous models struggled with scaling movement data efficiently, often losing valuable motion patterns in the process. OmniHuman-1 advances the field by integrating multiple input sources simultaneously, including images, audio, body poses, and textual descriptions, ensuring more precise and fluid motion synthesis.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h2>\r\n\tTrained on 19,000 hrs video footage </h2>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo build this system, ByteDance researchers trained it on 19,000 hours of video footage, allowing it to smoothly animate still frames into dynamic sequences that feel incredibly real. The AI first compresses movement data from its various inputs and then refines it by comparing its generated videos to real footage. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThis two-step process enables OmniHuman-1 to produce highly accurate mouth movements, facial expressions, and body gestures, making the final output look natural and immersive.

His suggestions included monitoring PM2.5 levels, wearing an N95 mask, and using air recirculation mode in vehicles while travelling through polluted areas.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tJohnson’s concerns about India’s air quality were previously highlighted during his visit in December last year when he abruptly left Nikhil Kamath’s ‘WTF’ podcast, despite the presence of air purifiers in the room and his use of an N95 mask. The interview was recorded in a luxury hotel in Mumbai’s Bandra area, where the AQI at the time was around 120.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile praising Kamath as a “gracious host”, Johnson said that the room was circulating outdoor air, rendering the purifier ineffective.

No one wore a mask, which could significantly reduce exposure. It was baffling,” he wrote on X.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile, Nikhil’s brother and Zerodha co-founder Nithin Kamath, who was also on the podcast with Johnson, has ignited a debate by suggesting that real estate prices should be tied to air quality. “So, shouldn’t property prices be linked to AQI? The higher the AQI, the lower the real estate prices should be. That means if an area has poor air quality, property prices and rents should be lower, and vice versa. After all, by living in such areas, you are accepting higher odds of respiratory ailments, cancer, etc,” Kamath wrote on LinkedIn.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",
