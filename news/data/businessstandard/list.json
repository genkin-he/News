            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\n<strong>By Ilena Peng</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tPresident Donald Trump’s tariff plans threaten to raise US home construction costs, making it even more difficult for Americans already facing a tight housing market.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrump’s proposed 25 per cent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, which have been delayed until at least March, along with a 10 per cent levy now in effect on products from China, could make building a typical home as much as $29,000 pricier, said David Belman, a second-generation homebuilder in Wisconsin.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tA large portion of that increase — as much as $14,000 — would come from the tariff on Canada, said Belman, whose supplier receives 80 per cent of its lumber from the country. Canada, which is the US’s biggest foreign lumber supplier, has already been dealing with higher duties on its shipments that started last summer.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile, tariffs on Mexico may raise costs for other materials like gypsum used in drywall, and China supplies fixtures like appliances and countertops, Belman said. </div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The hard part is it hurts the beginning buyer, the first-time homebuyer,” Belman said. “That’s going to reduce housing affordability, and that’s obviously something we as builders are all concerned with.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHousing inflation has remained stubbornly high month after month amid a national shortage, becoming a major issue for voters in the recent election. Higher interest rates have further pressured construction. While increases in housing prices have recently showed signs of cooling, some of Trump’s proposals including tariffs could further threaten affordability.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe inflationary risk is at odds with an executive order Trump issued on his first day in office to lower housing prices, according to the National Association of Home Builders. More than 70 per cent of US softwood lumber and gypsum imports come from Canada and Mexico, respectively, the Washington-based group said. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Tariffs on lumber and other building materials increase the cost of construction and discourage new development, and consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,” NAHB Chairman Carl Harris said in a statement. The trade association has sought an exemption for building materials.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTo be sure, lumber is one of many construction inputs. Zoltan van Heyningen, the executive director of the US Lumber Coalition, said in a Monday press release that the cost of lumber makes up about 1.3 per cent of the total cost of an average new home, and “doesn’t move the needle” on overall prices.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe idea that existing “duties or President Trump’s tariffs on unfairly traded Canadian lumber imports would cause lumber prices to dramatically increase home prices is nonsensical,” van Heyningen said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrump, who has used tariff threats as a negotiation tool, on Monday agreed to delay levies against Mexico and Canada for one month. Companies across borders, though, are already reacting.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tSome Canadian lumber mills have told customers that they will raise prices by 25 per cent if tariffs are put in place, according to Russ Taylor, a forestry consultant based in British Columbia. That has US companies holding back on purchasing, hoping for short-lived tariffs or other distribution channels, said Crystal Gauvin, a senior economist at Forest Economic Advisors.</div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tCurrent lumber inventories may only last one to two months, even with demand still weak and the US not yet in its peak building season, said Dustin Jalbert, senior economist at commodity pricing agency Fastmarkets.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“It’s not going to take long for prices to have to start moving higher here to keep the supply chain stocked,” Jalbert said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tLumber futures in Chicago slumped 4.6 per cent Tuesday on news of tariff delays, erasing gains from the previous two sessions. Shares in Canadian lumber producers have slid since November as potential tariffs add further pressure on an industry already struggling amid higher US duties. West Fraser Timber Co. ended lower in Toronto on Tuesday, while Canfor Corp. and Interfor Corp. rose.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tTrump said at the World Economic Forum last month that the US doesn’t “need their lumber because we have our own forests.” </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThose are largely concentrated in the US South, which has already been expanding production in recent years, and in the Pacific Northwest, said Rajan Parajuli, an associate professor of forest economics and policy at North Carolina State University. But timber harvesting is costly, and the current US supply chain is limited. Shipments from Europe, meanwhile, are too small to offset a loss in Canadian supplies, he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“I don’t think overnight or even in a month, even a year, we can replace Canadian lumber coming to the US,” Parajuli said. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

Within seconds, Beijing announced additional tariffs on roughly 80 products to take effect on Feb. 10, launched an antitrust investigation into Google, tightened export controls on critical minerals, and added two US companies to its blacklist of unreliable entities.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe swift but calculated retaliation signaled that Beijing had learned a lesson from its first trade fight with Trump, when China retaliated with tariffs on par or close to what the US imposed. This time Xi only put tariffs on $14 billion worth of American products, a sliver of what Trump targeted, while taking other measures that showed off China’s ability to inflict further pain on US companies if needed.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div style=\"float:left\">\n<span class=\"fixed-height-container\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box;display:block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0\"><img alt=\"charts\" class=\"zoomimg\" data-nimg=\"fill\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;background-size:cover;background-position:0% 0%;filter:blur(20px);background-image:url(\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNk0AAAAC4AKhMfIC0AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\")'/><noscript><img alt=\"charts\" class=\"zoomimg\" data-nimg=\"fill\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2025-02/05/full/1738723607-2606.png?im=Resize=(640,480)\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%\"/></noscript></span></span></div></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe shift reflects both Xi’s success at diversifying imports away from the US since Trump’s first term, as well as China’s more precarious economic situation. The Chinese leader has been relying on manufacturing and overseas sales to keep growth ticking along as he moves to burst a property bubble, all while dealing with increased deflationary pressure.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tChina is being restrained because it “has more to lose,” due to its huge trade imbalance with the US, according to Larry Hu, head of China economics at Macquarie Group Ltd. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“A full-blown tariff war is not in China’s interest,” he added. “Instead, China is likely to respond to tariffs mainly through domestic stimulus.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe Chinese leader’s cautious reply avoided roiling markets, which have been whipsawed in the past week by Trump’s tariff twists and turns. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong rebounded to gain 3.5 per cent on Tuesday, while the offshore yuan was little changed after paring earlier losses.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<h3>\r\n\t\tChina’s Retaliation:</h3>\n<div></div><div><blockquote class=\"blockquoteBG styleQ1\" style=\"background-color:#FFF5EB;padding:8px;overflow:hidden\">\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tENTITY LIST: Calvin Klein owner PVH Corp. and US gene sequencing company Illumina Inc.</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tEXPORT CONTROLS: Tungsten and other critical metals used in electronic, aviation and defense industries</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t10 per cent TARIFFS: Goods including tractors and functional vehicles</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t15 per cent TARIFFS: Goods including coal and liquefied natural gas</li>\n<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tANTITRUST PROBE: Google</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote></div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe question now is whether leaders of the world’s biggest economies can quickly reach an agreement. Trump said on Monday he will seek a deal with China, and said talks would take place shortly. He tamped that down on Tuesday after the tariffs came into effect, saying there’s no rush to speak with Xi and a call would take place at the appropriate time.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tTalks between the two leaders would offer a first glimpse of Trump’s priorities this time around. The US president has alternated tough talk on China with more dovish statements, laying out the potential contours of an agreement.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tTrump wants more balanced trade and ordered an agreement he signed in 2020, known as the Phase One deal, to be reevaluated, suggesting tariff talks with China could yet drag out for months. But he’s also seeking Xi’s help in swiftly stopping Russia’s war in Ukraine, and is pushing for China to split ownership of video app TikTok with a US company within a ticking 75-day deadline. <small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tIn a sign that a deal is front of mind, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform hours before the US tariffs took effect that there was “great interest” in TikTok, adding a deal would “be wonderful for China.”</div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tTrump has previously said that Microsoft Corp. is in talks to acquire the US arm of ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, while Chinese officials favor a sale to the president’s billionaire adviser Elon Musk, Bloomberg News has previously reported. A deal would rescue the China-owned app from a US ban, but could put its prized algorithm in foreign hands.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t\tChinese officials enter talks with less bargaining room. The Asian manufacturing powerhouse exports over three times more goods to the US than it buys, according to data from China’s Customs General Administration, meaning it has fewer goods to tariff.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t\tSome of Beijing’s warning shots were purely symbolic, underscoring that more limited room for maneuvering. China honed its regulatory sights on Google, even though Alphabet Inc.’s search services have been unavailable in the country since 2010. There are other companies such as Musk’s electric vehicle giant Tesla Inc. and smartphone giant Apple Inc., however, that still have massive business interests in the world’s No. 2 economy.</div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t\tChinese regulators are also considering launching a probe into Intel Corp., the Financial Times reported Tuesday, citing two people familiar with the matter. Intel didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t\tThe shape of any future deal will hinge on what concessions China might agree to make, said Helen Qiao, chief economist for greater China for Bank of America Global Research. <small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tChina’s options range from promises to buy more American oil and gas and keeping the yuan stable to delivering on the Phase One deal, she said. “It’s probably going to be a combination of those measures that would probably help repair the relationship.” </div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tChina’s influence over the Panama Canal — where a Hong Kong company has two of the five ports adjacent to the waterway — is a wild card that Trump could press Xi on, according to Chang Shu, chief Asia economist for Bloomberg Economics. His administration has already threatened to take back the canal if Panama doesn’t reduce China’s sway.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t“China could twist the arm of CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. to reduce its operations there,” she said, noting that was a “remote” possibility.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFor now, Beijing is striking a balancing act between looking strong while not upping the ante, according to Josef Gregory Mahoney, a professor of international relations at Shanghai’s East China Normal University. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t“We might be seeing two giants sizing each up and testing each other’s resolve while also playing to their domestic audiences before shaking hands,” he added. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

A threat assessment by the country’s intelligence agencies found the technology posed an unacceptable risk, he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tFounded in Hangzhou only 20 months ago, DeepSeek’s technology made waves in January with a new mobile app featuring its reasoning AI chatbot — which articulates its approximation of thought process and research before delivering a response — that seemed to suggest top-tier AI could be developed without huge investments in hardware. Its appeal took it to the top of worldwide download charts. However, doubts quickly arose about the security of the service.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“AI is a technology full of potential and opportunity but the government will not hesitate to act when our agencies identify a national security risk,” Burke said in the statement. Forestalling any criticisms about Australia acting against the app simply because of its Chinese origin, he added that the government’s approach was “country-agnostic and focused on the risk to the Australian government and our assets.”</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe action does not extend to the personal devices of private citizens. However, Australians could “read something into the fact that the government has decided that it’s not secure to have on government phones,” Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations Murray Watt told Channel 7 on Wednesday.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“People might want to have a think about that when it comes to their personal phones,” he said. “We’d certainly be encouraging people to really get across the online privacy guidelines and rules that DeepSeek has and make a really good decision about whether they want to take that risk themselves.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAustralia is not the first country to take action against DeepSeek. Italy’s privacy regulator has ordered for it to be blocked to protect consumers’ data, while Ireland’s Data Protection Commission has asked for more information from the company. Hundreds of private companies have also taken the precautionary measure of blocking access to DeepSeek, Bloomberg News reported last week.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Australian government was a leader in deciding to ban Chinese networking giant Huawei Technologies Co. from its 5G systems in 2018, which sparked a diplomatic feud between Canberra and Beijing. The spat eventually culminated in China imposing trade sanctions on Australian exports at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Relations between the two countries have improved since the election of the center-left Anthony Albanese government in May 2022.</div></div>",
