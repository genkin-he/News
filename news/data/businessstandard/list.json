Currently, over 450 million users utilise digital payment methods such as UPI for retail payments.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“The legal system also must be evolved to ensure that these activities are penalised at the appropriate level. We see that 95 per cent frauds are consumer initiated frauds, investment-related frauds. It is important to make citizens aware about these at a large scale,” Asbe said. His comments come at a time when digital payments frauds have continued to drain the wallets of users.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIndians have lost Rs 485 crore to UPI-related frauds in 632,000 reported incidents until September in the ongoing financial year (FY25), according to data from the Ministry of Finance. Since 2022-23, UPI-related frauds have accounted for a cumulative loss of Rs 2,145 crore across 2.7 million reported incidents. In 2023-24 (FY24) alone, 1.34 million fraud cases were reported, amounting to losses of Rs 1,087 crore.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe rise in UPI-related frauds coincides with the growth in the number of users and the total transactions processed on the real-time payments system. In 2024 alone, the NPCI recorded over 172 billion transactions on the real-time payments system.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We have the potential to process 100-150 billion transactions (every month). How do we grow now? If you want to bring in the 300-400 million people who are not digitally savvy onto the digital platform, there has to be some incentivisation,” Asbe said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCurrently, there is no merchant discount rate (MDR) on UPI payments. MDR refers to a fee that merchants pay to payment processing companies for processing a transaction. Debit transactions made on UPI continue to remain free and banks along with fintechs bear the costs of processing these payments. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Union Budget 2025 too was muted on digital payment subsidies that trickle down to banks and financial technology (fintech) firms. The government slashed the financial year 2026 (FY26) outlay for promoting peer-to-merchant (P2M) UPI transactions and RuPay debit card payments.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Centre allocated just Rs 437 crore in the Budget for the promotion of these types of transactions. This was a 78 per cent cut from the final outlay of Rs 2,000 crore allocated for FY25.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAsbe elucidated that investments in technology and consumer education awareness were a continuous process. “The use of tech can identify the early trends in terms of future potential risk. How do you continuously remain vigilant and make over and above investments which are required to ensure that the trust in the payment system is protected?” he asked. </div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\n<div>\r\n\t\tSwiggy on Wednesday reported widening of its consolidated net loss to Rs 799 crore for the third quarter of the financial year 2024-25 (Q3FY25) from Rs 574.4 crore a year-ago period, a slippage which the food and grocery delivery platform attributed to a rise in capex on warehousing and dark store infrastructure.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIt was Swiggy’s first quarterly results post its stock market debut last month.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe company’s consolidated revenue from operations grew 31 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) to Rs 3,993 crore, up from Rs 3,049 crore in Q3FY24. Swiggy’s consolidated total income also went up 30.8 per cent to Rs 4,095.8 crore in Q3FY25, compared to Rs 3,130.9 crore reported in Q3FY24.</div></div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe firm told the regulator that it expects to achieve “positive adjusted Ebitda by the third quarter of FY26.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tWhen asked about the reasons for widening of the net loss, Swiggy chief financial officer (CFO) Rahul Bothra, attributed it to adjusted Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation), which is a combination of food delivery and investments in quick commerce. ESOP charges also played a role.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“Adjusted Ebitda has gone up by Rs 149 crore in the quarter. There is a depreciation increase as a result of the capex that we have spent on both warehousing as well as dark store infrastructure,” said Bothra.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tRegarding Swiggy’s path to profitability and strategies related to that, Bothra said that in the previous quarter, Swiggy had guided for adjusted Ebitda of break even at the corporate level by October-December quarter in 2025. He said the company is committed to that guidance and this would be driven as a result of the food delivery Ebitda margin, where the firm is witnessing a strong growth.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“As a result of food delivery, increasing its cash flow profile and quick commerce getting contribution break-even in the quarter that I mentioned, we believe that we can achieve adjusted profitability,” said Bothra.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tSwiggy’s gross order value (GOV) grew 38 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 12,165 crore. The company said the consolidated adjusted (Ebitda) loss reduced by 2 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 490 crore but rose Rs 149 crore quarter-on-quarter (Q-o-Q).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe platform’s Average MTU (monthly transacting users) increased 25.3 per cent Y-o-Y to reach 17.8 million, with nearly a third of all users utilising more than one service on the platform.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“We delivered higher Y-o-Y growth across all three of our primary businesses during Q3, which accelerated B2C GOV growth to 38 per cent Y-o-Y,” said Sriharsha Majety, MD and Group CEO, Swiggy.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“The secular expansion in food delivery margins and cash flow generation is balanced by growth investments being made in quick-commerce including dark-stores expansion and marketing, amidst high competitive intensity in the near term. With this thrust, Instamart added another 86 stores in January 2025, and has grown MTUs to 9 million (+2 million),” he said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe company continued the focus on creating segmented offerings for the consumer during the festive quarter, which the company believes will open up more consumption occasions.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tIn terms of innovations and technology investments, Rohit Kapoor, CEO Food Marketplace, Swiggy said in recent months, the company introduced Bolt and Snacc (10-minute food delivery), and expanded into new categories within Quick-Commerce.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t“Bolt has been scaled up to 425 cities, already accounts for 9 per cent of overall food deliveries,” said Kapoor, adding, “While we are innovating, we’re also learning how to innovate without investing additional dollars into the food business.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tThe company also launched Swiggy Scenes focused on restaurant event reservations, and introduced One BLCK, the premium tier of Swiggy One subscription program.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tSwiggy’s food delivery business’ gross order value (GOV) grew 19.2 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 7,436 crore. Adjusted Ebitda grew 63.7 per cent Q-o-Q to Rs 184 crore, delivering a 2.5 per cent margin, up from 0.3 per cent a year ago. The segment also added 2.4 million MTUs over the past year, driven by multiple industry-leading innovations.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tSwiggy Instamart reported an 88 per cent Y-o-Y (15.5 per cent Q-o-Q) rise in GOV to Rs 3,907 crore. Average order value increased by 14 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 534 driven by greater selection and increased consumer salience.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\tInstamart added 96 new active stores during the quarter (+16 per cent Q-o-Q); driving up active darkstore area to 2.45 million sq ft (+25 per cent Q-o-Q). Growth investments in quick-commerce led to a reduction in contribution margin from -1.9 per cent in Q2FY25 to -4.6 per cent in Q3FY25, as the company ramped up user activation and dark-store expansion across geographies. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

But I wonder if we are all going to like this.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tOn that occasion in the first leg, referee Stuart Attwell used the public address system to announce via a wireless microphone that the goal scored by Tottenham striker Dominic Solanke in the 76th minute had been ruled out for offside. Attwell spoke after a VAR review lasting around two minutes.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTottenham manager Ange Postecoglou wasn't impressed with the historic moment at the time, saying: If people think that announcement tonight added anything to the game, I'm sorry. I mean, really, just get on with it.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tSlot was more concerned that the officials chose to make an announcement about what he described as an obvious decision rather than on a more contentious call, when Tottenham midfielder Lucas Bergvall avoided getting a second yellow card for a foul on Kostas Tsimikas.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhile Tsimikas was off the field, waiting to come back on having received treatment, Bergvall scored the only goal of the game.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI think the one we were more interested in was why he didn't give the second yellow card and that is something he didn't have to explain, Slot said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSemi-automated offside technology might come into the Premier League even earlier before the end of this season.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tInitially, the technology was supposed to be brought in after one of the international breaks in the first half of this season but was delayed because of issues in the testing process. Scholes said progress had been made in recent weeks.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe believe it to be the most accurate and the most future-proof system as well, Scholes said. I have to confess, given the difficulties that we had over the first few months of the season, I had severe doubts about this, but the progress made over the last four to six weeks has been significant.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tScholes said introducing the technology with potentially only a handful of games to go would not create an integrity issue.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLeague officials have said they hope it will reduce the time it takes to check for offside by an average of 31 seconds.</p><p></p></div>",
