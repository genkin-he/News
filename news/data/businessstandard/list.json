It offers incentives such as subsidies and tax incentives to manufacturers, aiming to make Madhya Pradesh a hub for drone production and services.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt provides for a 40 per cent capital investment subsidy with a cap of Rs 30 crore for new investments. Also, a 25 per cent subsidy on lease rent, with a maximum of Rs 5 lakh per year, is provided for three years.
