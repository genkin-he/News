The net result for the Nifty remains tepid. The NSE data shows that the Nifty February futures has gained 0.1 per cent in this period, while the open interest (OI) has declined by 1 per cent.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> Interestingly, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been net sellers in the last three trading sessions in index futures in the derivatives segment; with net sales of 11,108 contracts.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> As per the NSE derivatives data, FIIs long-short ratio in index futures is at the lowest point at 0.12 in more than a year.

Mehta Investment Interrmediates.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> The 21-DSMA is placed near 23,270 levels, which will act as immediate support for index followed by 23,000 levels, while 23,640 will serve as short-term resistance for index. As long as the index holds 23,000, traders are advised to follow a buy-on-dips strategy, the analyst said in a note.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> <strong>Stocks with long-short bets</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small> According to the NSE derivatives data, United Breweries (UBL), HFCL and ITC are the three stocks with significant long build-up.

The country is a particularly big source of avocados, supplying more than 90 per cent of what Americans eat. Canada, meanwhile, ships apples, mushrooms and potatoes.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Corn and pork</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tMexico ranks as the biggest buyer of US corn and pork and any counter measures could hurt America’s biggest crop as well as meat companies such as Tyson Foods Inc. and Smithfield Foods Inc.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We’ve been preparing for this,” Tyson’s Chief Executive Officer Donnie King said during a conference call on Monday. “We’ll leverage our global expertise to identify the best markets for our products.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tStill, Mexico may find it hard to replace American corn.

With zero tax liability for those earning below Rs 12 lakh and substantial tax savings of up to Rs 1.1 lakh for high earners, the proposed changes encourage individuals to opt for the simplified structure. If you fall within the affected income range, consider assessing your tax planning strategy to maximise savings under the new structure,\" said Value Research in a note.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Other key changes:</strong></div>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tLimit of Total Income for Rebate u/s 87A has been increased from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- under new regime and in consequently the Limit of Rebate enhanced from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs.60,000/- (except for income taxed at special rates).</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tUnder the new tax regime, Section 87A tax rebate will not available on any special rate income (such as S. 111A, 112 etc). Whereas, for the old tax regime, Section 87A tax rebate is still available on special rate income like STCG covered in Section 111A,LTCG covered in Section 112. Section 87A Rebate was never available on long term capital gain on equity (covered in Section 112A) under both regimes and no changes are made in the budget for the same.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tLimit of TDS on interest for senior citizens increased from Rs. 50,000/- to Rs. 1,00,000/- which will provide greater financial relief to retirees. Further, Limit on Rent enhanced from Rs. 2,40,000/- to Rs.6,00,000/- benefitting small tax payers earning rental income.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tTime limit to file updated return increased from 2 to 4 Years which will allow taxpayers correcting errors or omissions or allows to file ITR if they have not filed ITR.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tPeriod of Registration of smaller trusts has been increased from 5 to 10 Years on the condition that Total income without giving tax benefit does not exceed Rs. 5 Crore during preceding 2 years.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t As per NPS Vatsalaya scheme Started from 18th September 2024, parents/guardian can open account for minor child future benefit. It is now proposed to provide deduction u/s 80CCD(1B) of Rs.50,000 for contribution made to NPS Vatsalya Account which will be similar to deduction available as per current provisions for employer contribution to NPS available under new old regime.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tProvision of higher TDS rate will be applicable only in case PAN is not available and accordingly, provision of higher TDS on payment to non-filers (of return of income)</div>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tis removed.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tThe TCS threshold on remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) has been raised from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 10 lakh and no TCS will be applicable on goods but TDS on sale goods will continue to apply.

Tariffs along with any retaliatory measures will curb overseas sales and increase energy and fertiliser costs for farmers. All of that will likely mean higher prices for consumers at grocery stores. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrump has set general levies of 25 per cent on Canada and Mexico, though agreements were reached on Monday to delay those by a month, while a tariff of 10 per cent is set for Chinese goods. Whether or not the tariffs end up being implemented, and exactly how the other countries might retaliate, will be key to what happens to commodity prices.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“These tariffs will only make it harder for American families to put food on the table and for American farmers and ranchers to sell their products,” said Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat and member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. “Farmers and ranchers want an even playing field, not handouts necessitated by another Trump trade war.”<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-tariff-reversal-feeds-reputation-as-paper-tiger-on-trade-125020400119_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Donald Trump's tariff reversal feeds reputation as paper tiger on trade</a></strong></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe break down the markets that are vulnerable to disruption. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Fruit and vegetables</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tMexico and Canada accounted for nearly 90 per cent of US fresh vegetable imports by value in 2023, and more than half of fresh fruit shipments, according to the US Department of Agriculture.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMexico is now the biggest source of US farm imports, shipping tomatoes, fresh berries and other vegetables. The country is a particularly big source of avocados, supplying more than 90 per cent of what Americans eat. Canada, meanwhile, ships apples, mushrooms and potatoes.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Corn and pork</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tMexico ranks as the biggest buyer of US corn and pork and any counter measures could hurt America’s biggest crop as well as meat companies such as Tyson Foods Inc. and Smithfield Foods Inc.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We’ve been preparing for this,” Tyson’s Chief Executive Officer Donnie King said during a conference call on Monday. “We’ll leverage our global expertise to identify the best markets for our products.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tStill, Mexico may find it hard to replace American corn. The Latin American nation imported almost 19 million metric tonnes last year. Both Mexico and Canada are also key importers of US dairy products.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Soybeans and Canola oil</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tSoybeans were the poster child for the last trade war with China, with the world’s biggest buyer shrinking US purchases by 79 per cent in the first two years of the first Trump administration. A repeat of those actions could hurt farmers.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTariffs also mean American biofuels, food and consumer-product makers may need to pay more for oilseed crop products used in everything from shampoo and salad dressing to renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. The US accounted for more than 90 per cent of Canada’s canola oil exports in 2023, according to the USDA.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Fertilisers</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe US is highly dependent on potash from Canada, importing roughly 85 per cent of what it needs. The Fertilizer Institute and US Senator Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, have already urged Trump to exempt Canadian product from tariffs.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAn exemption is especially important ahead of spring planting of grains that are relied on for global food supply chains, Fertilizer Institute Chief Executive Officer Corey Rosenbusch said in a statement.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Tariff costs are passed on to the end-user,” said Alexis Maxwell, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. US farmers will likely pay $60 to $80 more per short ton for potash and ammonia fertilizers this year, she added.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Lumber</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMore than 70 per cent of US imports of softwood lumber and gypsum, used in drywall, come from Canada and Mexico respectively, and “consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,” Carl Harris, chairman of the Washington-based National Association of Homebuilders, said in a statement.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCanada is the biggest foreign supplier of lumber to its southern neighbor, accounting for as much as 30 per cent of supplies. The new US tariffs will likely be in addition to existing duties, which were hiked to 14.5 per cent last summer, according to Dustin Jalbert, senior economist at commodity pricing agency Fastmarkets.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",
