More than half the voters surveyed by AP VoteCast said support for transgender rights in government and society has gone too far.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe leaned into the rhetoric before the election, pledging to get rid of the transgender insanity, though his campaign offered little in the way of details.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tWednesday's order which coincides with National Girls and Women in Sports Day will involve how his administration will interpret Title IX, the law best known for its role in pursuing gender equity in athletics and preventing sexual harassment on campuses.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThis executive order restores fairness, upholds Title IX's original intent, and defends the rights of female athletes who have worked their whole lives to compete at the highest levels, said US Rep. Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEvery administration has the authority to issue its own interpretations of the landmark legislation. The last two presidential administrations including Trump's first offer a glimpse at the push-pull involved.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBetsy DeVos, the education secretary during Trump's first term, issued a Title IX policy in 2020 that narrowed the definition of sexual harassment and required colleges to investigate claims only if they're reported to certain officials.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Biden administration rolled back that policy last April with one of its own that stipulated the rights of LGBTQ+ students would be protected by federal law and provided new safeguards for victims of campus sexual assault. The policy stopped short of explicitly addressing transgender athletes. Still, more than a half-dozen Republican-led states immediately challenged the new rule in court.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAll Trump has to say is, We are going to read the regulation traditionally,' said Doriane Lambelet Coleman, a professor at Duke Law School.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHow this order could affect the transgender athlete population a number that is incredibly difficult to pin down is uncertain.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Associated Press reported in 2021 that in many cases, the states introducing a ban on transgender athletes could not cite instances where their participation was an issue. When Utah state legislators overrode a veto by Gov. Spencer Cox in 2022, the state had only one transgender girl playing in K-12 sports who would be affected by the ban. It did not regulate participation for transgender boys.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis is a solution looking for a problem, Cheryl Cooky, a professor at Purdue University who studies the intersection of gender, sports, media and culture, told the AP after Trump was elected.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYet the actual number of transgender athletes seems to be almost immaterial. Any case of a transgender female athlete competing or even believed to be competing draws outsized attention, from Lia Thomas swimming for the University of Pennsylvania to the recently completed season of the San Jose State volleyball team.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",

The company's board members are expected to meet soon to deliberate on the next steps regarding the potential partnership.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIf called off, the decision would cast doubt on a deal that could have formed the world's third-largest automaker by sales. It also raises concerns about Nissan’s ability to navigate its ongoing financial and operational challenges without external support.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNews of the possible breakdown in talks had a positive impact on both companies' stock prices. On Wednesday, Honda’s shares rose over 2 per cent, while Nissan’s gained 1.6  per cent , contrasting with a slight dip in the broader Nikkei 225 index.  </div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tMerger talks faced growing differences  </h3>\n<div>\r\n\tHonda and Nissan, Japan's second- and third-largest automakers, respectively, announced last year that they were exploring a merger amid intensifying competition from China's BYD and emerging electric vehicle manufacturers. However, discussions have reportedly been strained by increasing disagreements, the news report said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNissan’s board is now set to review the situation following Honda’s suggestion that Nissan operate as its subsidiary — a move that deviates from the initial terms of their discussions, one source revealed.  </div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tHonda’s concerns over Nissan’s turnaround  </h3>\n<div>\r\n\tWith a market value nearly five times greater than Nissan’s, Honda has expressed concerns about its smaller rival’s progress in executing its turnaround strategy, a source noted.  </div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tEarlier, Japan's Asahi Shimbun reported that the merger was at risk of falling apart.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tNissan has faced significant challenges in adapting to the shift toward electric vehicles, struggling to recover from years of turmoil following the arrest of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn in 2018.  </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCompounding these difficulties, the company also faces potential trade disruptions, particularly from proposed US tariffs under former President Donald Trump. Analysts believe such tariffs could impact Nissan more severely than Honda or Toyota, given its reliance on production in Mexico.  </div>\n<h3>\r\n\tRenault's stance on the merger  </h3>\n<div>\r\n\tRenault, Nissan’s long-time alliance partner, had previously indicated openness to a potential deal with Honda. The French automaker holds a 36 per cent stake in Nissan, including 18.7 per cent through a French trust.  </div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div></div>",

Gold jewellery and coins continued to perform well, with a 27 per cent growth compared to the previous year. The Ebit margin for the jewellery division stood at 9.5 per cent, and after normalising for the impact of custom duties, the margin improved to 11.2 per cent.

Titan brand itself recorded an 18 per cent increase, while international brands saw a 30 per cent growth in retail sales. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHowever, the wearables segment saw a 20 per cent decline, with both average selling prices and volumes decreasing 8 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively.
