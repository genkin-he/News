However, he also highlighted potential challenges in enforcing such a law across India. He also stressed the need to ban non-vegetarian food across the country.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSpeaking to reporters outside the Parliament, Sinha touched upon the broader implications of UCC, particularly in relation to dietary restrictions.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHe remarked that while beef is banned in many parts of India, there are still regions—such as the northeast—where its consumption remains legal.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"Beef has been banned in many parts of the country.

He called for an all-party meeting to discuss its provisions and ensure that the legislation is drafted with inclusivity and fairness. \"Everyone should be consulted for their opinions and thoughts on the issue. The UCC should not be looked at as an election or vote-bank strategy but should be handled with care and caution,\" he emphasised.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tOn January 27, Uttarakhand became the first state in independent India to implement the UCC, a key electoral promise of the BJP. The new civil code mandates registration of all marriages and live-in relationships, while also ensuring equal property rights for sons and daughters, equal grounds for divorce, and legal legitimacy for children born from live-in relationships. To streamline the process, the Pushkar Dhami-led government has introduced an online portal for marriage, divorce, and inheritance registrations.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSinha’s remarks highlight the complexity of enforcing UCC nationwide, given India's diverse cultural and legal landscape.
