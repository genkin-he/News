            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\n<strong>By Ilena Peng, Kim Chipman and Michael Hirtzer</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tPresident Donald Trump’s plans to impose tariffs on some of the US’s largest agricultural trade partners next month threaten to upend markets and unleash food-price inflation.<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tMexico, Canada and China account for about half of all American agriculture exports, and the US has become increasingly reliant on its two neighbours for fruit and vegetables. Tariffs along with any retaliatory measures will curb overseas sales and increase energy and fertiliser costs for farmers. All of that will likely mean higher prices for consumers at grocery stores. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrump has set general levies of 25 per cent on Canada and Mexico, though agreements were reached on Monday to delay those by a month, while a tariff of 10 per cent is set for Chinese goods. Whether or not the tariffs end up being implemented, and exactly how the other countries might retaliate, will be key to what happens to commodity prices.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“These tariffs will only make it harder for American families to put food on the table and for American farmers and ranchers to sell their products,” said Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat and member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. “Farmers and ranchers want an even playing field, not handouts necessitated by another Trump trade war.”<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong class=\"read_more\">ALSO READ: <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-tariff-reversal-feeds-reputation-as-paper-tiger-on-trade-125020400119_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Donald Trump's tariff reversal feeds reputation as paper tiger on trade</a></strong></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWe break down the markets that are vulnerable to disruption. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Fruit and vegetables</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tMexico and Canada accounted for nearly 90 per cent of US fresh vegetable imports by value in 2023, and more than half of fresh fruit shipments, according to the US Department of Agriculture.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMexico is now the biggest source of US farm imports, shipping tomatoes, fresh berries and other vegetables. The country is a particularly big source of avocados, supplying more than 90 per cent of what Americans eat. Canada, meanwhile, ships apples, mushrooms and potatoes.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Corn and pork</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tMexico ranks as the biggest buyer of US corn and pork and any counter measures could hurt America’s biggest crop as well as meat companies such as Tyson Foods Inc. and Smithfield Foods Inc.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We’ve been preparing for this,” Tyson’s Chief Executive Officer Donnie King said during a conference call on Monday. “We’ll leverage our global expertise to identify the best markets for our products.”</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tStill, Mexico may find it hard to replace American corn. The Latin American nation imported almost 19 million metric tonnes last year. Both Mexico and Canada are also key importers of US dairy products.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Soybeans and Canola oil</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tSoybeans were the poster child for the last trade war with China, with the world’s biggest buyer shrinking US purchases by 79 per cent in the first two years of the first Trump administration. A repeat of those actions could hurt farmers.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTariffs also mean American biofuels, food and consumer-product makers may need to pay more for oilseed crop products used in everything from shampoo and salad dressing to renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. The US accounted for more than 90 per cent of Canada’s canola oil exports in 2023, according to the USDA.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Fertilisers</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tThe US is highly dependent on potash from Canada, importing roughly 85 per cent of what it needs. The Fertilizer Institute and US Senator Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, have already urged Trump to exempt Canadian product from tariffs.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAn exemption is especially important ahead of spring planting of grains that are relied on for global food supply chains, Fertilizer Institute Chief Executive Officer Corey Rosenbusch said in a statement.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Tariff costs are passed on to the end-user,” said Alexis Maxwell, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. US farmers will likely pay $60 to $80 more per short ton for potash and ammonia fertilizers this year, she added.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Lumber</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMore than 70 per cent of US imports of softwood lumber and gypsum, used in drywall, come from Canada and Mexico respectively, and “consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,” Carl Harris, chairman of the Washington-based National Association of Homebuilders, said in a statement.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCanada is the biggest foreign supplier of lumber to its southern neighbor, accounting for as much as 30 per cent of supplies. The new US tariffs will likely be in addition to existing duties, which were hiked to 14.5 per cent last summer, according to Dustin Jalbert, senior economist at commodity pricing agency Fastmarkets.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>",

But the US president’s willingness - at least for now - to hold off tariffs has underscored doubts over whether Trump, who famously obsesses over market performance, might once again prove a paper tiger on his more fiery trade threats. </div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrump could always reverse course again and press for more extreme measures, or impose the tariffs in a bid to offset the projected cost of some of his domestic agenda. </div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBut the deferrals are only likely to feed the US president’s growing reputation for stopping short of his bombast when it comes to trade, using the levies as a negotiating ploy. Even after Trump announced he was pushing ahead with his tariffs over the weekend, the slide in markets was contained as analysts predicted concessions that would limit their impact.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tStill, uncertainty swirls: Trump did not announce a pause on China tariffs, which have more support in his party, ahead of a planned phone call with President Xi Jinping later this week. He’s also pledged levies on the EU and key sectors. And Trump emphasised that the Mexican and Canadian pauses are only for a month, raising the prospect he could snap back the levies if he doesn’t see the outcomes he wants.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnd Trump’s moves, even if not fully implemented, have come with costs. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrump’s threats and the prospect of them becoming real dropped US stocks and the currencies of his targets, including the Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, euro, and South African rand. Each of those recovered as Trump delayed his Mexican threat, then his Canadian one. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMeanwhile in world capitals, leaders are taking stock of how to respond to the White House. Much of Canada’s Liberal Party leadership campaign to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has centered on how to take on Trump. And internationally minded businesses across the closest of US allies have been forced for weeks into reviewing their own supply chains.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Familiar concessions</strong><small class=\"brtag\"> </small></div>\n<div>\r\n\tIt all leaves unclear whether Trump is all bark on tariffs or whether he still aims to shift the US back toward an era a century ago when import levies were the chief source of revenue.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrump said he’d take part in ongoing talks toward a deal with Mexico, and conditioned a further Canada reprieve on whether they can reach a “final economic deal.” And he’s still threatening a host of other tariffs, including on the EU.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAllies of the president touted the concessions from Mexico — a deployment of 10,000 National Guard members to prevent drug trafficking and further talks on security and trade — as proof of Trump’s negotiating prowess. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBut they struck a familiar tone. Mexico agreed to dispatch 10,000 troops to its own southern border under President Joe Biden’s administration in 2021, and also dispatched several thousand troops to its southern border in 2019 amid similar pressure from Trump over migration. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCanada made a similar announcement — saying that “nearly 10,000 frontline personnel are and will be working on protecting the border” and pledging a handful of new measures, like C$200 million to fight organised crime and naming a fentanyl czar. Trump also praised a C$1.3 billion announcement Trudeau has previously made.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrudeau’s government scrambled to put together a border plan two months ago, after Trump first threatened tariffs over migration and fentanyl flows. Officials also repeatedly pointed out there is no evidence the border is a significant problem on these issues.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tBut as time passed with no deal, Canadian officials grew frustrated at the lack of information about what Trump was looking for, and raised doubts that fentanyl was his true motivation.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We’ve shown them and said that we’ll do what’s necessary to deal with this,” said Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc in a television interview Sunday. “But I wonder if that’s the actual pretext, or if there’s another policy objective that they’re pursuing.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Mexico about-face is virtually identical to Trump’s move in his first term, when he declared a national economic emergency and announced tariffs would go into effect in 2019 — and increase 5 per cent every month until Mexico take actions to address the illegal migration crisis.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe standoff between Trump and his Mexican counterpart took about a week until the president on June 7, 2019, announced in a social media post that he had “reached a signed agreement with Mexico” and tariffs scheduled to be implemented were “indefinitely suspended.”</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“Just like in 2019, Mexico came to the table in advance of those tariffs going into effect with commitments that sufficiently addressed the president’s concerns,” said Kelly Ann Shaw, a partner at Hogan Lovells who served as Trump’s deputy economic council director during his first term.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIt also mirrors his move last month to threaten tariffs on Colombia in a dispute over deportation flights, only to back off when the Latin American nation’s leader said he would pick up migrants with his own government plane rather than have them fly shackled on US military planes.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrump’s Saturday announcement that he would press ahead with 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, two of the largest US trading partners, shook markets. Equities slumped while oil rose and the US dollar strengthened amid fears the duties would kick off a wider trade war. Canada and Mexico each threatened retaliatory measures if Trump followed through. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTrump has threatened a range of other tariffs, though it’s not clear which, if any, he actually intends to implement. Those include duties on sectors like pharmaceuticals, chips, steel, aluminum, and copper; tariffs on the European Union; and a potential across-the-board global tariff that Trump has said should be “much bigger” than 2.5 per cent.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe president has long spoke about his desire to use tariffs more aggressively to fill government coffers, as he looks to cut taxes elsewhere, and get even with countries he perceives as ripping off the US. His decision to pause the Canada and Mexico tariffs leaves those goals unfulfilled for now.</div></div>",
