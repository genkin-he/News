            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p>\r\n\tSecretary of State Marco Rubio said Tuesday that El Salvador's offer to accept and jail violent American criminals raises clear legal issues but described it as very generous and said President Donald Trump would make a decision on whether to move forward with it.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tRubio reached an unusual agreement with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele a day earlier that the Central American country would accept US deportees of any nationality, including American citizens and legal residents who are imprisoned for violent crimes.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThere are obviously legalities involved. We have a Constitution, Rubio said at a news conference Tuesday in San Jose with Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves. But it's a very generous offer. No one's ever made an offer like that and to outsource, at a fraction of the cost, at least some of the most dangerous and violent criminals that we have in the United States. But obviously, the administration will have to make a decision.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tRubio discussed immigration with Chaves a Trump administration priority as America's top diplomat also faces major upheaval at the US Agency for International Development that has left many at the aid agency and the State Department fearful for their jobs.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhile Rubio has been on a five-country visit in Central America this week, USAID staffers and Democratic lawmakers were blocked from its Washington headquarters Monday after Elon Musk, who is running a budget-slashing Department of Government Efficiency, announced Trump had agreed with him to shut the aid agency.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThousands of USAID employees already had been laid off and programs worldwide shut down after Trump imposed a sweeping freeze on foreign assistance after taking office. Rubio later offered a waiver for life-saving programmes, but confusion over what is exempt from stop-work orders and fear of losing US aid permanently is still freezing aid and development work globally.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tI would say if some organisation is receiving funds from the United States and does not know how to apply a waiver, then I have real questions about the competence of that organization,\" he told reporters. Or I wonder whether they're deliberately sabotaging it for purposes of making a political point.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe also said he has long supported foreign aid. I continue to support foreign aid. But foreign aid is not charity. He noted that every dollar the US spends must advance its national interest.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOne programme hit is an HIV/AIDS programme started by Republican President George W Bush credited with saving more than 20 million lives in Africa and elsewhere. Aid contractors spoke of millions of dollars in medication and other goods stuck in port that they were forbidden to deliver.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAmid the turmoil back home, Rubio met in San Salvador with Bukele, who confirmed the deportation offer in a post on X, saying El Salvador has offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBukele said his country would accept only convicted criminals and would charge a fee that would be relatively low for the US but significant for us, making our entire prison system sustainable.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe State Department describes El Salvador's overcrowded prisons as harsh and dangerous. Its country information webpage says, In many facilities, provisions for sanitation, potable water, ventilation, temperature control, and lighting are inadequate or nonexistent.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tEl Salvador has lived under a state of emergency since March 2022, when the country's powerful street gangs went on a killing rampage. Bukele responded by suspending fundamental rights like access to lawyers, and authorities have arrested more than 83,000 people with little to no due process.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn 2023, Bukele opened a massive new prison with capacity for 40,000 gang members and cut prisoners' meals to twice a day. Prisoners there do not receive visits, and there are no programmes preparing them for reinsertion into society after their sentences and no workshops or educational programmes.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEl Salvador, once one of the most dangerous countries in the world, closed last year with a record low 114 homicides, a newfound security that has propelled Bukele's soaring popularity in the country of about 6 million residents.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tMigration has been the top issue for Rubio on his trip spanning Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic. But he was dogged by other changes that the Trump administration has been making soon after taking office.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tRubio told reporters in San Salvador that he was now the acting administrator of USAID but had delegated that authority so he would not be running its day-to-day operations.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn a letter Rubio sent to lawmakers that was obtained by The Associated Press, he said the State Department would work with Congress to reorganise and absorb certain bureaus, offices and missions of USAID.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tHe said the processes at the agency, which has been hit by Trump's freeze on all foreign assistance, are not well coordinated and that undermines the President's ability to carry out foreign relations.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn consultation with Congress, USAID may move, reorganise, and integrate certain missions, bureaus and offices into the Department of State, and the remainder of the Agency may be abolished consistent with applicable law, Rubio wrote.</p><p></p></div>",

Shinde became the chief minister of the state in June 2022 after he rebelled against Uddhav Thackeray and joined hands with the BJP. He remained the CM till November 2024. But after the assembly polls, Fadnavis took over as the chief minister for the third time. Fadnavis currently stays at 'Sagar' bungalow despite taking charge as chief minister in the first week of December. Dismissing Raut's claims, Fadnavis said, \"I will move into 'Varsha' bungalow once Eknath Shinde vacates it. Some minor repairs are also being carried out. In the meantime, my daughter, who is in Class 10, requested that we shift only after her exams. That is the reason I have not moved in yet.\"<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tRidiculing the claims, he said, \"These absurd rumours do not even deserve a response from someone at my level.\"<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tDeputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, who currently resides at Varsha, also commented on the controversy, saying, \"Those making these claims probably have more experience in such matters.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p></p></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p>\r\n\tA survey of water quality conducted in and around Nanded village, the epicentre of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) in Pune city, has found that there was lack chlorine in the drinking water supplied to the households of 26 patients of this nerve disorder, officials said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOn Tuesday, three fresh cases of GBS were reported in the city, taking the overall tally to 166, they said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOfficials of the Rapid Response Team (RRT), formed to probe the outbreak of the GBS cases in Nanded and adjoining localities on Sinhagad Road area, there are a total of 77 GBS patients in Nanded. Of them, the households of 62 patients were visited to take the samples of the drinking water. The findings of the house-to-house survey about lack of chlorine in drinking water was discussed in the meeting of the RRT. Experts have now urged the water supply department of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to take immediate action to maintain chlorine level of 0.2 PPM (parts per million) in the household water supply to ensure public health safety. \"While water at the source (well) was found to be adequately purified with sufficient chlorine levels, zero chlorine was detected in households of out 26 patients out of 62,\" an RRT member said.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe water supply department should take immediate action to maintain a minimum chlorine level of 0.2 ppm in household water supply, he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLast week, Maharashtra Health Minister Prakash Abitkar had disclosed that 80 per cent of the suspected GBS cases in Pune have been reported from areas located around a mega well in Nanded. He had also noted that high number of cases in certain areas appeared to be linked to suspected water contamination. When contacted, Nandkishor Jagtap, head of the civic body's water supply department, said the water from the well (in Nanded, which supplies to four to five villages) is adequately purified with sufficient chlorine levels. \"The reasons for having zero level of chlorine level could be that the households must be sourcing water from other sources, such as private tankers or non-cleaning of overhead water tanks at the residential society or individual household,\" he said. There is another reason that if the water is stored in large quantities, the levels of chlorine could go volatile, the official said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tJagtap said his department also collected some samples in which chlorine was not found in some samples and Escherichia coli or E-Coli bacteria was also found. \"After we found E coli in some of the water samples collected from the tankers, their operators have been issued notices and they have been instructed to use bleaching power solutions provided by the PMC to ensure that the bacteria is contained,\" he said. He added that some of the private water ATMs were seized after E coli was found in their samples. Meanwhile, Dr Radhakishan Pawar, deputy director of the state health department and chairman of the RRT, said the outbreak of GBS is subsiding now. \"There are around 165 cases, of which 77 are cluster cases which are from Nanded village area. Remaining cases are from other parts of Pune and other districts and they are not epidemiologically related to Nanded area. We consider these 77 cases in Nanded and adjoining areas as an outbreak as they are more than normal and accordingly, the investigations and sample collection of water, stool, poultry, food was going on,\" he said. A decline in the number of GBS cases has been observed now, he added.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\t\"There was a peak around January 18 and 19 but now a decline has been recorded,\" he said. GBS is a rare condition that causes sudden numbness and muscle weakness, with symptoms including severe weakness in the limbs.</p><p></p></div>",
