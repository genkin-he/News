The sharp decline in profitability caused a ripple effect in investor sentiment, leading to a drop in the company’s stock price.

The company’s management pointed to a global demand-supply imbalance as the primary cause of the weak pricing environment. Although realisations showed a slight improvement sequentially, they are still well below the desired levels, leading to concerns over the segment’s short-term profitability.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tTata Chemicals’ US operations have been particularly hit hard by plant production outages, further complicating the company’s ability to meet its revenue targets. Despite this, the management remains hopeful that pricing in the soda ash market will stabilise at lower levels over the coming months, particularly as demand picks up in markets such as India, Asia, and the US.

Motilal Oswal has downgraded its FY25 Ebitda estimates by 11 per cent, factoring in the weak performance in Q3, as well as the closure of the Lostock plant in the UK, which accounted for around 8 per cent of the company’s total revenue in FY24. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAdditionally, pricing pressures in the soda ash segment are expected to limit profitability in the near-term. As a result, Motilal Oswal has revised its Ebitda  estimates for FY26 and FY27 downward by 10 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively. The brokerage has maintained a ‘Neutral’ rating, with a reduced target price of Rs 1,030.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tSimilarly, Kotak Institutional Equities highlighted the company’s international operations’ margin pressures and the continuing weakness in pricing. While Tata Chemicals expects prices to eventually recover from their current depressed levels, Kotak Institutional Equities has sharply cut its earnings per share (EPS) estimates for FY25, slashing them by 26-34 per cent. The brokerage has also lowered its fair value (FV) estimate for Tata Chemicals to Rs 750 from Rs 840, maintaining a ‘Sell’ rating on the stock.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThat said, in the face of ongoing pricing pressures, rising costs, and production challenges, Tata Chemicals appears to be in for a challenging few months. </div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tWhile the company is optimistic that the soda ash market will recover over time, the road to recovery looks long, and investors may need to brace themselves for a continued period of volatility. </div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p>\r\n\tMoscow's renewed attacks on Ukraine's electricity infrastructure this winter have heightened scrutiny over the Ukrainian Energy Ministry's failure to protect the country's most critical energy facilities near nuclear power sites.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDespite more than a year of warnings that the sites were vulnerable to potential Russian attacks, the Energy Ministry failed to act swiftly, current and former Ukrainian officials in Kyiv told The Associated Press.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTwo years of punishing Russian strikes on its power grid have left Ukraine reliant on nuclear power for more than half of its electricity generation. Especially vulnerable are the unprotected nuclear switchyards located outside the perimeters of its three functioning nuclear plants, which are crucial to transmitting power from the reactors to the rest of the country.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe switchyards that handle electrical routing from nuclear power plants are a vital component of Ukraine's nuclear energy infrastructure powering homes, schools, hospitals, and other critical civilian infrastructure. Given Ukraine's heavy reliance on nuclear energy, military attacks on these switchyards would be devastating, severely impacting civilian life and undermining the resilience of the energy grid, said Marcy R. Fowler, head of the office for research and analysis at Open Nuclear Network, a programme of the US-based NGO PAX sapiens that focuses on reducing nuclear risk.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOnly in the fall, after Ukrainian intelligence agencies warned of potential Russian strikes targeting the nuclear switchyards, was action taken to begin building protection far too late in the event of an attack, analysts said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIf two (nuclear switchyards) are hit, we are out of supply for a minimum of 30 to 36 hours, and there will be a huge limitation on energy supply for at least three weeks, best-case scenario, said Oleksandr Kharchenko, a Ukrainian energy industry expert.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe said it would take three to five weeks to transport and install new equipment, a miserable scenario for Ukraine's people during the bitterly cold winter months.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEven more worrying, these nuclear switchyards also have a second critical function: delivering electricity to nuclear plants from the offsite grid that is essential to cooling their reactors and spent fuel. A disruption could potentially spell disaster, the U.N. nuclear agency has repeatedly warned since the Russian attacks began in August.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAnd while Ukraine's nuclear plants have backup emergency power systems, these are designed to provide temporary support, Fowler said. Without functioning switchyards, the backup systems alone would not be sufficient to sustain operations or prevent safety risks during an extended outage.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLawmakers cited failure to protect these sites in a resolution calling for the removal of Energy Minister Herman Haluschenko last month. The list of grievances, which also censured Haluschenko for alleged systematic corruption and inadequate oversight of the energy sector, must still be voted on by parliament.</p>\n<h3>\r\n\tDelays in fortifying nuclear switchyards</h3>\n<p>\r\n\tRussian attacks in November and December came dangerously close to the country's nuclear power plants, causing five out of its nine operating reactors to reduce power generation.

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p>\r\n\tMoscow's renewed attacks on Ukraine's electricity infrastructure this winter have heightened scrutiny over the Ukrainian Energy Ministry's failure to protect the country's most critical energy facilities near nuclear power sites.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDespite more than a year of warnings that the sites were vulnerable to potential Russian attacks, the Energy Ministry failed to act swiftly, current and former Ukrainian officials in Kyiv told The Associated Press.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTwo years of punishing Russian strikes on its power grid have left Ukraine reliant on nuclear power for more than half of its electricity generation. Especially vulnerable are the unprotected nuclear switchyards located outside the perimeters of its three functioning nuclear plants, which are crucial to transmitting power from the reactors to the rest of the country.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe switchyards that handle electrical routing from nuclear power plants are a vital component of Ukraine's nuclear energy infrastructure powering homes, schools, hospitals, and other critical civilian infrastructure. Given Ukraine's heavy reliance on nuclear energy, military attacks on these switchyards would be devastating, severely impacting civilian life and undermining the resilience of the energy grid, said Marcy R. Fowler, head of the office for research and analysis at Open Nuclear Network, a programme of the US-based NGO PAX sapiens that focuses on reducing nuclear risk.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOnly in the fall, after Ukrainian intelligence agencies warned of potential Russian strikes targeting the nuclear switchyards, was action taken to begin building protection far too late in the event of an attack, analysts said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIf two (nuclear switchyards) are hit, we are out of supply for a minimum of 30 to 36 hours, and there will be a huge limitation on energy supply for at least three weeks, best-case scenario, said Oleksandr Kharchenko, a Ukrainian energy industry expert.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe said it would take three to five weeks to transport and install new equipment, a miserable scenario for Ukraine's people during the bitterly cold winter months.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEven more worrying, these nuclear switchyards also have a second critical function: delivering electricity to nuclear plants from the offsite grid that is essential to cooling their reactors and spent fuel. A disruption could potentially spell disaster, the U.N. nuclear agency has repeatedly warned since the Russian attacks began in August.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tAnd while Ukraine's nuclear plants have backup emergency power systems, these are designed to provide temporary support, Fowler said. Without functioning switchyards, the backup systems alone would not be sufficient to sustain operations or prevent safety risks during an extended outage.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLawmakers cited failure to protect these sites in a resolution calling for the removal of Energy Minister Herman Haluschenko last month. The list of grievances, which also censured Haluschenko for alleged systematic corruption and inadequate oversight of the energy sector, must still be voted on by parliament.</p>\n<h3>\r\n\tDelays in fortifying nuclear switchyards</h3>\n<p>\r\n\tRussian attacks in November and December came dangerously close to the country's nuclear power plants, causing five out of its nine operating reactors to reduce power generation. The attacks did not strike the nuclear switchyards about a kilometer (half-mile) away from reactor sites but came alarmingly close.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe task of building protections for energy transmission substations, both nuclear and non-nuclear, fell to state and private companies, with the Energy Ministry supervising.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThree layers of fortifications were ordered: sandbags followed by cement barricades capable of withstanding drone attacks and the most costly and least complete iron-and-steel-fortified structures.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFollowing a government decree in July 2023, many state energy companies began immediately contracting to build first- and second-layer fortifications for their most critical power facilities.

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><p>\r\n\tIn 2022, Salman Rushdie was about to deliver a lecture before a live audience in western New York when a man ran towards him and plunged a knife into the author's hand as he raised it in self-defence.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAfter that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, everywhere, Rushdie recalled in a memoir that followed. I feel my legs give way, and I fall.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn the coming weeks, Rushdie is expected to return to the same New York county to recount the experience as one of the first witnesses in the trial of the man charged with wielding the knife that day, Hadi Matar.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tJury selection is scheduled to begin Tuesday. Matar, 27, of Fairview, New Jersey, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder and assault.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tUnder different circumstances, Rushdie's book, which details his account of that day and his recovery, might offer important evidence in the Aug. 12, 2022, attack that left the 77-year-old blind in his right eye and his hand permanently damaged.</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tBut this isn't a back alley event that occurs unwitnessed in a dark alley, said Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt following a pretrial hearing. This is something that was recorded, it was witnessed live by thousands of people.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tJurors will be shown video of the attack, as well as still pictures and documentation, Schmidt has said. An estimated 15 witnesses are expected to take the stand over the course of a trial that is projected to last several weeks, he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMatar's lawyer, Nathaniel Barone, has not detailed how he plans to defend his client against the charges. He has clapped back at critics who question why Matar did not take a plea deal in light of the prosecution's case.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThat's not what this is about. It's about due process,\" Barone said. It's about receiving a fair trial ... If someone wants to exercise those rights, they're entitled to do that.\"<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\r\n\tIn a separate indictment, federal authorities allege that Matar was motivated by a terrorist organisation's endorsement of a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie's death.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tA separate trial on the federal charges terrorism transcending national boundaries, providing material support to terrorists and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organisation will be scheduled in US District Court in Buffalo.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tRushdie spent years in hiding after the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa in 1989 after publication of the novel The Satanic Verses, which some Muslims consider blasphemous. In the federal indictment, authorities allege Matar believed the edict was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group's then-leader, Hassan Nasrallah.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBut jurors in the Chautauqua County case are unlikely to hear about the fatwa, according to Schmidt. He has said he doesn't anticipate needing to show Matar's possible motive to get a conviction on the state charges.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tFrom my standpoint, this is a localized event. It's a stabbing event. It's fairly straightforward, Schmidt said. I don't really see a need to get into motive evidence, whether that's applicable or not applicable and what that consists of. I'd like to avoid all of that.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBarone, the defence attorney, said jurors should be screened for any prejudice against people of Middle Eastern descent nonetheless, given the discussions of the fatwa during previous court proceedings.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThey've talked about the reason why this alleged crime supposedly occurred was because of this book involving Muslims, all that. So it's kind of like the barn door's been opened, he said.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tMatar was born in the US but holds dual citizenship in Lebanon, where his parents were born.

Netanyahu is in the middle of weekslong testimony in an ongoing corruption trial that centres on allegations he exchanged favours with media moguls and wealthy associates. He has decried the accusations and said he is the victim of a witch hunt.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tBeing seen with Trump, who is popular in Israel, could help distract the public from the trial and boost Netanyahu's standing.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt's Netanyahu's first travel outside Israel since the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants in November for him, his former defense minister and Hamas' military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity during the war in Gaza. The US does not recognise the ICC's authority over its citizens or territory.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNetanyahu and Trump's Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff on Monday began the daunting work of brokering the next phase of a ceasefire agreement.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBut Netanyahu is under intense pressure from hard-right members of his governing coalition to abandon the ceasefire and resume fighting in Gaza to eliminate Hamas. Bezalel Smotrich, one of Netanyahu's key partners, vows to topple the government if the war isn't relaunched, a step that could lead to early elections.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tHamas, which has reasserted control over Gaza since the ceasefire began last month, has said it will not release hostages in the second phase without an end to the war and Israeli forces' full withdrawal. Netanyahu, meanwhile, maintains that Israel is committed to victory over Hamas and the return of all hostages captured in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMira Resnick, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Israeli and Palestinian affairs, said Trump may have little patience for political woes of Netanyahu if it gets in the way of the broader goals of this administration.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe president started his term by saying that he wanted the ceasefire to be in place by Jan. 20. That's what he got,\" Resnick said. \"He is invested in this because he was able to take credit for it.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEinav Zangauker, whose son Matan is among the hostages, called on Trump to use American leverage to keep Netanyahu committed to the agreement.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMatan, 24, is among those who are expected to be included in the second phase of the deal, when all remaining living hostages including men under the age of 50 and male soldiers are to be exchanged for a yet-to-be-determined number of Palestinian prisoners. The second phase is also expected to include the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tI want President Trump to know there are certain extreme elements from within Israel who are trying to torpedo his vision, said Zangauker, who travelled to Washington from Israel to join a planned Tuesday rally outside the White House. We are representative of the vast, vast majority of Israel. The ultra-extremists are blackmailing the prime minister to do their bidding.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSince returning to office, Trump has called for relocating Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Egypt and Jordan, even as Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Jordanian King Abdullah II have rejected it. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League have joined Egypt and Jordan in rejecting plans to move Palestinians out of their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tYet Trump insists he can persuade Egypt and Jordan to come around to accept displaced Palestinians because of the significant aid that the US provides Cairo and Amman. Hard-line right-wing members of Netanyahu's government have embraced the call to move displaced Palestinians out of Gaza.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tShibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat Professor for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland, said the push by Trump to move Palestinians out of Gaza is helpful to Netanyahu. But he added that it undercuts Trump and Netanyahu's desire to land a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Saudis, the biggest Arab power in the Middle East, have said they would only agree to such a deal if the war ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThis push by Trump doesn't square with the idea of a Palestinian state as we know it, Telhami said. It's hard to see the Saudis going along with it.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNetanyahu on Monday met with Trump's pick to serve as ambassador to Israel, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, and evangelical leaders. Huckabee has long rejected a Palestinian state in territory previously seized by Israel.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe prime minister is also expected to press Trump to take decisive action on Iran. Tehran has faced a series of military setbacks, including Israeli forces significantly degrading Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon as well as an operation that decimated Iran's air defences. The moment, Netanyahu believes, has created a window to decisively address Tehran's nuclear programme.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThis is one of the most important and critical meetings between an American president and an Israeli prime minister, said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on US-Israel relations at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv. What's at stake here is not just bilateral relations between Israel and the United States but the reshaping of the Middle East.</p><p></p></div>",
