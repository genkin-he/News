Shanmugam said the Bill brought these powers together in one place, while affirming the importance of racial harmony in the multi-ethnic city-state.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe new law empowers the authorities to issue restraining orders against individuals involved in making content that prejudices Singapore's racial harmony, taking close reference from the existing Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act (MRHA).</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIt also introduces a community remedial initiative, which gives those who have committed less egregious race-related offences a chance to mend community ties in lieu of prosecution.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"We have always treated racial harmony as being fundamental in Singapore, and so this Bill has to be seen in that context, Shanmugam said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Multiracialism, underpinned by racial harmony, is a foundational principle for us,\" local media reports had the Minister as saying in the house.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tDuring the debate on the bill, Shanmugam sought to allay concerns that the legislative changes would curtail free speech.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMembers of parliament had raised concerns that the Government's new power to issue restraining orders could stifle legitimate discourse and sought clarity on scenarios where this power would be used.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMinister Shanmugam said the best evidence of how these powers are likely to be used is how the Government has used similar powers it has had since the MRHA was enacted in 1990.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNo orders have been issued under the MRHA to date, but the legal framework means everyone understands what is not allowed in Singapore, he added.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\t\"That gives you an indication of how the Government approaches these powers. The important thing is to have the powers, but also to be very, very careful and judicious in how you use them, he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Minister cited a previous case where a preacher made highly disparaging remarks on YouTube about Buddhism and Taoism. Officials spoke to the preacher, who agreed to withdraw his remarks.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"We didn't need to resort to issuing an order... the fact that we had the power helped, and after that, others took reference from that (case), Shanmugam said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tShanmugam said the scope of unacceptable conduct regarding race relations remains substantively the same, as offences under the new law cover what is already in the Penal Code.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tReferring to online comments that call for 'Palestine to be free', the Minister pointed out that these are not calls for violence here but expressions of opinion.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tResponding to a question, Shanmugam said acts that did not flout existing racial harmony laws will still not be offences, but added that there are other laws governing protected places and which regulate public assemblies.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"I would suggest, therefore, a careful understanding of the (Bill's) provisions. Otherwise, there is a serious risk that the public may be misled, he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tShanmugam noted that the new law has safeguards in place beyond the minister who issues the restraining order, as such an application would have to be sent to a new Presidential Council for Racial and Religious Harmony, which will make recommendations to the president on whether to confirm, cancel or vary the order.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Minister said he agreed entirely that Singapore must remain open, and a consistent message by government leaders here over the last 60 years is that the nation must be open and interact with the world.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYet, it also means that groups like clan associations can potentially be vectors of influence from countries that want to influence Singapore's politics, he added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe authorities have engaged many race-based entities here, and they understand and accept the need for such safeguards, said Shanmugam.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe intent is to safeguard from malicious foreign influence, not to curtail legitimate exchanges, business deals or trade promotion activities conducted by our clan or business associations, he added.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tGerald Giam, a member of parliament from the opposition Workers' Party had expressed concern that genuine dialogue about racial issues will be curtailed under the new Act, citing the examples of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe scope of unacceptable conduct regarding race relations will remain substantially the same as today. There is, in fact, no change in the law, said Shanmugam.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSome updates will be made to align the language and defences under the Bill with the equal provision. So, the changes are that we actually provided for some additional defences, and in fact, narrowed one of the provisions.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe agree entirely that Singapore must remain open. We must be able to reach out to the world. In fact, we have to for our success, said Shanmugam, responding to a question about the new Act deterring clans and business associations from interacting with foreigners and foreign entities altogether.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tEconomically, we'll be finished if we don't interact. Socially, we are such a small place, we need to get ideas from outside, and then we need to adapt the ideas that work for us to our own situations, Channel News Asia quoted the Minister as responding to concerns raised by parliamentarians.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe main issue, he noted, is that those groups could potentially be vectors of influence from countries that want to influence our politics. Evidence from around the world gives Singapore some reasons to be concerned about this, said Shanmugam.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe likened the safeguards under the new Act to the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act, which subjects MPs and Cabinet ministers to similar measures, to prevent them from being used in the same way by foreign actors.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tNothing in the Bill is meant to suggest that foreign influence is in itself undesirable, and designation under this Bill as a race-based entity does not imply any wrongdoing, said Shanmugam.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt simply means that the entities or the entity has engaged in activities that relate to race, which sometimes is its raison d'etre.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tShanmugam emphasised that such clans and associations are important for Singapore. They play a constructive role in building social bonds and preserving traditions and cultures while strengthening business networks too, he said.</p><p></p></div>",

Shanmugam said the Bill brought these powers together in one place, while affirming the importance of racial harmony in the multi-ethnic city-state.</p><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe new law empowers the authorities to issue restraining orders against individuals involved in making content that prejudices Singapore's racial harmony, taking close reference from the existing Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act (MRHA).</p><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<p>\r\n\tIt also introduces a community remedial initiative, which gives those who have committed less egregious race-related offences a chance to mend community ties in lieu of prosecution.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"We have always treated racial harmony as being fundamental in Singapore, and so this Bill has to be seen in that context, Shanmugam said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"Multiracialism, underpinned by racial harmony, is a foundational principle for us,\" local media reports had the Minister as saying in the house.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tDuring the debate on the bill, Shanmugam sought to allay concerns that the legislative changes would curtail free speech.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMembers of parliament had raised concerns that the Government's new power to issue restraining orders could stifle legitimate discourse and sought clarity on scenarios where this power would be used.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMinister Shanmugam said the best evidence of how these powers are likely to be used is how the Government has used similar powers it has had since the MRHA was enacted in 1990.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNo orders have been issued under the MRHA to date, but the legal framework means everyone understands what is not allowed in Singapore, he added.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\t\"That gives you an indication of how the Government approaches these powers. The important thing is to have the powers, but also to be very, very careful and judicious in how you use them, he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Minister cited a previous case where a preacher made highly disparaging remarks on YouTube about Buddhism and Taoism. Officials spoke to the preacher, who agreed to withdraw his remarks.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"We didn't need to resort to issuing an order... the fact that we had the power helped, and after that, others took reference from that (case), Shanmugam said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tShanmugam said the scope of unacceptable conduct regarding race relations remains substantively the same, as offences under the new law cover what is already in the Penal Code.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tReferring to online comments that call for 'Palestine to be free', the Minister pointed out that these are not calls for violence here but expressions of opinion.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tResponding to a question, Shanmugam said acts that did not flout existing racial harmony laws will still not be offences, but added that there are other laws governing protected places and which regulate public assemblies.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"I would suggest, therefore, a careful understanding of the (Bill's) provisions. Otherwise, there is a serious risk that the public may be misled, he said.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tShanmugam noted that the new law has safeguards in place beyond the minister who issues the restraining order, as such an application would have to be sent to a new Presidential Council for Racial and Religious Harmony, which will make recommendations to the president on whether to confirm, cancel or vary the order.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Minister said he agreed entirely that Singapore must remain open, and a consistent message by government leaders here over the last 60 years is that the nation must be open and interact with the world.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYet, it also means that groups like clan associations can potentially be vectors of influence from countries that want to influence Singapore's politics, he added.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe authorities have engaged many race-based entities here, and they understand and accept the need for such safeguards, said Shanmugam.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe intent is to safeguard from malicious foreign influence, not to curtail legitimate exchanges, business deals or trade promotion activities conducted by our clan or business associations, he added.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tGerald Giam, a member of parliament from the opposition Workers' Party had expressed concern that genuine dialogue about racial issues will be curtailed under the new Act, citing the examples of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe scope of unacceptable conduct regarding race relations will remain substantially the same as today. There is, in fact, no change in the law, said Shanmugam.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSome updates will be made to align the language and defences under the Bill with the equal provision. So, the changes are that we actually provided for some additional defences, and in fact, narrowed one of the provisions.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe agree entirely that Singapore must remain open. We must be able to reach out to the world. In fact, we have to for our success, said Shanmugam, responding to a question about the new Act deterring clans and business associations from interacting with foreigners and foreign entities altogether.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_8-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tEconomically, we'll be finished if we don't interact. Socially, we are such a small place, we need to get ideas from outside, and then we need to adapt the ideas that work for us to our own situations, Channel News Asia quoted the Minister as responding to concerns raised by parliamentarians.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe main issue, he noted, is that those groups could potentially be vectors of influence from countries that want to influence our politics. Evidence from around the world gives Singapore some reasons to be concerned about this, said Shanmugam.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHe likened the safeguards under the new Act to the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act, which subjects MPs and Cabinet ministers to similar measures, to prevent them from being used in the same way by foreign actors.</p><div id=\"between_article_content_9-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<p>\r\n\tNothing in the Bill is meant to suggest that foreign influence is in itself undesirable, and designation under this Bill as a race-based entity does not imply any wrongdoing, said Shanmugam.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt simply means that the entities or the entity has engaged in activities that relate to race, which sometimes is its raison d'etre.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tShanmugam emphasised that such clans and associations are important for Singapore. They play a constructive role in building social bonds and preserving traditions and cultures while strengthening business networks too, he said.</p><p></p></div>",

Both the Aga Khan Foundation and the Ismaili religious community shared this news on their websites. An announcement regarding his successor will be made at a later time. He is survived by three sons and one daughter.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tA legacy of leadership</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tPrince Karim Aga Khan IV, viewed by his followers as a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, became the community leader at a young age. His grandfather passed over his father in favour of him, believing that a younger leader would be better suited for guiding the Ismaili Muslim diaspora in the modern era.</div>\n<h3>\r\n\tA distinguished title and early leadership</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tIn July 1957, Queen Elizabeth bestowed the title \"His Highness\" upon him. This came shortly after Aga Khan III, his grandfather, named him heir to the 1,300-year-old dynasty of the Ismaili Muslim community. He officially became Aga Khan IV on October 19, 1957, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania — the same location where his grandfather had once received gifts worth his weight in diamonds.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHaving left Harvard to be with his ailing grandfather, the Aga Khan returned to his studies after 18 months, now accompanied by an entourage and a deep sense of responsibility.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tRacehorse owner and billionaire</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tApart from his religious leadership, Aga Khan IV became synonymous with success in horse racing, owning the famous thoroughbred Shergar. His lifestyle was equally extravagant, marked by private jets, a $200 million super-yacht, and a private island in the Bahamas. His wealth was estimated to range from $800 million to $13 billion, stemming from his family inheritance, horse breeding business, and investments in tourism and real estate.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tCommitment to global philanthropy</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Aga Khan, who held citizenship in Britain, France, Switzerland, and Portugal, used his wealth to improve conditions in impoverished parts of the world. In a 2007 interview with The New York Times, he stated that poverty often leads to desperation and extremism, and that by assisting the poor through business, he was helping prevent these issues.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe scope of the Aga Khan’s financial empire is difficult to gauge, with some estimates placing his wealth in the billions. His community of Ismailis, originally based in India, considers it a religious duty to contribute up to 10 per cent of their income to him as their steward.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tThe Ismailis</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Ismailis are a distinct sect within Shia Islam, emerging in the 8th century from a schism regarding the rightful succession of leadership after the Prophet Muhammad's death. They derive their name from Imam Isma'il ibn Jafar, whom they recognise as the seventh Imam. This group emphasises the esoteric interpretation of Islam, focusing on the deeper, allegorical meanings of the Quran, which sets them apart from more literalist Islamic sects.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIsmailism developed during a period of significant political and religious upheaval in the Islamic world. Following the death of Muhammad ibn Isma'il, the movement evolved, leading to the establishment of the Fatimid Caliphate in the 10th century, which marked a peak in Ismaili political power and cultural influence.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIsmaili beliefs centre on the concept of an ongoing spiritual leadership through a line of Imams believed to be divinely appointed. The current leader is Karim Aga Khan IV, who plays a significant role in promoting social development and interfaith dialogue within and outside the community. The Ismailis practice a unique form of worship that differs from mainstream Islamic practices; for instance, they pray three times a day instead of five.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tToday, Ismailis are spread across more than 25 countries worldwide, with significant populations in India, Pakistan, Syria, Iran, and Canada. Their history in these regions often dates back over a millennium.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<em>(With agency inputs)</em></div></div>",

This has become possible due to revised tax slabs and an enhanced rebate of Rs 60,000 under section 87A. However, ever since the announcement of revised tax slabs and rates under the new tax regime for FY 2025-26, there has been a lot of confusion about tax on incomes slightly above Rs 12 lakh.

This relief ensures that your total tax liability doesn’t exceed the tax you would have paid if your income were exactly Rs 12 lakh.

For Rs 12.1 lakh, the excess income is Rs 10,000.

Although his income exceeds Rs 12 lakh, he’s not eligible for a rebate under Section 87A. Without marginal relief, his tax liability would be Rs 63,750. However, due to marginal relief, he pays only Rs 25,000, plus a 4% cess, making his final tax Rs 26,000.

Both the Aga Khan Foundation and the Ismaili religious community shared this news on their websites. An announcement regarding his successor will be made at a later time. He is survived by three sons and one daughter.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tA legacy of leadership</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tPrince Karim Aga Khan IV, viewed by his followers as a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, became the community leader at a young age. His grandfather passed over his father in favour of him, believing that a younger leader would be better suited for guiding the Ismaili Muslim diaspora in the modern era.</div>\n<h3>\r\n\tA distinguished title and early leadership</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tIn July 1957, Queen Elizabeth bestowed the title \"His Highness\" upon him. This came shortly after Aga Khan III, his grandfather, named him heir to the 1,300-year-old dynasty of the Ismaili Muslim community. He officially became Aga Khan IV on October 19, 1957, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania — the same location where his grandfather had once received gifts worth his weight in diamonds.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHaving left Harvard to be with his ailing grandfather, the Aga Khan returned to his studies after 18 months, now accompanied by an entourage and a deep sense of responsibility.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tRacehorse owner and billionaire</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tApart from his religious leadership, Aga Khan IV became synonymous with success in horse racing, owning the famous thoroughbred Shergar. His lifestyle was equally extravagant, marked by private jets, a $200 million super-yacht, and a private island in the Bahamas. His wealth was estimated to range from $800 million to $13 billion, stemming from his family inheritance, horse breeding business, and investments in tourism and real estate.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tCommitment to global philanthropy</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Aga Khan, who held citizenship in Britain, France, Switzerland, and Portugal, used his wealth to improve conditions in impoverished parts of the world. In a 2007 interview with The New York Times, he stated that poverty often leads to desperation and extremism, and that by assisting the poor through business, he was helping prevent these issues.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe scope of the Aga Khan’s financial empire is difficult to gauge, with some estimates placing his wealth in the billions. His community of Ismailis, originally based in India, considers it a religious duty to contribute up to 10 per cent of their income to him as their steward.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tThe Ismailis</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Ismailis are a distinct sect within Shia Islam, emerging in the 8th century from a schism regarding the rightful succession of leadership after the Prophet Muhammad's death. They derive their name from Imam Isma'il ibn Jafar, whom they recognise as the seventh Imam. This group emphasises the esoteric interpretation of Islam, focusing on the deeper, allegorical meanings of the Quran, which sets them apart from more literalist Islamic sects.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIsmailism developed during a period of significant political and religious upheaval in the Islamic world. Following the death of Muhammad ibn Isma'il, the movement evolved, leading to the establishment of the Fatimid Caliphate in the 10th century, which marked a peak in Ismaili political power and cultural influence.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIsmaili beliefs centre on the concept of an ongoing spiritual leadership through a line of Imams believed to be divinely appointed. The current leader is Karim Aga Khan IV, who plays a significant role in promoting social development and interfaith dialogue within and outside the community. The Ismailis practice a unique form of worship that differs from mainstream Islamic practices; for instance, they pray three times a day instead of five.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tToday, Ismailis are spread across more than 25 countries worldwide, with significant populations in India, Pakistan, Syria, Iran, and Canada. Their history in these regions often dates back over a millennium.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<em>(With agency inputs)</em></div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\n<strong>ACME Solar share price: </strong>Recently-listed solar energy company ACME Solar Holdings shares were buzzing in trade on Wednesday, February 5, 2025, as the scrip zoomed as much as 7.77 per cent to hit an intraday high of Rs 223.75 per share. ACME Solar made its stock market debut on November 13, 2024.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe uptick in ACME Solar share price came after domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal initiated coverage with ‘Buy’ rating for a target price of Rs 330, which reflects an upside potential of 58.95 per cent from the previous close (Feb 4) of Rs 207.60.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We initiate coverage on ACME with a ‘Buy’ rating. We assign an EV/Ebitda multiple of 11x to FY28E Ebitda. Adjusting for net debt, we derive our TP of Rs 330, implying a 59 per upside potential. Our EV/Ebitda multiple is at a discount to competitors, such as NTPC Green, which is trading at ~14x FY28 EV/Ebitda. Further, the Street is currently attributing 15x EV/Ebitda to the renewable businesses of JSWE and Tata Power,” Motilal Oswal said in a note.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnalysts at Motilal Oswal believe ACME Solar’s steep valuation discount compared to NTPC Green is unsustainable and should narrow in the coming quarters. They also noted that NTPC Green’s premium valuation is largely due to its lower financing costs (up to a 2 per interest rate advantage). However, this advantage is somewhat reduced as NTPC Green outsources both EPC and O&amp;M for its projects, whereas other players handle these functions in-house.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<em><strong>Given this, here are the top factors behind initiating coverage on ACME Solar share:</strong></em></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Diversified renewable energy portfolio</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnalysts said ACME Solar’s diversified portfolio includes ~7GW of renewable capacity (solar, wind, hybrid, and firm &amp; dispatchable renewable energy). With 86 per cent of its portfolio contracted with central off-takers like SECI, NTPC, and NHPC, the company ensures minimal counterparty risk. The portfolio consists of 49 per solar, 2 per wind, and 49 per hybrid/FDRE projects.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Strong Ebitda growth eyed</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMotilal Oswal analysts noted that ACME Solar is set for strong earnings growth, with an estimated Ebitda CAGR of 52 per from FY24 to FY27. The company’s operational capacity is set to triple by FY27, and it continues to secure new projects, having won 1.9GW of new orders in FY25 so far.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>High visibility with PPAs in place </strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe company has already signed PPAs for 100 per of its FY26 and 83 per of its FY27 capacity. This gives the company high visibility for future revenue streams. Additionally, it has secured grid connectivity for all under-construction projects, easing concerns about grid availability.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Focus on High-IRR, complex projects </strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tACME Solar’s growing focus on complex projects, like FDRE and hybrid systems, positions it well for strong returns (mid-to-high teens IRRs) as competition in traditional solar and wind projects has increased. The company’s investment in wind energy also sets it apart from competitors.</div>\n<div>\r\n\t“ACME is one of the few players building wind capabilities. This gives the company an edge over peers, such as NTPC Green, which is less focused on wind energy,” Motilal Oswal analysts said, in a note.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Capital and growth funding plans </strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnalysts noted that the company plans to fund its pipeline through a combination of project debt, operating cash flow, and debt refinancing. With major capex planned for FY25-27, the company has already secured debt for 1.7GW of projects, and operating cash flow is expected to remain strong, aiding growth financing.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Key risks</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThough ACME Solar remains confident in signing PPAs for all its under-construction projects, the increasing competitive pressure in the RE sector, especially for plain solar/wind projects, poses a risk. However, the company’s focus on complex projects with higher IRRs mitigates some of this risk.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAt 10:11 AM, ACME Solar share price was trading 6.65 per cent higher at Rs 221.40 per share. In comparison, BSE Sensex was trading 0.14 per cent lower at 78,471.32 levels.</div></div>",
