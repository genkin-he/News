If you want to bring in the 300-400 million people who are not digitally savvy onto the digital platform, there has to be some incentivisation,” Asbe said.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tCurrently, there is no merchant discount rate (MDR) on UPI payments. MDR refers to a fee that merchants pay to payment processing companies for processing a transaction. Debit transactions made on UPI continue to remain free and banks along with fintechs bear the costs of processing these payments. </div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Union Budget 2025 too was muted on digital payment subsidies that trickle down to banks and financial technology (fintech) firms. The government slashed the financial year 2026 (FY26) outlay for promoting peer-to-merchant (P2M) UPI transactions and RuPay debit card payments.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Centre allocated just Rs 437 crore in the Budget for the promotion of these types of transactions. This was a 78 per cent cut from the final outlay of Rs 2,000 crore allocated for FY25.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAsbe elucidated that investments in technology and consumer education awareness were a continuous process. “The use of tech can identify the early trends in terms of future potential risk. How do you continuously remain vigilant and make over and above investments which are required to ensure that the trust in the payment system is protected?” he asked. </div>\n<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small></div>",
