Both the Aga Khan Foundation and the Ismaili religious community shared this news on their websites. An announcement regarding his successor will be made at a later time. He is survived by three sons and one daughter.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tA legacy of leadership</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tPrince Karim Aga Khan IV, viewed by his followers as a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, became the community leader at a young age. His grandfather passed over his father in favour of him, believing that a younger leader would be better suited for guiding the Ismaili Muslim diaspora in the modern era.</div>\n<h3>\r\n\tA distinguished title and early leadership</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tIn July 1957, Queen Elizabeth bestowed the title \"His Highness\" upon him. This came shortly after Aga Khan III, his grandfather, named him heir to the 1,300-year-old dynasty of the Ismaili Muslim community. He officially became Aga Khan IV on October 19, 1957, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania — the same location where his grandfather had once received gifts worth his weight in diamonds.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tHaving left Harvard to be with his ailing grandfather, the Aga Khan returned to his studies after 18 months, now accompanied by an entourage and a deep sense of responsibility.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tRacehorse owner and billionaire</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tApart from his religious leadership, Aga Khan IV became synonymous with success in horse racing, owning the famous thoroughbred Shergar. His lifestyle was equally extravagant, marked by private jets, a $200 million super-yacht, and a private island in the Bahamas. His wealth was estimated to range from $800 million to $13 billion, stemming from his family inheritance, horse breeding business, and investments in tourism and real estate.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tCommitment to global philanthropy</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Aga Khan, who held citizenship in Britain, France, Switzerland, and Portugal, used his wealth to improve conditions in impoverished parts of the world. In a 2007 interview with The New York Times, he stated that poverty often leads to desperation and extremism, and that by assisting the poor through business, he was helping prevent these issues.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe scope of the Aga Khan’s financial empire is difficult to gauge, with some estimates placing his wealth in the billions. His community of Ismailis, originally based in India, considers it a religious duty to contribute up to 10 per cent of their income to him as their steward.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tThe Ismailis</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Ismailis are a distinct sect within Shia Islam, emerging in the 8th century from a schism regarding the rightful succession of leadership after the Prophet Muhammad's death. They derive their name from Imam Isma'il ibn Jafar, whom they recognise as the seventh Imam. This group emphasises the esoteric interpretation of Islam, focusing on the deeper, allegorical meanings of the Quran, which sets them apart from more literalist Islamic sects.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIsmailism developed during a period of significant political and religious upheaval in the Islamic world. Following the death of Muhammad ibn Isma'il, the movement evolved, leading to the establishment of the Fatimid Caliphate in the 10th century, which marked a peak in Ismaili political power and cultural influence.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIsmaili beliefs centre on the concept of an ongoing spiritual leadership through a line of Imams believed to be divinely appointed. The current leader is Karim Aga Khan IV, who plays a significant role in promoting social development and interfaith dialogue within and outside the community. The Ismailis practice a unique form of worship that differs from mainstream Islamic practices; for instance, they pray three times a day instead of five.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tToday, Ismailis are spread across more than 25 countries worldwide, with significant populations in India, Pakistan, Syria, Iran, and Canada. Their history in these regions often dates back over a millennium.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<em>(With agency inputs)</em></div></div>",

This has become possible due to revised tax slabs and an enhanced rebate of Rs 60,000 under section 87A. However, ever since the announcement of revised tax slabs and rates under the new tax regime for FY 2025-26, there has been a lot of confusion about tax on incomes slightly above Rs 12 lakh. For example, what happens when a person is earning Rs 12.1 lakh or Rs 12.5 lakh?</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIf your salary is a little over Rs 12 lakh, say Rs 12.10 lakh, you might expect to pay Rs 61,500 in income tax.  However, due to marginal relief, you won’t pay the full tax. This relief ensures that your total tax liability doesn’t exceed the tax you would have paid if your income were exactly Rs 12 lakh. So, while your tax on Rs 12.10 lakh would normally be Rs 61,500, marginal relief reduces it to Rs 25,000 (plus cess), saving you a significant amount in tax.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has cleared the doubts, saying the total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs 12,75,000.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>What is marginal tax relief?</strong></div>\n<div>\r\n\tMarginal tax relief is the relief provided by the income tax department when a person's income is marginally above the tax-free limit.</div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\"Marginal relief is a provision that grants relief to a taxpayer whose income may have just exceeded the threshold of a higher tax bracket so that he / she does not have to pay a tax higher than the additional income. While income up to Rs 12.75 lakh will be tax-free in the hands of salaried individuals by virtue of the slab rates and rebate along with the standard deduction of Rs 75,000, for non-salaried individuals, the benefit of a standard deduction will be available in the form of marginal relief making income up to Rs 12.75 lakh tax-free for the non-salaried individuals as well.

For Rs 12.1 lakh, the excess income is Rs 10,000. The relief is calculated by subtracting Rs 10,000 from the total tax liability, reducing the tax payable to just Rs 10,0<strong>00.</strong><small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Marginal relief is available to resident individuals whose income exceeds Rs 12 lakh but does not exceed Rs 12.75 lak</strong>h. If a taxpayer’s income exceeds Rs 12.75 lakh, marginal relief no longer applies, and they will be subject to the regular tax rates. <small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\tMr X, with a gross taxable income of Rs 14 lakh, claims deductions of Rs 1.75 lakh ( standard deduction of Rs 75,000  and deduction under Section 80CCD (2) for the NPS contribution by an employer for Rs 1 lakh). Although his income exceeds Rs 12 lakh, he’s not eligible for a rebate under Section 87A. Without marginal relief, his tax liability would be Rs 63,750. However, due to marginal relief, he pays only Rs 25,000, plus a 4% cess, making his final tax Rs 26,000. Marginal relief applies up to Rs 12.75 lakh, after which full tax is due according to the new tax slabs.<small class=\"brtagPara\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Rajarshi Dasgupta, Executive Director-Tax, AQUILAW explains the difference between salaried and non-salaried individuals and their tax exemptions:</strong></div></div></div></div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<div>\r\n\t\t\t\tUnion Budget 2025 has raised the income tax exemption threshold to INF 12 lakhs effectively making incomes up to this amount tax-free.

His wealth was estimated to range from $800 million to $13 billion, stemming from his family inheritance, horse breeding business, and investments in tourism and real estate.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tCommitment to global philanthropy</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Aga Khan, who held citizenship in Britain, France, Switzerland, and Portugal, used his wealth to improve conditions in impoverished parts of the world. In a 2007 interview with The New York Times, he stated that poverty often leads to desperation and extremism, and that by assisting the poor through business, he was helping prevent these issues.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe scope of the Aga Khan’s financial empire is difficult to gauge, with some estimates placing his wealth in the billions. His community of Ismailis, originally based in India, considers it a religious duty to contribute up to 10 per cent of their income to him as their steward.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<h3>\r\n\tThe Ismailis</h3>\n<div>\r\n\tThe Ismailis are a distinct sect within Shia Islam, emerging in the 8th century from a schism regarding the rightful succession of leadership after the Prophet Muhammad's death. They derive their name from Imam Isma'il ibn Jafar, whom they recognise as the seventh Imam. This group emphasises the esoteric interpretation of Islam, focusing on the deeper, allegorical meanings of the Quran, which sets them apart from more literalist Islamic sects.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIsmailism developed during a period of significant political and religious upheaval in the Islamic world. Following the death of Muhammad ibn Isma'il, the movement evolved, leading to the establishment of the Fatimid Caliphate in the 10th century, which marked a peak in Ismaili political power and cultural influence.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_6-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tIsmaili beliefs centre on the concept of an ongoing spiritual leadership through a line of Imams believed to be divinely appointed. The current leader is Karim Aga Khan IV, who plays a significant role in promoting social development and interfaith dialogue within and outside the community. The Ismailis practice a unique form of worship that differs from mainstream Islamic practices; for instance, they pray three times a day instead of five.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tToday, Ismailis are spread across more than 25 countries worldwide, with significant populations in India, Pakistan, Syria, Iran, and Canada. Their history in these regions often dates back over a millennium.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_7-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<em>(With agency inputs)</em></div></div>",

            "description": "<div id=\"parent_top_div\" style=\"margin:0 0\"><div id=\"between_article_content_1-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div><div>\n<strong>ACME Solar share price: </strong>Recently-listed solar energy company ACME Solar Holdings shares were buzzing in trade on Wednesday, February 5, 2025, as the scrip zoomed as much as 7.77 per cent to hit an intraday high of Rs 223.75 per share. ACME Solar made its stock market debut on November 13, 2024.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe uptick in ACME Solar share price came after domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal initiated coverage with ‘Buy’ rating for a target price of Rs 330, which reflects an upside potential of 58.95 per cent from the previous close (Feb 4) of Rs 207.60.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\t“We initiate coverage on ACME with a ‘Buy’ rating. We assign an EV/Ebitda multiple of 11x to FY28E Ebitda. Adjusting for net debt, we derive our TP of Rs 330, implying a 59 per upside potential. Our EV/Ebitda multiple is at a discount to competitors, such as NTPC Green, which is trading at ~14x FY28 EV/Ebitda. Further, the Street is currently attributing 15x EV/Ebitda to the renewable businesses of JSWE and Tata Power,” Motilal Oswal said in a note.</div><span style=\"display:block;height:1px\"> </span><div id=\"between_article_content_2-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnalysts at Motilal Oswal believe ACME Solar’s steep valuation discount compared to NTPC Green is unsustainable and should narrow in the coming quarters. They also noted that NTPC Green’s premium valuation is largely due to its lower financing costs (up to a 2 per interest rate advantage). However, this advantage is somewhat reduced as NTPC Green outsources both EPC and O&amp;M for its projects, whereas other players handle these functions in-house.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<em><strong>Given this, here are the top factors behind initiating coverage on ACME Solar share:</strong></em></div><div class=\"mb-20\"><div class=\"latestnews_stryalsoread__HlMna\"></div></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Diversified renewable energy portfolio</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnalysts said ACME Solar’s diversified portfolio includes ~7GW of renewable capacity (solar, wind, hybrid, and firm &amp; dispatchable renewable energy). With 86 per cent of its portfolio contracted with central off-takers like SECI, NTPC, and NHPC, the company ensures minimal counterparty risk. The portfolio consists of 49 per solar, 2 per wind, and 49 per hybrid/FDRE projects.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_3-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Strong Ebitda growth eyed</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tMotilal Oswal analysts noted that ACME Solar is set for strong earnings growth, with an estimated Ebitda CAGR of 52 per from FY24 to FY27. The company’s operational capacity is set to triple by FY27, and it continues to secure new projects, having won 1.9GW of new orders in FY25 so far.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>High visibility with PPAs in place </strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThe company has already signed PPAs for 100 per of its FY26 and 83 per of its FY27 capacity. This gives the company high visibility for future revenue streams. Additionally, it has secured grid connectivity for all under-construction projects, easing concerns about grid availability.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_4-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Focus on High-IRR, complex projects </strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tACME Solar’s growing focus on complex projects, like FDRE and hybrid systems, positions it well for strong returns (mid-to-high teens IRRs) as competition in traditional solar and wind projects has increased. The company’s investment in wind energy also sets it apart from competitors.</div>\n<div>\r\n\t“ACME is one of the few players building wind capabilities. This gives the company an edge over peers, such as NTPC Green, which is less focused on wind energy,” Motilal Oswal analysts said, in a note.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Capital and growth funding plans </strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAnalysts noted that the company plans to fund its pipeline through a combination of project debt, operating cash flow, and debt refinancing. With major capex planned for FY25-27, the company has already secured debt for 1.7GW of projects, and operating cash flow is expected to remain strong, aiding growth financing.</div><div id=\"between_article_content_5-0\" style=\"min-height:250px\"></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\n<strong>Key risks</strong></div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tThough ACME Solar remains confident in signing PPAs for all its under-construction projects, the increasing competitive pressure in the RE sector, especially for plain solar/wind projects, poses a risk. However, the company’s focus on complex projects with higher IRRs mitigates some of this risk.</div>\n<small class=\"brtag\"> </small>\n<div>\r\n\tAt 10:11 AM, ACME Solar share price was trading 6.65 per cent higher at Rs 221.40 per share. In comparison, BSE Sensex was trading 0.14 per cent lower at 78,471.32 levels.</div></div>",
